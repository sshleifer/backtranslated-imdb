Just when I thought it was safe to go back to the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer generated a mutant crocodile lurking to eat human flesh, released by another of those facilities that led the crazy science. The company Gereco Biotech is dedicated to the research of growth hormone and accidentally releases a baby crocodile that is evolving at an accelerated rate. <br /> <br /> The cast of the B movie adds a bit of fun to this run of the factory "genetic error monster movie". Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, the Australian accent, the hat, the big knife, the works, like a crocodile specialist hired by Gereco's executive, Joanna Pacula (... spent in the stereotyped role of a corrupt administrative executive who denies any participation with the gigantic beast in its facilities leave free in innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter, who works in the animal shelter. The telenovela star Matthew Borlenghi is the love interest of Longenecker, a local artist who welds sculptures (his brother is a victim of the crocodile). Of course, this ability will be very useful when our heroes install a trap created for the crocodile, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself is never as convincing as it does. Through a reservation in search of food, the special effects of a low-grade variety. As for Roger Corman's productions dealing with renegade dinosaurs, I'm staying with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often erect while chasing the possible victims. I felt that Mandylor and the filmmakers were cheating Crocodile Dundee with their crocodile hunter, and this imitation could have fun where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets his support in a hilarious way (.. drink).
