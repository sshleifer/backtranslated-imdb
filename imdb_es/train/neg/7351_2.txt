Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This will always be in the bad movie category, simply because Shu Qi's performance, except for Shu Qi's, was terrible. <br /> <br /> The Martial Angel tells Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who went straight after leaving his lover, Chi. Lam (Julian Cheung), two years before. But her past comes back to haunt her while Chi Lam is kidnapped for rescuing security software belonging to the company Cat works for. To rescue her, she calls her old friends from her orphanage days, to six other wrestling women , to save the day ... <br /> <br /> You may have told him the synopsis in a corny way, but this is a cheesy one. history. In fact, the entire script and the direction lacked any quality. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and combined with a plot as thin as rice paper in the water. If I could summarize it, take a bad movie of Jackie Chan, eliminate comedy, eliminate choreography, throw away the budget and you have Martial Angels: a work of formula without any imagination. <br /> <br /> Of course, I have to give credit where the credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person left unscathed from the terrible action, since it was his performance that shined. Okay, you can not say that she was excellent, after all, she had absolutely nothing to work with, but she managed to get some character out of her role. Apart from that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression, although they were mostly flashes and very brief. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie simply shattered. The scenes and the dialogues were completely unnatural and incredible, the special effects were obviously done at low cost without trying to clean the edges between the people and the mask of the blue screen, the poor editing involved numerous discontinuities in the fight scenes, angles of camera that were elementary and unattractive. And the direction I've seen better of a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I guess this movie was a matter of too many cooks. Probably, the budget was overwhelmed by the excessive enthusiasm of having seven babies on the same silver screen. That did not leave much more. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's Angels, it's not. In fact, although the sisters can do it themselves, none of that was really what is observed here. <br /> <br /> Definitely, one to forget.
