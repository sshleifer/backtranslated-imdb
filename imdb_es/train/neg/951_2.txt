*** It may contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If TOKYO'S LIVING TIME was a bold experiment in which the real-life actors received parts of the film on the condition that they would have to take a combination of a powerful anti-cancer drug anxiety with a prescription Medications against depression and antipsychotics (this is the classic combination of the psychiatric ward that turns patients into drooling zombies) during filming, then this movie would have much more interest. Or, if film production was another type of experiment in which all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As it is, this movie is full of lifeless, low-energy Actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, it seemed like he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting with each part of his body immobile. From the beginning to the end, your facial expression is best described as "near the dream". <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the actors who speak through the lines of others, as these actors can hardly finish erasing any line of dialogue. Everyone speaks in a monotonous and depressing voice. Without laughing There are no screams. Without force. Nobody has enough energy to smile. The result: total and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And the fact that the address is simple and amateur does not help. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie without life at all costs. Better to see GREENCARD who has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese romantic story, check out THE LONG VACATION, which has a lot of everything that DOES NOT LIVE AT TOKYO'S TIME.
