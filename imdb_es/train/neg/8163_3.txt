I agree with everything that people said about this, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST I've heard in my entire life. There are real voices during the moments when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk! And the voices are like a Broadway version of Danzig singing: "The darkness of the forest! Oh, the darkness of the dark and dark forest!" Or something else so unthreatening. The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble microphone on a section of synthesized strings and false drum rhythms. It is awful!! <br /> <br /> Yes, male drivers are horrible. That's how women are. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes, it's so bad! Everything they say revolves around being a man or a woman, simply reproducing the stereotypes to the fullest. Me sick. So boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children had so much echo in their lines that you could not understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost children always wear clean cut pants with a cute little bright blonde hair? It's not scary: STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was too clean and clean to be that of a man living in a cave. Nice beard and bangs, pa. Did you perfectly cut those with a knife or walked through the city and went to the living room? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
