Iberia is nice to watch on TV. But why watch this on silver screen? Lots of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, this could be your date. But otherwise, an hour and a half is too long. If you like to see dancing on the silver screen it is better to see the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breathing by taking the dance for a long film. The director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from the old experience. And from time to time it looks very good. but when the movie is an hour long, it should be interesting at least most of the time. There are many types of art, not everything is bigger than life and this movie is not too big.
