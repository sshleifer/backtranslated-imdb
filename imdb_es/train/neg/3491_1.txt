Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box did not bother to see this so-called "movie". They described "blinding choreography and violence." I did not see any "intrigue." Instead, I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I did not see "violence". At least, I saw nothing that could cause me to suspend my disbelief about what could possibly hurt a man with "waterproof" skin, but here maybe I am revealing too much of the "plot". Also, as a spectator of many and varied movies (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can say with authority that this piece of celluloid can not be seen. Regardless of what you decide to do, I will always stay <br /> <br /> Right, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. The choreography did not blind me.
