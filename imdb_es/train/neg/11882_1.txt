I spent this on the shelf a few times, looking at the large number of positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night I was in one of the movie channels and tuned nothing. I did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I only saw the first 30 minutes. Maybe the movie will become a golden comedy after that. Given the slowness, the slow pace and the complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character begins the film in the classic style "I do not know how to start my movie", with a long and boring monologue about how he does not want to be sued. It's not funny. It's not even remotely fun. Others have commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little giggle the first time he says it. Then he grinds it on the floor, smiling at the camera as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Superate yourself. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason why I did not like the movie instantly. Do not assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is learned, as is respect. <br /> <br /> From there, basically, you have a whiny fat guy who talks in a very effeminate way about his boring life as a temp. I did not realize that he is Jewish; It is a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor". It's just humor without grace. Just because you're Jewish does not mean you have a gift for comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I had seen would have worked, it could have stopped me. . But some gossip about how much you like the names of the women you work with, then list them for five long minutes, is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Do not let yourself be a victim of destination marketing. Just say no to "Haiku Tunnel".
