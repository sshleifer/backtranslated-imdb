Return of the Boogyman is an awful movie that does not play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a television series when they turn to older episodes. The return of Boogyman is just a clips show. <br /> <br /> The assembly of the film is constant and annoying setbacks of the first film. Again and again the same images. This is so boring. <br /> <br /> The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first movie I do not want to see The same scenes over and over again and I do not know who would do it. The whole movie seems like it was made quickly to make a few dollars and that's it.
