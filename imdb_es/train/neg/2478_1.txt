This movie is S-L-O-W. I spent most of the movie waiting for it to "start". <br /> <br /> The scenario was bleak, the script was grim, the cinematography was grim, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not that everything Low-budget films are bad, but this had no features exchangeable. <br /> <br /> The plot was consumed more with a vengeful and slightly deranged hunter than the real Wendigo, who made a brief appearance towards the end of the film.This in itself was disappointing since this 'Wendigo' it was just a strange mixture of a tree and a deer, everything about the film was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The child's parents seemed to be quite distant and, at times, seemed completely separated from their son. I'm sure if this was due to a bad performance or a bad script, but it only increased my levels of disappointment and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was nothing to think about, nothing to arouse interest, without real intrigue not a factor of coldness, this movie crackled so painfully I could not care less what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of Wendigo reminds me of the boring movie that is shown at the award ceremony towards the end of 'Mr Bean's Holiday': an artistic and meaningless film, which tries to be profound and meaningful, but that is presented as pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to see this again. I only saw it until the end with the vain hope that something interesting could happen ... but it was not like that.
