My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good 'Halloween' takeoff. A murderer who terrorizes young people, a white mask ... you understand me. We were dead badly! There is no wordplay. Not only do we discover one of the worst movies, it's also a cult classic! It is filled with holes in the plot and it does not make sense. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's it. I give credit for being filmed with a VERY low budget, I always support movies like that. It just is not in particular. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good to see if you are drunk or drugged; otherwise do not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
