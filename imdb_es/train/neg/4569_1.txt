I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so hard to call to attention that they would be ashamed to allow this show to take place there. This show is like a slap in the face to law enforcement officers who really work hard. Never before in my life have I seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy, that would be one thing, but to say that reality is nothing less than a lie. I only saw it once and I was horrified by what I saw. I wanted to see the little man get into a chase with a bad boy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing in the program was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the chief of police and all the officers should be ashamed and should never want to admit that they come from that city. No wonder he did not stay on television.
