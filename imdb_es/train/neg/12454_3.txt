I have been reading publications here about the Wonder Woman costume for this television movie. It should be noted at the time the film was made, that he was not wearing his traditional attire. In reality, the producers stuck to the conception of the WW comic writer for the early seventies. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, I have to agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was old enough to appreciate a movie about a comic book hero. However, I was so "absorbed" with the plot that I stopped seeing her three quarters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
