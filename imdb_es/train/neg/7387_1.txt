The DVD was a joke, the audio of the first few minutes was terrible with the sound out of sync and the voice of Segals not even his. Pathetic! When the audio synchronization improved in about 5 minutes, the plot, the lines and the poor actors should get another job because the film business is not where none of them should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good movies in the In the early days, the latter are a joke and should be a disgrace to him and to the company that did it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one who handled this, it is better to have another party in charge of the show. because he has no talent in this. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete shame to all those involved in its production and a shame to all who saw it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask for my money back at Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
