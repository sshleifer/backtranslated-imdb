This has to be one of the worst directions I've seen. The foreground can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene consists of nothing more than close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some beautiful landscapes to work with, the funds from Mexico, the canteens, the beautiful property where Anthony Quinn lives and the dusty cities that Costner travels on his trip for revenge. Unfortunately, we only glimpse these places quickly before the camera takes a picture of a large giant head. Even the transition scenes in which Costner drives only through Mexico are quickly reduced to a close-up. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things, too many people appear out of nowhere to help Costner, it's bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical suspense story, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered the most melodramatic score of the film. This movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads, this movie could have been visible.
