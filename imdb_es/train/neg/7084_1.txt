As many others have said, this is a terrible movie, from all aspects of film making. The way they managed to get some well-known actors to take this project is incredible. <br /> <br /> Many people have complained that it was filmed on "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was recorded on video, but not on "cheap" video. What did it wrong was lighting, white balance, shooting technique and editing. <br /> <br /> So many different shooting and editing techniques were used that it was a production disaster. Severe and inconsistent lighting, excessive use of manual shooting (Woody Allen wing), choppy editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen the scenes are embarrassing; Very fond. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes have no acting value at any level. <br /> <br /> The way this video was printed never surpasses me. It is worth looking, if only to be surprised at how bad it is.
