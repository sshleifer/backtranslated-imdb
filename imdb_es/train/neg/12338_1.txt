I saw this movie originally in the theater, when I was 10 years old. Even at that age, "humor" was a little insulting to my adolescent intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would shudder and start to feel very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I remembered the existence of this movie today, I was not sure why I felt that way. Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie, but my negative feelings toward two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently, I forgot that I saw this movie, but I unconsciously cried the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, moreover, YOU EAT the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I have not been brave enough to try to see him as an adult. I imagine that, as part of the healing process, I should probably consider confronting this fear of childhood so that I can * really * leave it behind. Certain regression therapy and / or hypnosis could not be a bad idea either.
