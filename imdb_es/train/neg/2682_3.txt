I really wanted to see this movie for a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise", which I found to be of great quality. I was so disappointed. The most realistic of all was the unpredictable ending that I think was partially stolen from "Return to Paradise." <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like Danes' character, I found her very upset first. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the movie. It could have done much better, for example, there could have been more emphasis on prison conditions and sheer horror. It was too cheerful a movie to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" ending. I could not have predicted that. But at that moment I really did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
