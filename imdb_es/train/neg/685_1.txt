My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the film would have to be at least worth seeing. We are wrong. In fact, we gave up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with an American accent was, for me, impossible to overcome; it is hard to believe that this is England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is a zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo an earlier comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their mutual love for no reason is ridiculous. There is no reason to worry about any of the characters, so we throw the towel in half. It was hard for me to believe that Hawks ran this, since none of the actors spoke with the Hawksian brand rat-a-tat delivery. So save time and jump this.
