No, not the GWB administration, the Decider / Strutter / Smirker, but the miniseries "Monarch Cove". Lifetime must have realized what a dog was because the series burned two episodes at a time, most of them aired between 11 p.m. Friday night and 1 a.m. Saturday mornings. As to why I saw everything, I can only advocate sudden attacks of weekly masochism. <br /> <br /> The majority of the cast are unknown and probably remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who indulge in the only decent performances (Jones can not pass the entire series, a lucky woman). Ward, by the way, is aging quite well from his days in "Thorn Birds." <br /> <br /> The only thread of the plot: who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly condemned for the murder of dad, but is released after six years in the slammer, goes on for so long and it is concluded so hastily that it will not particularly care who tries it. There is a lot of "crazy" sex, various murders and all kinds of rude behavior, virtually none of which is interesting or credible. The majority of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely has no talent. The writing and the direction are on par with the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stay until the end, the postcard is a very important matter. <br /> <br /> BE CONSIDERED OF US WARNINGS!
