Some very interesting camera work and a story with a lot of potential. But it never presents itself as anything more than a graduate thesis of a student in a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. In the first place, there is not a single pleasant character, not even a villain that we can admire for his impudence. Second, the whole performance is horrible, even by veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're at a picnic, but one of those picnics of miserable company employees where you drink too much cheap beer and you get your hangover before you stop drinking. Then you eat a little hotdog and you vomit. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm being a little rough with a young director who could still go places, as I said, the work with the camera is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But I feel cheated: the propaganda of this movie suggests that we will see a "modern western", and the DVD package has images that suggest this too, but in reality nobody connected to the movie. It seems to make it known that this is the kind of movie that they are supposed to be doing. <br /> <br /> That betrayal is what hurts; but even without that, the truth is that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed by the actors, the story is totally confusing and, in the final analysis, we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player in half. but the rental store would not return my money. <br /> <br /> Now, that really hurts.
