A friend and I rented this movie because it sounded great. But we were wrong. First of the performance ... wow ... the performance was the worst, the effects were also very bad, it looked like a movie made by a university student. The plot was pretty good, but it had been done. What most ruined the films were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor of all ... it's a shame that I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh, look at it .. but other than that ... stay away from this. Usually, I love the movies on the B list and that, but this ... I do not know how it was approved to be put on video ... this is the worst I've seen ... and I've seen some bad ones
