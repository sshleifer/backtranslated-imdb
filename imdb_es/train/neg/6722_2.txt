Once you sit down in a movie and after it ends, it's like a big "wtf !?" <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another film of video action fodder that you can forget immediately of having seen or, better yet, not seeing it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star in and are quickly squandered on this road, here are fast action fugitive mercenaries where the story is pretty bad and the action sucks and why watch an action movie if the action fails? Robert Patrick, in particular, reaches a new low in an action sequence that causes him to fire a machine gun while standing on the hood of a school bus in motion. Co-stars in the environment Charlotte Lewis and Scott Hylands himself (from the television Night Heat).
