Unlike others, I refuse to call this unfortunate excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance (I do not want to give a bad name to the style). Still, it is the most accurate description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> A useless assault, unpleasant and, ultimately, meaningless to the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" leaves one wondering why the movie was made in the first place. and who in their right mind gave the green light to this dark and tangled mess. A biography of porn star John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why he entered the business and how it affected him. Cool. Limit to be convincing, to be entertaining. Limit of being enlightening and fascinating at about one million levels (and I have no interest in pornography). <br /> <br /> But a confusing, violent study, in the style of Rashomon, of a series of murders with which he found Holmes after his career ended? Who in hell cares? What ideas do we get? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of the life of John Holmes: that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" could have been about anyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous adult movie star in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things worse a thousand times, the image is loaded with jerkoff tricks: annoying machine gun editions, careless Dogme-95 camera work, unnecessary graphics and animation on split screen, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and a unique main character, the director (and I use the term lightly) has put together a dozen techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting disaster a movie, among them: the modern, bypass aspect of "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Report of the minority"; the frantic, often incomprehensible, cut-film style in the air of "Natural Born Killers" or "28 days later"; the soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow", which fills every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the period. the sequence of retro and great titles of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can". The list goes on and on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I had real hopes for it. "Wonderland Avenue" had existed for years; If the context of the murders had been emphasized instead of the murders themselves, I think it could have worked. If the murders (and Holmes's growing involvement with the sordid types of ALL) had signaled the end of a career, or the end of the seventies, I think the film could have had a meaning; It could have served a purpose. As it is, without meaning. Useless. Who cares how many perspectives there are in a series of murders generally unknown to the public? The case is not famous enough to deserve such a thorough examination. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been the third act of "The Story of John Holmes". That's. Period. And it could have worked. What is that? Oh, right, right, they did not want to tell a traditional story of rise and fall. They did not want to do "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their movie to be different. True? <br /> <br /> Well, in a certain sense, they did it. There is a big difference between those films and "Wonderland". The difference is that those movies are good. <br /> <br />
