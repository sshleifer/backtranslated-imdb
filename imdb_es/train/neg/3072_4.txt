Margret Laurence probably did not intend for any of her novels to be adopted for the cinema, let alone the stone angel. Agar, as a character, was the one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dared, someone?), And ended up almost sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and the new, and the carnage (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the movie is reasonably true to the plot of the book (but it's not really a plot type, right?), I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of the movie. Hagar's challenge (for the sake of the challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much coarser than described, and Hagar's father could have played more "traditionally," so to speak. If the filmmaker insisted on more solid portraits, the film would take him directly to the home. <br /> <br /> Along the same lines, why should we see cell phones, organic products and other modernizations? Are we trying to make some points for the sake of making some points (for example, the Muslim bride and the natives)? Agar and co. In the book there is everything less politically correct, so why should we see that in the movie version? Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send politically correct subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the movie) seems like throwing punches below the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditioned to see the old people bitter as cute and adorable. Why should he laugh every time Hagar is in his tantrums? I doubt that Magaret Laurence wants his readers to laugh or Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of anguish, and all we do is laugh at them. I do not think that Hagar and other people in his situation did justice to him.
