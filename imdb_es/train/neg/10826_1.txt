I can not say that this is the worst movie of all time, but only because there are still some movies that I have not seen yet. This has to be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although it was not so bad in that movie.) The whole movie seems like you're seeing a guy trying to impress beyond his abilities. in his little director's chair and think "how would a great filmmaker handle this scene?" He just does not have it in. I do not know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker. Certainly, some nuggets of grandeur that could have been polished But nothing was done to mature The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in film history One by one when we see the characters singing, and I writhed in my seat. I kept saying "please, PLEASE, just do not let the kid on the verge of death sing too! "Indeed, LACK MASSIVE!
