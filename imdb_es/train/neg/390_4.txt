I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with season 5? (Or is it 6?) Things are getting too tired. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show, but it became Donald Trumps' own ego festival. Of course, it will be your company where you will work, but come on! Some of the things that say "they SEND" are only insulting. <br /> <br /> after watching the program, I would not want to work for him. Not because it is arrogant, pompous or similar. It's just that the show is not realistic and the way he handles things makes me nervous. Good entertainment? Yes, but exhausting as the stabbing in the back becomes so exhausting ... it's not a team effort, it's not personal, it's just a business. look at your back jack
