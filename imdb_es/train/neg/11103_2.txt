Well, I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was a decent movie in general, except for the story, which was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never got to know anything. about creatures, why they appeared, what are they doing in our world and, in fact, have they been on Earth before us or have we just come from space? Secondly, the butcher's role in maintaining order is so obviously created ... Really, how big could the subway have been for a substation? There were only so many of those creatures, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have placed some tactical bombs, or maybe clean the place and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see that the killing of people is NECESSARY ... In the third place, Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and bigger in stature. On the other hand, when he confronts the driver, he does nothing and acts like a puppet, observing all the abominations. I mean, okay, the driver had a spooky help (laughs), but if Leon was so brave he would have done everything possible ... I mean he risks his life first, and then does nothing exactly when he should have done it. He could have died like a hero, but he lives like a coward ... this might be the case, but not after having shown so much courage before ... Then, the policeman's thing ... come on! This was a city that has a subway, I bet there should be other cops except that lady, other police stations, this was really a bit silly ... Overall, a great performance by Vinnie Jones, an interesting idea right up to the point behind what is not really built at all ... By the way, what did the signs mean in the chest? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
