A prostitute witnesses a murder and becomes the murderer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really in a pretentious mood here: his camera turns around the corners of a museum (after having spent a long time on a painting of an ape), divides into a screen divided by artistic motives, practically gives his story with a sequence (again divided screen) where two characters are watching a TV show about transsexuals, and organizes its (first) end during a stormy storm. "Dressed to kill" is exhausting, mainly because it asks us to bring a lot and we do not return anything substantial. Much of the performance (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) end is a scam of De Palma's own "Carrie", not to mention "Psycho." The explanation of the dirty facts plays like a parody of Hitchcock, not a tribute. With a cold and steely style, the final results are half-distinguished. ** since ****
