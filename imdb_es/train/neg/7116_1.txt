* WARNING * Possible spoilers under <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. It seems that there is some attempt to increase the tension through poorly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns, but none of that works. <br /> <br /> MST3K did a pretty good job with him, but on its own the movie is mostly tedious. <br /> <br /> Funny moments: <br /> <br /> When the false skull comes out of a pile of ashes, the wife becomes hysterical and dizzy while the husband (who is trying to drive the crazy wife) he says in an expressionless voice "There is no skull there, no skull". <br /> <br /> When the real ghost skulls have the husband trapped in a gherkin, as if he were caught between first and second base. .
