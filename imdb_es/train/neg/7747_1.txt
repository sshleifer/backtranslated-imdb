The mere fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B movies, should warn you about the quality of this film. This is, however, not a B-movie. It's a movie D! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals, WOW, is the worst data animation made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the SCAAARY sabret√≠n on the cover. You only hear people scream, bleed and die and occasionally you see a tooth or a tiger leg. He is so fond! Maybee worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and tell him, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and I'm waiting for your reaction." <br /> <br /> The movie is too weak to give you a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
