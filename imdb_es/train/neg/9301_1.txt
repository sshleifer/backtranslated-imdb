Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this movie so that people can really see a 1/10. Where to start, we'll start from the top ... <br /> <br /> THE HISTORY: Do not believe the premise: the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finally understand what happens in the mysteries are. It's a basic movie, go to the cabin without intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> THE SCREEN: Usually, I give credit to independent screenwriters, it's hard work when you're starting ... but this is bullshit The story is flat: it leaves you without emotion the whole movie . The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable with lines of "Woah, you scared me completely" and "I was wondering if ... uh ... if you wanted ... uh, would you come to the cabin with me?" I want to tear all my hair, one strand at a time and give it to myself. <br /> <br /> THE CHARACTERS: HOLY QUANTITY !!!! Some have described the characters as planes, I want to go a step further and say that they actually have an inverse character arc. Actually, they begin to work in a parallel universe and almost begin to act backwards ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They already take characters already written and add a terrible dramatic performance in high school. The "Woah that scared me completely" was said in a monotonous and slow way, as if it were stupid. I could complain for hours only with the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNIQUE: LIGHTING: An eight year old boy would be disappointed with the lighting of this movie. Too bleak in areas, too bleach in others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to illuminate a basic scene correctly. Small steps! SOUND: How many sound boys do you need to make a movie that really sounds like shotty? 9. With so many sound guys, this should sound incredible, but the opposite has happened. There is one particular scene that really stands out, these guys drive in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle ... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm running out of room to complain ... rent it, I dare ... get it and learn from it ... give it a rating of 1 ... it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Approving ...
