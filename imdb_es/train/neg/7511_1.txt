This was one of the most ridiculous and misdirected movies I've seen in a long time. I've never liked Spike Lee, but I thought about trying it with this: serious error. The film is supposed to show how the murders in the real life of Sam's Son affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; What he really did was to focus on the more boring characters that I doubt anyone would worry about their drug problems, marriage problems, etc. The scenes that represent the murders are just that, and nothing more; A gunfight and then we will return to the Saturday Night Fever! What is even more ridiculous is the choice of Spike Lee to appear as a reporter in the film: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, that makes them even worse. The stupidest scene had to be the dog that spoke with a silly voice, which was represented in a scene before which was supposed to have been shot. Spike, what were you thinking about when you made this movie? Not thinking about anything is my guess. People who think they are going to see a criminal drama, follow my advice and do not waste their time or money on this loser. You better see Jerry Springer in this case! Film wasted, I gave it 1 out of 10: lousy.
