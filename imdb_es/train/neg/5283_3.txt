I waited anxiously for the first screening of this film since it was delivered to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for her the night before, I sat down to watch her with my daughter (17 years old and a student of Film Studies), with chocolates, of course, with great expectation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes, we knew we were sunk. The unstable shots and angles of the camera, bad photography in general, the direction and performances in wood had already left us discouraged and discouraged. Dejected, we saw them in. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strange and without any particular purpose, directly to the camera on several occasions, breaking our difficult "fantasy of the moment" and captivating us directly in a stalking style almost 'I'll find you'. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did the best he could with the script and direction, blessed him. However, I hope they paid him well, since he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave that supposedly broke the dam, soaking him and his co-actor. They were almost dragged to the sea. Health and safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting seawater to deliver his line. There probably was not enough money left in the kitten to re-shoot this scene. Someone with some sense would not have tried on a day like this in the first place. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon compensated. for the unconvincing portrait of Anthony Head of the annoying Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> Towards the long awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth seemed strangely to Grace with a visit every two seconds, having made great efforts to avoid it. She for most of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impairment that made him forget his reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilated, from one pillar to another in search of the good captain who, meanwhile, had managed to call almost all of Bath, we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without I have not even sweated. <br /> <br /> We did not experience any of Anne's charms crossing the screen. In fact, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had seen in the simple Anne, without opinion and without opinion, and why someone, anyone, did not say anything wrong, and joined Sir Walter to simply shut up. <br /> <br /> The crucial kiss, usually our favorite feminine moment, was painfully prolonged. As they approached, Anne continued to open and close her mouth, which had the effect on the screen of making her look like she was chewing gum before the lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the night before was the chocolates and the half-hour exchange of opinions between mother and daughter about how bad the film had been. <br /> <br /> What a pity. ruin such a charming and attractive story, filmed in some of the best scenery in England. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Jane.
