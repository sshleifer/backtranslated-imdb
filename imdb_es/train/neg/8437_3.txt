As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first movie House of Games that also starred Joe Mantegna, he expected great things from this movie. Instead, I found myself upset by the superficiality and lack of credibility of the film. The racial insults are thrown without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hope of establishing a racial tension that never materialized for me. The identity is fully re-evaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Due to his oaths taken as a policeman, the main character flatly refuses to perform a relatively small action that would not harm anyone and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action that is very violent and VERY illegal, but still deny the child. action. In addition, an incredibly incredible secondary plot is presented that involves a man who has killed his family only for the sake of a plot point that was almost not announced with the writing of heaven, and the police reaction to that situation extends beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after waiting for another exciting David Mamet thriller, I felt extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10
