I saw that movie, and it surprised me! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The film lies, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler had never hit anyone, he would not hit people with his fist, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: it's too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was smarter than what is shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader, because they can see that it is bad. So the real Hitler has not shown his bad side to people. <br /> <br /> Have any of you, the Yankees, seen the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? This is a great movie, with incredible actors. And it's a German movie. I think that this issue of Nazi Germany should not be made like a movie by people who know nothing about Germany. People! See "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad period for humans around of the world.
