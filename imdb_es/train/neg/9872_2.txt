It's a little hard to believe that the movie in this book can overcome its horror. The plot is so artificial and incredible. . . Starting with putting a ton of guilt on a small child to avoid his pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and perhaps more people (including the clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who, apparently, in the length of a ferry trip, goes from being relatively happy to kicking the prints shortly. A very unpleasant mother and coo-coo, helped, supported and supported by a group of politically correct friends. Moving the stage from an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, although it may have helped the budget of the filmmakers. The very beautiful buildings that supposedly house the monastery did not seem to adapt logically to an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this movie and her hairstyle certainly belongs to another decade. Also, there is simply no chemistry whatsoever between her and any of the male drivers. I did not like the book from which it was taken, but I read it all. The film that he kept navigating from one place to another had to leave every time the saccharine music was too intense. Unless you like an incredible story, a wooden performance, a contorted mixture of religious allegory / mythology / allegory, my advice is that you omit this one. Oh, and maybe a little criticism, but would not a loving father have a life jacket on a small child in a small boat? The best part of this movie is the landscape.
