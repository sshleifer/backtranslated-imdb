Aaron Spelling produced this fact for western television that becomes terribly difficult for a seventy-three minute film. It works as a probable failed pilot of the series. <br /> <br /> The handsome Clint Walker is US Marshal Dave Harmon, who is entering Yuma, Arizona, in time to kill one of the brothers of the local big shot rancher. find on a path. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican boy who sleeps in jail. One night, Andres is sleeping when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother to the street and kill him, fixing the murder on Walker. It's not good for your first twenty-four hours at work. Walker visits the local army fort and shoots the commander's chains. The big guy hears about the death of his brothers, and he returns to the city in time for his chains to sound too. The local native population, which is cut short by the army in its meat, also gets angry in the area of ​​the chains. With all these chains entangled, Walker still has time to attract the owner of the local hotel. The type of Army involved in the killing ends up dead, the buyer of local cattle is involved, the Indians make a lot of hesitant words and the climax provokes an unlikely confrontation, since Walker must prove to the people that the cattle-buying villain had a boss. , someone we have suspected has been too useful at all times. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-plot involving the death of Walker's family at the hands of the Army assailants, and I think this would have been the force behind the Series, if it had been picked up. Instead, the film ends abruptly and I kept waiting for scenes from the exciting episode next week. Due to the fading of the exits for nonexistent commercial breaks, the pace is based on this and its history jumps in shape. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, robust and has a deeper voice than a well. The rest of the cast is full of TV actors that you've probably seen in other television movies. Much of the action is pretty lame, and the violence is lukewarm. The first murdered brother receives a shotgun halfway, and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is the wrong movie that is used to teach children about the evil of weapons! Speaking of children, the Mexican child here goes from "cute" to "aneurysm inducing discomfort" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like westerns, then you will not like "Yuma". If you like westerns, then you will still be disgusted with "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not classified, but it contains physical violence and violence with firearms. <br /> <br />
