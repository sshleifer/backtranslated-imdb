I expected this movie to be a little entertaining, like other genres of its kind. However, I was lame and I did not find myself laughing a lot. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been fun, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be very funny, and he laughs a little here and there, but the film fails. Just do not go see this one. The address is mediocre, but for what it is, the address is not that important. I guess their main drawback is that it's not very fun. Look something else, do not waste your time here.
