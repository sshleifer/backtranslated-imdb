"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films that present strong performances, sometimes remarkable and high points, but unfortunately they are shattered and drastically slowed down by a cloudy plot and very little to interest the audience. It is starring Richard Widmark as a doctor working in a mental institution whose life becomes chaotic due to family problems and a quite ridiculous and overworked conflict that really does not seem to be a big problem. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd. . It is time for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. An old woman wants the curtains put on her, but many of the patients want to make theirs. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally exploding conflict erupts at the point where lives are in danger and families begin to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. <br /> <br /> The questioning of the logic of the plot and if it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real lunatic could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with acting. The cast that follows Widmark is composed of other great actors, many of them nominated for the Academy Awards and winners. And occasionally there is a moment in the movie that works brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid argument about window curtains. Unfortunately, there is a lot about the curtains doggone and therefore, the film slows down. Many of the shots are long and are made from the point of view of a camera, following the slow rhythm and the lack of interest in the visualization. <br /> <br /> In a brief analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized movie and it becomes evident. Why for the viewers basically as soon as the plot is focused, what does it do quite quickly? It really does not sound very fun to watch and I tell you it's not very fun to watch.
