When I first heard of "Solar Crisis" and then got a load from the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a large cast before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and expanding metropolises, this is a terribly small and claustrophobic feature. ; It feels like everyone is crouching together so the camera does not have to back up too much. <br /> <br /> And the effects, although good, are quite disappointing; we are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not deflect a deadly solar flare. But aside from screaming, sweating and a red glow above all, there is no real sense of emergence. <br /> <br /> Do not make me talk about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, and others are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feeling for the material is what no one can imagine. Makes you wonder who does not pay for condos in Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> And so far in the end ... Well, let's say it's tense and intriguing, but it's also too late in an effort like this. If I had kept that pace throughout the whole movie, I might have heard of "Solar Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for missed opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing garbage like this.
