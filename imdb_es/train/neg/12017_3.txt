I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and the Covert-one books, and many times I thought about how amazing they would be in a movie. Imagine my emotion, then, knowing that such a movie really existed! The 'Hades factor' being the first in the series seemed like an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the movie was disappointing. The simple elements of the film, like Griffin's first encounter with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and much less stimulating. Several characters are badly distributed, too. To begin with, Dorff is as pitiful as Smith. It is not a bad actor, it is an incredibly bad option, since it is too soft and does not present many of the characteristics that are definitive of John Smith. <br /> <br /> Rename, reassign and even omit certain characters further degrades this movie. For example, the elimination of Victor Tremont and all the background story of the virus, including the participation of VAXHAM makes the whole point of the film a little confusing. Marty Zellerbach is a very important part of the book, and in the seat it occupies a lot varies a back seat (not to mention that the character in the film does not share anything in common with the character in the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be Sophie Amsden's sister (she should be called Sophia Russel), but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, NOT "disguised". Which brings me to my final point, and I think it's one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this point! Not until the second book in the series is Covert-One, designed by the president as a preventive measure against biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could continue all day. In short, if you like books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed bitterly. Even as an action movie is quite normal, mainly due to the lack of brightness of the edition and the deficient effects. The story line and the boring ditch script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this movie.
