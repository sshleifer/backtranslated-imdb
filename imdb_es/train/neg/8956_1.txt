A rather disappointing prequel to the first two films, has nothing of the suspense of the first or the interest of the second. By concentrating on the types that "run" the cube, it basically eliminates any sense of tension inside the cube, since we simply do not care about the characters that are inside. Much of the film is simply boring, and it only becomes really terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the crazy green-eyed marina. After that, however, it simply descends into involuntary hilarity. However, the ending is appropriate, tying it back to the first indirectly. The script is terrible, the acting mediocre at best and the direction is not impressive. Much less follow-up
