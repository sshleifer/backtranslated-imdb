This movie was horrible. The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic, but it is written to take place in the real world, the effects of editing and lighting are worse than most of the first projects in film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone who does. : A) knows any details about the world of police or covert operations. B) knows any detail about the performance or appreciation of the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or below average mind, I think it would be nice if I was more stupid. If you must see this movie with all your mind, I recommend a bit of drunkenness. <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of the little production value you have.
