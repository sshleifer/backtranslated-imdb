I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were friendly policemen. They are, but Busey is in the opening scene and then does not reappear until 40 minutes into the movie. Although each scene in which it is is impressive. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind tramp. <br /> <br /> The incredible thing about this movie is the plot. In the movie, Fred Williamson is trying to find out who harass and kill sex operators on the phone. At one time I think it's Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not the killer, but he is calling and harassing the women by phone. Why? I do not know. No way is he connected to the killer, he only does it by kicking, I suppose.
