This is an incomprehensible piece of a horribly low budget. <br /> <br /> I do not even have the vocabulary to say how terrible, turgid, boring, confusing and I just miss that this effort is (Hey, what?) You already know that ...) Located in an America post - apocalyptic, some boys gather on a beach and killings and chaos take place. Everything was so incomprehensible that I could not understand it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the way this was picked up by National Lampoon totally defeats me: it's really horrible. <br /> <br /> And not in such a bad way is such a good cult. <br /> <br /> It's just horrible, terrible, horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, look at him with all the intention of loving him, then come back here and tell me what you think. Even gerbils in acid can not hope to understand this. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even better destroy ...
