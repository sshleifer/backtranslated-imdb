I really have problems to rate this movie. It is directed in a brilliant way, obviously there is a lot of money in it. Gere and the Danes are intense (although their screen personality could use a little more definition and seasoning), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those really sick films in which one can not help but wonder if the director himself likes to organize specific scenes and, yes, one can not help wondering how many imitators that movie will inspire. <Br /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to ask myself who are giving their money to produce a movie like this ...
