A big disappointment from the writer Hamm and the director Dante. His previous collaboration in the "first season" of the first season was twisted and very funny in all the right ways. This mishandling of an intriguing premise left me baffled. The supposed "reward" that shows the generic extraterrestrials that extract something from the brain of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet from its human infestation, why did they do it in such a sadistic and misogynistic manner so gratuitously? Why not trigger a completely lethal virus in Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of the male population carrying the females? I expected the episode to improve while I kept watching, but it became more pretentious and absurd. The religious subtext simply seemed forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought he was profound because of the weight he gave him. I like Dante's work as much as Hamm's, but this could not be seen.
