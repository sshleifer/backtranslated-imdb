It is unfortunate that you can not go lower than a star. Before watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 as the only movie that really deserved negative stars. To be fair, The Wicker Man does not detract from the enjoyment of a previous movie, but the fact is that my accumulated enjoyment of the film has been reduced to see it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick. it is often used in Hollywood when producers are too stingy to hire good writers or too fast to allow a plot to reach a satisfactory conclusion: slap and expect the audience to confuse it with something artistic or meaningful. It is a tactic that rarely succeeds and, in this case, only manages to splash the shame of a good actor and ridicule the producers. Even more in the sense that the conclusion "carefully elaborated" (or as they say) does not seem to logically follow the plot (which naturally I can not explain without introducing spoilers), and instead denies the merit that had the plot. until that moment. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that could logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles and, possibly, Nicholas Cage fans, but only to some of the general audience. If you really want something in this regard, I highly recommend The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan. In the absence of some kind of pill that erases the memory, I guess I need to see something better to get it out of my mind, for example, the attack of the killer tomatoes or the great adventure of Pee-wee?
