In 2004 I liked it. Then he became very stupid. It suggests that children do not have brains. The children are insulted. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows that I liked was Hamtaro. He managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children's programming. The program (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 tablespoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems as if today's television producers are only interested in making money, instead of getting involved in children's imagination and making money! Lately, my children are tuning in to the old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television can see its past and recycle children's programming since past times.
