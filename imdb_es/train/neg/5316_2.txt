Throw this dog with a bone. So bad ... you can look anyway. Kol (Ross Hagen) is a bad intergalactic guy who escapes being vaporized by a too jealous spaceship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crashes on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to return the dead or living villain. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger who exhorts to be careful in dealing with these two visitors from far, far away. The disguises are scandalous and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent surely took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of effort. So bad that it's almost comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Suns and Dawn Wildsmith.
