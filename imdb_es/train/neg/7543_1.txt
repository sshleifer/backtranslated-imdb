A soldier is on the side of the road making sure all passengers are obeying the speed limit (doing their job); then he stops a woman who appears to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); Then he is telling him what is wrong and BAM ... they kill them. Well, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I was watching this movie in the theater I was with some friends. This was our first night after the summer, so we wanted to go see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / suspense that looked good for everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste $ 7.00 on a movie ticket, but I had to sit through torture by the brain. This movie started with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought that "this can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it does not make sense; Even if you can ignore the bad performance, the plot "is not so scary", and the mess so horrible that this movie was, you'll still be baffled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, but because no human being with a brain can understand what this stupid movie is about. Right now you may be thinking, "Oh man, I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is." TAKE THOSE THOUGHTS OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW! I try to spare him the trouble of watching this movie by telling him that it's so bad that it does not make sense to even consider seeing it. Please, people do not make the same mistake that I thought that this movie has potential ... it does not. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero, I would do it), and I do not recommend anyone watching this movie, it will save many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. That damn movie is about.
