The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what ruined the equipment in this movie? The worst mix of music The worst edition The worst script THE WORST DIRECTION TO EVERY TIME The worst performance The worst choreography The worst cinematography The worst notes The worst sets The worst lighting Etc. Let's face it, if this "movie" had been in a contrast ultra high, black and white, and silent ... it would still have been horrible. All the scenes are dark (the people who light them call it "black"), often, the musical score drowned out the meandering dialogues, which was fine because nobody uttered two complete sentences without long pauses to achieve an effect. The "evil" robot was hilarious ... what was that? Dancing jazz Oh ... I guess I was supposed to walk tactically or something. I'm sure it caused fear in the hearts ... of the poor editors. And, how do you edit so much garbage material? Impossible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you mess it up. How could someone get this through the dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that I could not bear to see segments of more than 15 minutes, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lots of pauses) just to see if it has SOME good parts. NOPE! NONE! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a film ... a must for EVERY serious film student.
