I was always interested in something about Bigfoot, so when I was looking for a movie to rent, it caught my attention. They were the WORST $ 4.50 I've spent and I want to get my money back! Please, do not waste your money on this! This was one of the cheapest movies I've seen in my life. The whole movie was incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and I did not even see it at all. I just got fed up with that. The performance was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was really bad and tasteless. It all added up to be a really bad, boring movie and a total waste of time and money. I hope that someday they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then, I will have to sit through innumerable cheap crazy things like this to find the true masterpiece.
