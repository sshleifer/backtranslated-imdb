Is here. finally, a movie comes out that, honestly, I can say is worse than Larry the cable guy: health inspector. However, I am willing to bet that the Wayan brothers (hilarious) will earn more money than I would ever win in what will surely be one of the five worst movies of all time, outside of my fifth grade outside the Recreation of the Romeo and Juliet class. I really want to say WHY someone would watch this movie unless they were paid. The comedy is weak and all jokes, even remotely funny, of the flimsy plot, were surely revealed in commercials. The last word is that this movie was a terrible disappointment for me. And the commercials seemed so promising ...
