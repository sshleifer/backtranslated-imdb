Anyone who has seen Tammuz's Child Eaters knows that this is a director who can do better. Hopefully there were not too many hands on the boat (Telefilm anyone?) And that was a case of second feature concern. The characters are one-dimensional and more used. However, the landscape is fantastic and shows the beauty of the Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is excellent. Taken almost entirely outdoors, the images are sharp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind that blows through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically this movie is as good as it comes, it just lacks a heart.
