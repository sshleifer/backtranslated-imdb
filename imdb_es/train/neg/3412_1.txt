First, IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between that bad smell and this Pink Panther scam is that Town and Country was visible. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast signed up for this, so they could go to Europe with someone else's money. Belushi is especially irritating. His scene with Candy (doing a Dom DeLuise of degree Z) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of Shepherd without talent, and I bet the Gitmo prisoners would crack like nuts! <br /> <br /> The real "Crime" (besides having a green light) is the character of Shepherd: a mousy Wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy that, I have an oceanfront property in Arizona that may interest you.
