Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you should not do to make a good movie. Normally I am not a person who reviews a movie, but this is personal. I lost precious time that you can not return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching this shit. If it were a student project, I would have to say it's not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it becomes annoying. the screams, the bad audio, the bad video (a good cameraman could have done much better). And yes, what about the Blair-Witch effect? Without a budget? I had hoped that he would improve, but he does not. Now, how the hell does a 4 deserve? 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time! I said my peace.
