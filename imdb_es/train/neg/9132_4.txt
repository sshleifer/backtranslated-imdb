The diabolical plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if done the right way it could have been handled well, but instead it was executed poorly. Part of the reasons why this film was not so good was the poor dialogue, the cheap laughs, the choppy direction and the uneasy feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> The acting, on the other hand, It was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed photo. I found Sellers's description of the diabolical Manchu brilliantly done, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is a scene in which Fu Manchu is confused which fencer is the one who says: "Oh, you all look the same to me". I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud at that phrase. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with Helen Mirren as the pedestrian curator, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his latest film too, it's not a way of finishing a career), and Sid Ceasar (which gives a rather capricious interpretation of Al Capone's family member who works for the FBI). These characters also kept watching me. <br /> <br /> The sets were also pretty. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 were elegantly represented in this background image. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, my advice is to watch the movie if it's Peter Sellers or Sid. CÃ©sar fan. Otherwise, it is better that they decide to chew aluminum foil.
