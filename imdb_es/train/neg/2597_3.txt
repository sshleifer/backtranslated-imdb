Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through difficult periods, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After being a prodigious child actress, she descended into the darkness with mediocre films of low quality. While recovering from that dark past, this film is a reminder of the worst days of Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an interesting premise, reminiscent of "Raising Cain" by Brian De Palma; with a plot that deals with the multiple personality disorder that establishes the story for a horror thriller. Barrymore plays Holly Gooding, a young girl who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event in her past in which her other personality apparently killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past comes back to haunt her while her evil personality is back in her life ready to ruin her new peace and her new found love. In the midst of the chaos, her new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly face the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma's underestimated thriller, "Doppelganger" is for him. Most of it is a mediocre movie that not only never fulfills its purpose, but also ends in one of the worst endings of the history of cinema. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to maintain her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast, however, ranges from mediocre to terribly bad performances at the top, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and the influence of De Palma is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original by making literary references on almost every line, the dialogues are boring and the performance of the wood is useless. It has a good proportion of nudes and for strange reasons, and an excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary effects of make-up are done by outstanding KNBs and are really among the few good things in the film. However, the strange overuse of the effects in the end totally out of context diminishes the impact of KNB's work and makes what is surprising in a different movie surprising. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a B -Movie is no excuse for its poor quality, because with a better and more coherent script, this could have been an interesting movie. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre movie that gets worse every second. Worthy for the beauty of Barrymore. 3/10
