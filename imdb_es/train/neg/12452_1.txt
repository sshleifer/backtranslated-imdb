This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What the hell is wrong with the writers, producers and directors? How the hell did they get funds for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is bad at best, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is fine, but then it keeps repeating until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the best loser for not turning off this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he is in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10 because it is the lowest grade that IMDb has to offer. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: watch a Uwe Boll movie in your place ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
