This is really the worst movie I've seen in my life. Forever. Period. In fact, I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this amazing slice of a movie. Incredibly boring, bad acting, terrible script, often incoherent and too many scenes that do not seem to have any relevance to the film in general (as when a fellow priest of Heath Ledger is nailed to a wall by a ghost ... what was the point? In that scene? Answers on a postcard, please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have obtained a medal for continuing with this movie for all the execution time. I'd rather give a strong kick to the groin than sit in this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be included in the last 100 of IMDb. I hope that my 1/10 vote will help you on your way.
