Keep in mind that I have not seen the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. In fact, I'm doing research for the university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to point out that the person the main character was based on was actually completely different. Hollywood ideas about people and artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke fully supported hysterectomies to cure the madness in women, and never would have practiced something as liberal as the one depicted in the film. I think it's ridiculous to see several film critics who write for legitimate newspapers that say that this movie has a historical basis. The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please, do not waste your time in a movie with such indifference to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.
