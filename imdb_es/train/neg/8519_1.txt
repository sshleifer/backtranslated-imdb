I went to see this movie based on the review of Siskel and Ebert; Not only was I cheated, but I also took some friends and had to spend the rest of the day apologizing profusely for making them sit through this pointless shit. After this, I never went to see a movie based solely on the advice of Siskel & Ebert.
