This movie has the core of a really good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is a matter of heroes and legends. This film accumulates a good story with three endings (none satisfactory), a couple of unnecessary and unnecessary bar fights and two supposed "romantic" relationships that have as much spark as a dead bonfire. The rescue scenes are great, even if the generation of computers is very poor and the scenarios are quite unreal, but the background story is scant and disappointing. Costner is good, especially the performance of his hand (take care of him). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard navigators at the rescue center and is on camera for about two minutes throughout the film. It could have been an excellent movie, and Costner needs it.
