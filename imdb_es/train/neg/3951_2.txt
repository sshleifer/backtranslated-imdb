Ulli Lommel's 1980 film 'The Boogey Man' is not a classic, but it's worth taking a look at an above-average low-budget cooler. The sequel, 'Boogey Man II' of 1983 is, ultimately, a waste of time, but at least it is entertaining if you do not take it seriously. Now I left the door open for another sequel, and I would not have minded to see at least one more. One day, while browsing the videos in a store in the mall, I came across a movie called 'The Return of the Boogey Man'. When I discovered that it was a sequel to the previous films, I was happy to pay a few dollars for it ... I should have known better. Although the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3', this is not a sequel to those two very superior films that I mentioned earlier. Well, not totally anyway. <br /> <br /> Pros: Ha! That is a laugh. Is there anything good in this piece of cow dung? Let's see ... it has images of 'The Boogey Man' and, um ... it's fortunately brief. If that is all. <br /> <br /> Cons: Where to start? Decisions decisions. First of all, this movie is total boredom. It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or frightening happening. The action is rigid at best. The "actors" are the most likely friends of the director who had no experience as an actor before, and probably none since then. The plot is nonexistent and the script is written badly. The address is just horrible. The director tries to make the film have an artistic style by making the camera move, the lights flicker and with filters, but it does not add anything. The music is boring and hard to hear in parts. The ties with the original are unsuccessful. The character of Suzanna Love was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events described at the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is it not mentioned what happened in II? Finally, this does not add anything new or interesting to the series or the genre. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: the people who are behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. One thing is if that had been an original movie that was the director's first and that stunk. But instead, it's supposed to be a sequel to a movie that is not a masterpiece, but it's much more interesting and entertaining than this. If there is ever another sequel, which I doubt, then you must forget that this time it happened and be handled by Lommel himself or by someone who has at least some idea of ​​how to make a decent horror movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
