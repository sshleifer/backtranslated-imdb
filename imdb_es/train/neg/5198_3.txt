This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can not remember when I saw a worse one. I thought this would be about an airplane crash investigation. What really was a soap opera, and a bad one in that. They exaggerated the "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour or so looks like a party of screams, with some unlikely scenes thrown. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 'memorial' scene of 40 minutes or so (with the black umbrellas and rain needed for the fictional victims of the crash was lame, and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you relish the "conflict". <br /> <br />
