Adrianne, you really should get a life without Mr. "Brady". She gives me nausea and has been one of the main reasons why I know to tune the program more. It's a pretty foolish show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be under the scope and analyzed until death. This makes them see / sound that they are all less prepared for marriage and, nevertheless, I know that these disagreements are part of life. I guess for some people this is entertainment. If this happens next season, I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life, but watch this garbage. Although I would not be terribly surprised. I can not stand the commercials of this show anymore! I hope you are getting enough money to be constantly ashamed in front of a camera week after week. However, the "A" girl has a big butt!
