Wonderful actors <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too big an address either. My main problem was that I simply did not care about any of these people. Not the murderer, not the victims. The adjustments were quite monotonous. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I did not even care when the end came. He recovered his son. What a thing! I wanted my money back.
