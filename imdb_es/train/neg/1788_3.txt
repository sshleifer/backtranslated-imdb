Giving credit where it is due, only the technicolor, the costumes and the sets deserve an honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is as clumsy as you could imagine, and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to repair it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely silly with a page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a heroin role in disguise that requires her to look at Bing with adoration and little else, except for a couple of ballads that are not inspired by a voice probably bent for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible! The ingenuity of Mark Twain is not evident in any of the scripts. Only the enthusiastic fans of Crosby can appreciate this mess of a movie that has been given without guidance. Even the extras do not seem to know what they are supposed to do. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Bored as dishwashing water. Not recommended, even for children.
