"The triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It's a heavy, heavy job, 4 hours of torture. Actually, it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed a lot longer. It hurts me to even think about the amateur performances of actors as good as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Secondary players are not that horrible. Maybe they were trying to be so exaggerated, like clowns, but, if so, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not impress in one way or another. She (he) is there. I suppose that the work of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 years ago, is much better. It could not be worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the work. I do not know what she thought when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything was lost in the translation.
