Slow and full of inaccuracy. Regardless of its shortcomings, this is still an interesting account of the famous and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas struggle for Mexican independence. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This project made for television is also starring David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
