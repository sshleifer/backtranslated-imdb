['Lately, they&#39;ve been trying to monopolize this movie late at night in cable TV commercials. Do not believe in the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people to see this stinker in the movies. This is, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all time, right behind Mac &amp; Me (# 1 Worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I must admit that they are all close and TERRIBLE. Actually, none of this movie is funny or annoying, or anything that it claims to be, so do not waste your money. The only thing for which it is good is to give your worst enemy. I&#39;m not lying about that. Someone who would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this movie. It is so horrible. If you do not believe me, then you deserve to suffer the misery of seeing this, which I doubt you can finish. Two thumbs enthusiastically down.']
