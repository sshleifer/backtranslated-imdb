I entered the theater to the Captain of heaven in 2004 waiting for a good movie. Almost all the criticisms of this film had been positive, the effects seemed attractive, the previews were convincing. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the disappointment does not describe the feeling I had of this movie. It was anger. <br /> <br /> Beyond being boring and poorly written, the reason why this film gets 2 out of 10 stars is because all the material in the film was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a homage and theft: this was theft. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not steal to advance a point or move the plot along. They stole only to prove they could. Literally, it does not make sense to show a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a movie theater at the beginning of the movie, except to set up another scene (which I will not explain) that steals from the same movie. It goes without saying that every concept in the film was not original or even a twist to an old concept: it was literally a repetition of something I had already seen, from pulp-age robots that resemble the old Superman cartoons and the recent film "The Iron Giant", for the silent martial artist of the villain that has been used in innumerable films, more recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace". <br /> <br /> On the subject of the real movie, most of the performances were completely made of wood. Perhaps this is because the entire film was made on a blue screen, with computer images that complete everything except the actors. Frankly, this is no excuse for bad acting. If a person was ever a child, he understands that the lack of visual reference is not an excuse for not trying. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The protagonists are the only real human beings here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the film can be counted on one hand. If the robots are attacking the entire planet, should not we expect to see masses of humanity fleeing from them? The performance below half of the main characters prevents us from connecting with, really, anything here. <br /> <br /> The movie was not the worst movie in the world, so I did not give it a 1 Rather, the film was an example of everything that is wrong with modern action movies: the filmmakers tried Justify the film with special effects, but without an artistic vision or originality of any kind, it deflates.
