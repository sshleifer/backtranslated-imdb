Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are supposedly a hot topic on this journey of death; a luxurious 747 passenger plane adorned to look like a nightclub-bar-hotel? There is even a blind pianist who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b! $ 3 and she will do anything to get the attention of her husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and then the rest of the people on board. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments: Boeing 747 making a flop in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen blows the chops when she goes too far, and the furniture (and the screaming people) become 'ball bearings' in a pinball machine that sinks. ' <br /> <br /> The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but there is not much between them. Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel, but I forget why not. It would have done wonders with the original of 1970, in which this sequel is partially inspired ('77 was also inspired by 'The Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /> <br /> The actors Cotten and De Havilland gather from their days in 'Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (apparently they are not playing heavy here, they only meet for lovers of the autumn years). And it is not the actress who plays Emily's companion who played the maid in the death of "What happened to Baby Jane?" <br /> <br /> The television actors include the girlfriend of "Mayberry RFD" (her the daughter of a character wins a drawing contest, or something like that), `Buck Rogers' Gil Gerard and` Dynasty 'Pamela Bellwood. <br /> <br />
