The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance: what a ridiculous title is so utterly deceptive. It is not surprising that the filmmakers try to deceive us because this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupor, it is invariably an unintentional comedy in the form of an atrocious dialogue delivered by a group of hopeless voice artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors they're voicing appear as a group of recovery-level idiots. It is really difficult to determine how bad the performance is when you have such a huge dubbing. But the artists of the voice can not be blamed for the script. Thats false. Without wanting funny at best, pathetic at worst. History in general is, to say the least, unequal. The female characters are particularly idiots; Men are creepy or tedious. <br /> <br /> The whole company smells like pure exploitation of the audience. It does not deliver remotely what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start to happen, they all happen off the screen. All we get is some half-head shots. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this movie is a giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys the Italian thrillers should give this film a broad detour, as there is nothing remotely exciting about it. It's basically a soft core porn movie with an angle of horror. But it is not very erotic either. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
