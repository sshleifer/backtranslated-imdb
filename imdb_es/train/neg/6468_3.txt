It's a good thing that The Score came to Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I'd hate to think he's coming out with Free Money. It's not what your fans should remind you of. <br /> <br /> Brando in his later years is more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film that Welles would have done looking for funding for his own work. Brando is the director of a local prison that in the United States, when he is in a small rural setting, is usually the largest employer in the area. That gives the person in charge a great influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has a weakness that he commits, his two twin bimbos also known as daughters. Even when they get pregnant simultaneously by a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to dad. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid because Brando is willing to give them work in the prison where they work. Under conditions not much better than those convicts have. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train that crosses the town from time to time carrying money used to be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it is well below the talent of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also an FBI agent with a direct arrow. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the cast worked with someone that Many qualify as the best American actor of the last century. If it were not for the presence of Brando and about 40 years ago, Free Money would be playing on the drive-in circuit in the US red state, where the population could see how they are being satirized. <br /> <br /> Or a weak attempt is made to satirize them.
