Oh, poor Hamlet. I met him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS VERSION IS THE SAME! I do not know who of all the people put the money for this disaster, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and turned it into the most boring melodrama you can imagine. This version is literally so bad, that even the presence of a great actor like Maximilian Schell in the lead role can not save her. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it was an excellent fodder for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this one. <br /> <br /> But either way, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he had been alive when they did this, would not have wanted his name to be associated with that. This "Hamlet" is not so bad, that's good; It is simply bad. Absolutely terrible.
