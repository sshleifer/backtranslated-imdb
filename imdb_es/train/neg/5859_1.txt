Turkish cinema has a big problem. The directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folkloric, but they want to be international. This brings kitsch results like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has jokes translated into Turkish Spanish and has no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for the Turkish public after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, including Ferhan SENSOY have a worse than average performance. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. So Cuba is thought of as a banana republic. <br /> <br /> A waste of money, a waste of time.
