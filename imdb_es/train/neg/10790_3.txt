First of all, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, because the usual pattern of creating a blockbuster is to hit below the waist. This film is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as implied by the director and marketing announcements. In my opinion, the only purpose of this film is to earn money by touching a sensitive moral (in fact, it is mostly considered taboo in the native country). Cheap populism could provide a brief definition of what I meant. <br /> <br /> However, the performance is almost perfect. In fact, the majority of the cast has a theatrical background and made an effort to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All cast members were perfectly suited to their duties and were well qualified for the job, even the least experienced. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of thanks, just because he knows very well how to choose the cast. Apart from that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself as a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that only consists of dealing with naked / half-naked women. And just because the media boast, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and or something real artistic, I'm waiting anxiously to applaud your next job. I hope, this time you achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In summary; Pros> Good acting, attractive women (kidding!) :) Cons> Each and every one of the things, except the cast
