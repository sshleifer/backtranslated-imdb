This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this, they should be men enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I had known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I'm tired of it. I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It's been several days and I still have a bad taste in my mouth about this movie. I have never been disappointed by a movie anymore, nor have I written a comment about a bad movie. I really believe that the real deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, nobody would have seen it.
