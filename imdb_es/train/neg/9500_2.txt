This movie is very bad. The acting is just horrible, except Michael Ironside. I do not understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc gangs. He arrives in a city and, suddenly, he is chosen to fight against the bad people who want indigenous lands. On the cover, he said that he himself was an Indian who also returned to his hometown, I did not hear it in the film, if it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor Rigid and ugly. He said that his lines also like it. And we do not talk about Sean Young, she has not been one of my favorite actors, but in this film she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is horrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> I do not see this unless I think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> Soon I will update the casting list because I have it at home. I wrote it after having seen the movie.
