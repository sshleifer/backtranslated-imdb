['The worst movie I&#39;ve seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, there is no humor, there is nothing! The action sequences look more like a series of random ads of Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up stitched together. Very influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed. <br /><br /> I did not have many expectations, but seeing this movie is an exasperating experience that makes you wonder &quot;What were these guys thinking?&quot; <br /><br /> The only thing you could remember after seeing it is an anorexic bikini in Kareena. <br /><br /> The reason why I did not give it a &#39;1&#39; rating is that every time I see the worst, Bollywood shows me that I am wrong.']
