I think the scarecrows are scary, so it's a pity that this movie does not make any more of them. <br /> <br /> A group of thieves makes an emergency parachute from a plane to a huge field with scarecrows. One of them is lost with the booty, and the rest chases him while he is attacked by inexplicable scarecrows. The performance is hammy and the scarecrows do not impress (when they move). On the positive side, the director gets some suspense from the static scarecrows. It's like Alfred Hitchcock says: "A bomb under a table goes off, and that's a surprise, we know that the bomb is under the table, but not when it's going to shoot, and that's suspense."
