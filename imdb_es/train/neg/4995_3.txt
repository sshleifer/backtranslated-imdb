It seemed like a real task to sit through this movie. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to advance the plot and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations that seemed strange to the film. These conversations changed between family groups and the observer was left to try to reconstruct the common thread that united them. It's rare that I rate such a low movie and, in this case, do it, since the whole visual experience left me thinking "so what?" And "why did I waste my time watching this?"
