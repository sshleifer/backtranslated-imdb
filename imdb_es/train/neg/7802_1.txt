A chemical spill is turning people into zombies. It depends on two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's a film by Andreas Schnaas, so you know what the pair of the course will be. Bad acting, horribly horrible special effects, and no budget to talk about. The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a word about this piece of excrement, much less the ten obligatory lines due to the guidelines that IMDb gave me. My original review of only one word: Shit would not fly, so I have to review it and go beyond how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... wait, I think I can have enough words or lines to pass this review. Which is great, I suppose. So in summary: this movie sucks balls, do not see it. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
