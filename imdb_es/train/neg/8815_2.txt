Yes, I'm just going to talk about this, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (which should not be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this was not so good. It started interesting enough to see the villain (if you can call him that) look at the neighborhood kids and write in books about who is naughty and kind, but after a while you're looking for some action and this movie does not work. You need character development, but this goes further and you're still not sure why the hell the guy clicks. About an hour kills three out of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills are not even his targets, they're just making fun of him. This is one of the killer's many failed attempts to hit the naughty. Then he proceeds to try to kill this other guy, and tries to break into his house pressing against the fireplace. He quickly gets stuck and barely gets out. Then he goes through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by suffocating him in his room. It seems that he can not kill the man in this way, so he grabs a star from the tree and cuts his throat. What the hell was a tree doing in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yes, the killer before this murder stopped at a party and also had a little fun. Well, that's all, except for the people of the town who chase him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and the melody he wants to play. What was that even? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. As you finish asking, well since I have spoilers I'll tell you. He runs off the road in his truck and continues, well, let's say he was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
