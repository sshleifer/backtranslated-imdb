I saw it on a whim because it was available and I heard that Thumb movies were fun. This was not Most of the jokes were based on the physicist of "Geranium" and, in turn, on that of Kate Winslet. I think it's really pathetic that the creators of "Thumbtanic" lean so low to make a respected actress jabs simply because she (God forbid) is not starving in the ideal modern beauty model. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that says something like: "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's sail to this improvised raft that no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of fun from a 26-minute movie does not redeem its value.
