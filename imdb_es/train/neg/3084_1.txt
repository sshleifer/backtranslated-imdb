this is the result. A trash movie that does not deserve to be classified as a movie, it's just a lot of things in a film reel, which does not make any sense. Well, let's go back to the actors, who from the beginning seem to be just a group of friends who thought they could put together a small amount of money and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's a great horror anyway, it does not matter if it's a movie. There are many terrifying acts in "Hobgoblins", but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who is too weak for even a kind of root. Well, when you launch a group of friends and you try to make the movie scary, with a very small budget, nothing less, this is what will happen. Oh, well, at least the MST3K version was very funny. But this is still a horrible movie, which deserves all the hits it receives. 9 for the MST version.
