This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have a super power to please himself orally, I consider the film to be in the realm of 14-year-old male fantasy fantasies. The scene in the bed room was exaggerated and reduced an intimate moment in a farce of biological functions similar to passing gas in public. From the first, each of the other scenes was a discussion about how little sex they were getting, how much time has passed since they had it, when will be their next sexual relationship and who should they be with. Besides that, dialogue and acting were very poor and very forced, they did not feel, and they filled their lack of content with sordid sex scenes. This could have been really fun because the concept is really interesting but it is badly executed here. Please, do not even think about taking someone under 16 if you have to go see him.
