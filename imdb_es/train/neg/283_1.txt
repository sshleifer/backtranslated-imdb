For the movie, this movie felt like one of those specials after school, only with a lower budget and everything else. I guess it was supposed to be an inspirational movie of some kind, but it did not work for me. as predicy.it has very pale tones of Flash Dance, but then, what? There is simply no enthusiasm in this movie. The dialogue is contrived and cliché until death. Of course, the whole movie feels like a cliché from the 80s. The performance was less than stellar, although that has a lot to do with what the actors were given (or in this case, not) to work with. On top of that, there are bad song choices, with really bad lyrics. I felt embarrassed by all the actors involved. Everyone is talented, but you can not say about this movie. This is just my opinion, of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe a 1/10
