Was this the best movie I've seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's good to see something light and fun. It was great, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> I think he definitely had something to improve, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. They obviously do not care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at this than at The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a very important role as to whether it is a success or a failure. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast did not work. Maybe too many things were happening. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk about a normal movie, not a terrible one. It could be just a movie for girls. Something like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about that. :)
