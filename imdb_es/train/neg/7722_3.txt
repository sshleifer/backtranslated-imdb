Extremely poor action movie starring always wood Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a companion role that seems to never give up. The action is, at best, a bit of nudity and, yes, Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> The configuration is the usual renegade police forced to enter a new partner in a large case, the manufacturers at least try to turn the formula around, which makes Lundgren the policeman with oriental values and Lee the It is a modern city, but there is no development of characters, which makes it almost comical, the Lundgrens oriental warrior costume for the great confrontation must be seen to be believed. The action sequences are by numbers and Lee (who would continue to do the excellent The Crow) never has the scope to show any shine of martial arts in particular. But given his illustrious sonship, he must have been under tremendous pressure and it was much better not to have to live up to his father by assuming a very different role in The Crow, which showed in which unique actor he has become. if it were not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a Lundgren fan or a fan of 80's style action movies (think Cobra, etc.), then avoid it. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
