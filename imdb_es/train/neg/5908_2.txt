This is a little better than the first. It still relies heavily on his humor, which basically goes on saying that the old Bond movies were not realistic. That wears out after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this case. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous amount of total humor. Hopefully one day the real comedy will return.
