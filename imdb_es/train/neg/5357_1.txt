I do not know where to start. This movie looks a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning shows they used to do in the late eighties in the early nineties. Something like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It is full of bad digital overlays and "secret agencies" and villains with a really cheesy sound. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity until now. It seems as if someone had put together a lot of scenes and had forgotten that there was supposed to be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film arrives early, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agent car. For some reason, despite the fact that the device is clearly declared as "detonated from a distance", the bad guys decide to chase her on their motorcycles while driving away. This persecution continues. All the time with the bad guys doing silly bike tricks and completely pointless. Standing on the bikes, making flyers and so on. At one point, a crash occurs and one of the attackers is thrown from his bicycle, we see the bicycle (clearly CGI) thrown over the agents' car, but the rider has disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the rider and the bicycle return ... apparently without suffering damage from the crash. At this point, even though the car has an explosive device placed on it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving and then blow up their car. What was also clearly done with CGI. Sound confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I could point out that when I say CGI, we're not talking about the Lord of the Rings type here. We're talking about cheap cgi-type Power Rangers, actually I think it would have been better in the Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd made this movie, I'll never know, I can only assume that I did it for money, as a favor for someone or because they were blackmailed into it ... probably the last one.
