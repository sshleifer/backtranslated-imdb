It is not a bad start for the program, but it is a slap in the face of the application of the real law. The worst part of the series is that it tries to bill itself as a reality, and it's anything but that. Men and women who dedicate their lives to enforcing laws deserve better than this. What is next, the medical school in a minute? Charo making lipo? Charles Grodin assisting in a hip replacement? Come on ... show a little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are publishing the program as on stage. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can you use the car-to-car shot of the Taco Bell in the background?), Corny siren effects (the same loop was added nauseum to each "call", either a rotary code or not), and the last, but not least: more security problems for officers than you could shake a cane. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to see the manufactured police work and the fake cops, I would see RENO 911.
