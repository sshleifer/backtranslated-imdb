I'm the guy who usually keeps the opinions to himself, but I just came back from this movie and I felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of horror. But what does a horror movie do? I like to see even a little bit of good development of scripts and characters. I know that horror movies are often missing, but Prom Night seemed like I had not even made any effort in that department. Next, we all love the suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yes, the night of dancing did not have any of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night has that? No, he has a nice guy with a cute lil knife. And when all else fails ... at least the horror has its guilty pleasure of making it enjoyable like Gore Gore Gore and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well, when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 as Prom Night, they also leave that out. So, with all these missing elements, I ask ... does this still count as a horror movie? No I would call it more than a comedy. The people in my theater were laughing more about this than when I saw "Semi-Pro" that was supposed to be a comedy (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I'm going to have to give up the new horror. All the good horror movies of the old days have become garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see him did not even know that this was a remake! What made me angry! I wonder what will happen when there are no more films to remake. Where will the terror go?
