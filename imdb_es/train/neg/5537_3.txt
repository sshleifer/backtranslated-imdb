What? Did not you know that Scooby-Doo fought zombies? Well, you may not even notice this little movie directed by Victor Halperin, who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably make it the second zombie movie made. <br /> <br /> No, do not go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and do not even look for any. the brains are eaten. This is 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> Therefore, what you will see is typical of the time: to talk a lot. <br /> <br /> You have the chance to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and the eyes of Bela Lugosi, but that's it. Zombies in Cambodia, by the way!
