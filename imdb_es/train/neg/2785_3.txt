I know that some films (I mean: European films), which are very bad movies, are being considered as big movie theaters by certain "critics", just because they are not American. I saw the score of 8.1 IMDB for this film and noticed the fact that I was being selected for certain big festivals. Do not let this fool you! Unless you are one of those people who like movies to numb the mind, and then call them great works of art, skip them! The film contains a hilarious scene after another (a similar film, Italian, appeared in my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only boring, like other strangely praised movies, but they almost play like a camp. I mean, let's face it, the performance is horrible (I mean telenovela level), the story does not have a surprise (this has been done countless times before, connecting several stories: SHORT SHORTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAYING BY HEART, just Much better), there is no realistic character in it (there is a real fan on the road, note the hilarious zombie daughter), and so on. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough, the movie is 135 min. (Tell it!) Long, and in the end the director opens his can of sentimentality. After a movie with such a hilariously bad dialogue and scenes that made the audience in the screening projection laugh at so much incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema, and only receives high marks because it is in " another "language, in this case Spanish. Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
