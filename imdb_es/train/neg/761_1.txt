Absolute garbage. The reason why this is so terrible is not because it has deviated from the formula, but because the plot was simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did nothing to solve the case, nor did anyone else, it was just routine police work. Completely tedious <br /> <br /> You sat down to the end hoping for a turn, and you got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential in having a relative in an apparent kidnapping. Could the Lieutenant's personal involvement finally cloud his judgment? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were from a stranger who did it. But surely a genius like Lieutenant C, by having a constant conversation with the offended husband, will gradually discover a diabolical plot involving a tape recorder who plays in the bathroom while a masked boyfriend surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues . It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
