"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic subjects like pseudo-patriotism. Here, the travelers of the future try to ruin Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with his puppy monster, the golden three-headed dragon, King Ghidorah. However, they fail and in the end Godzilla fights against Ghidorah. The battles between the two giants are very good, but the plot of the film is full of holes and everything related to "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten with respect the enemies of Japan, making them great and blond, which are easily mocked by the intelligent Japanese. The good news is that, in the end, Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed both Japan and their ridiculous foes in one (actually two) spectacular combats. But until this real battle, the movie was really boring and pathetic.
