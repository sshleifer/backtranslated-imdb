Good movies can not be based solely on a beautiful garden and the top of a hill. Surprised to see him he has won two prizes. Very overrated. The first time I saw that kind of Chinese movies was visually impressive, BUT also with something really captivating to say, well, more than 10 years ago and I'm sure there's still more to come. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
