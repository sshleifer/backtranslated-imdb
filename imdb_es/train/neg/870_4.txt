Towards the end of this thriller, the emaciated image of Ally Sheedy is used creatively to compose more of a wicked and evil image. She convinces one that, if presented with an unpleasant type Bette Davis paper, she could do it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see this. If you've wondered how Sheedy looks in a pair of outdated glasses (but why should someone do it?), Then this is your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex-starved madwoman is really exhausting, and even if you like this kind of thing more than I do, you must admit that the tension is severely depleted during these scenes. Savage's drunken beast of an insurance agent is equally unpleasant, but at least it is a small role. Of the main actors, Nicholas Walker does not inspire any sympathy for the difficult situation of Paul Keller and his performance is made of wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level goes up a bit. Sheedy's meticulous and discreet performance (although it often seems to be on autopilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. The sets are monotonous, the camera work is not distinguished.
