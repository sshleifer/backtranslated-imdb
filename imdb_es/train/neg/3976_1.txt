The plot was boring, the girls were sick and the supposed Italian male leader had clearly never heard an Italian accent. Someone said that the guys were cute in this movie, but that it seemed to be full of mediocre people. Literally, there were no redeeming features of this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a graveyard for the actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people without any discernible reason. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the public eye to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
