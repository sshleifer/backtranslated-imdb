I would rather have 20 root channels than go through this movie again. The Prince of Molestas, Myles Berkowitz, has lost almost two hours of my life with this cynical pseudo-cool. The only fun of all this mess is the repulsive repulsive Samaha on tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great concept and grind it in the dust. It is choppy and badly done, in an apparent effort to make it look tense or funny. It is none. I rarely feel that a movie was a waste of film (or tape), but it qualifies for that distinction. If an appointment suggests watching this movie, run.
