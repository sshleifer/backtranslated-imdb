From time to time, a group of friends, with a minimum budget but with bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low-budget masterpiece that will sweep the world of horror. Raimi and co. He did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and his friends were successful with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his teammates, however, are destined to wallow forever in relative darkness if Zombie Bloodbath is something to go through. A lesson on how not to make a cheap horror, this miserable effort (about a plague of meat-eating zombies) serves as a reminder that while many people have access to a video camera, most should not take it. that's his attempt to make his hand to make a long-lasting movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets does not have an eye for a well-framed picture (some of the angles and movements of his camera are really pretty good), but rather that a) he has a lousy script b) he has a bad song, and c) he does not realize that he has a bad script and cast. Which means that the final film is extremely amateurish, and it is unlikely that it will be seen in its totality by people who are not finalists of the zombie movie (like me) or cast members and the team (like those who have given favorable comments to the movie). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at indiscriminate pursuers, and Sheets (who currently has 34 incredible directorial titles) certainly does everything he can to please him, with spoils of spoils and blood thrown at every opportunity. But while these moments are undoubtedly disgusting, they are not particularly convincing, and soon they become quite tedious. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize, this is a really bad movie, with almost no redeeming features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First, it presents the best mullet in the history of cinema, as presented by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of his barnet (along with a big mustache) is the only reason to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it has 'pathetic stealthy zombies': corpses that eat meat and wait for the unfortunate victims to roam, before jumping out of hiding to launch a weak attack, which requires almost no effort to escape. Known to be hiding behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, "pathetic stealth zombies" also occasionally hide behind low walls, or sit in churches pretending to be members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally a film this bad would be 1/10 for me, but, in celebration of the locks that flow from Jerry Angell, I will generously raise my rating to 2/10.
