First of all, let me say that I am SUD or, rather, I am Mormon. So when I saw this movie, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. Usually, I can find something that redeems in every movie I see. And this was not the exception. It has its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me a lot was that it seemed that Halestorm was ashamed of our Church. In the LDS Church, the congregations are called "neighborhoods" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NEVER ONCE are any of these two names mentioned. The Church is never referred to by its name and "the norms" is as far as it is mentioned in what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> It makes me wonder if the directors are really aspiring to SUD or SUD. This movie had so much potential! It really could have shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was just a little entertaining and left a lot to be desired. If I were not yet on LDS, I would be left thinking that Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It is NOT a movie that I would recommend to my friends who are not LDS. <br /> <br /> Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!
