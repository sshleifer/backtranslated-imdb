I was angry that someone made this movie. I was even more angry, I lost valuable minutes of my life and I stood still to see this. I could have had a wax job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a bit confused, but then I realized and realized what was happening. By then, the movie was halfway there, and yes, I am a procrastinator, but I always want to see things through to the end. So I hung it up, I saw everything. Not only the actors are not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, but they are not convincing. I have seen my nephew ask for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust represented on the screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting look at this.
