I understand that Diehl's character is destined to be a microcosm of the same America: to see Arab terrorists under each rock, only to discover in the end that it is his own actions that put him in that state of siege and really of goodwill for all men, everything will be rainbows and palettes. I'm sorry, Wim. You have made amazing films in the past that remain neutral with respect to politics and, for good reason, the polemics are your weak point and weaken this well-made film, surprisingly filmed with absurd characters, dialogues and plots. Better luck in your next movie. Another thing that yanked my crank was the motley spot of the homeless section of Los Angeles that was there because of hunger, these people do not have enough to eat. Truly these people are not eating on a regular basis but the real hunger of these people is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, dignity that you can not give to a man. Yes, those people are hungry and if they need it, it is available. Except the center for hunger in the United States, I would say it is more the center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Deal with hunger, although a noble effort is to help a human problem of the homeless, deeper and systematically societal. However, Bill Diehl was good and Michelle Williams was cute as the young (clich√©) and old soul.
