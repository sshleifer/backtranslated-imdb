What begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat murky security monitoring company becomes, almost instantaneously, a murder mystery without interest and completely absurd. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are energetically trying to make this train collision visible, but some things are simply not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What makes Gale suddenly turn from a sweet mother figure into a drunken shrew in the house of Tommy's parents? Why is Heinrich, although it is true that he is a fanatic, wants to destroy the business to which he dedicates his life, stealing and possibly murdering his clients? Why does the seemingly sensible Tommy believe that Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were credible, why would not he go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when he got home, especially after scolding Howie for shutting down? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot to develop (and I use the term very, very freely). And it could be forgivable if it resulted in the slightest comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date of rape, to Gale's misidentification by the coroner, to the final "joke" that Gale and Howie are still dead, is more insipid and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I Check the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing more that I or anyone else can do to spoil this thing that already stinks of heaven.
