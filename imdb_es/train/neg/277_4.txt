The work of Lillian Hellman, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project to leave the aggressive Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, repeating his role on Broadway and winning the Oscar for Best Actor, plays a clandestine leader antinaazi German who fights against the fascists. , dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in the States (across the border with Mexico). They settle in Washington with the wealthy mother and brother of the wife, although a guest who resides in the mansion immediately suspects the new arrivals and spends a lot of time at the German embassy playing poker. This drama seems to take forever to find its focus, and when we realize what the core of the material is (the wise, honest and direct refugees teach Americans clueless and head on the sand how the world has suddenly changed) , it seems a little patronizing: the viewer is literally placed in the place of relatives, a lecture is given. Lukas has several speeches in the third act that, without a doubt, won him the Academy Award, but for the most part of the image it seems that not long ago, but he enters and leaves, he enters and leaves. Like his wife, Bette Davis enunciates like nobody else and works his big eyes with a good advantage, but paper does not allow much color. Her children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately comical and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has nothing to do with being a grumpy wife (and the texture of disgust she gives the part seems totally wrong). The intention here was to show us with good taste and tact just because a man (of the Second World War) can be German, that does not make him a sympathizer of the Nazis. We got it in the first minutes; The rest of this film of good taste and tact is composed of exposure, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a heady mix, but instead it's quite dry and inert. ** since ****
