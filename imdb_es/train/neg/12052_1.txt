What happens when you give a free man enough money to catch him in the rat race and watch him writhe? Homeless people do not respond to anyone. They do not have mortgages, rent payments or idiotic bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS, performance evaluations or credit card payments. But, give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, they have to worry about participating in the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying for their car insurance and working for someone else. They have the opportunity to be "productive citizens". This movie was as exploitative as a movie can be. It's a way for the rich and the middle class to say, "See what happens when you try to help the poor?" and vindicate capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie that asks: "What happens when you take away everything a rich man has?"
