First, I also expected another hero, a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, fascinating cinematography and a sincere performance (I mean, if you can not understand a word of what they say, without the subtitles, but still you It matters, it's a good performance. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What starts with political intrigue goes deep into a love story, Worse still, it's a love triangle like a soap opera. Basically, this film collapses after escaping from jail (I fell asleep for about forty minutes) It's almost as if writers have changed at that point The rest of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind." Ick Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the pieces of action.This is not exclusive to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action , and then, cua When the fight breaks out, it really was not so good. The principle catches you, but then this movie runs out of fuel.
