I was a little interested in this movie like a cannibal movie of poor quality. I was completely disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment that I felt when I saw "Friday the 13th: Jason takes Manhattan". So much wasted potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a decent attention grabber. then it stops. The copious breasts and the fashion of the 80s can not help this movie. The only things they eat near this island of cannibal monks are the piranhas! I'm not asking about the level of "cannibal holocaust" of blood, but I was looking for cheap and exploitative blood. I did not get any of that. <br /> <br /> I found a couple of parts of the intriguing fight scenes, hence the 2 stars. However, I do not think it's really worth the time it takes to look at it. I could see it at a party where nobody cares what is happening and you just want some background. but I would not tell anyone: "Oh, friend, you have to watch this movie." It is neither good enough nor bad enough to deserve much attention.
