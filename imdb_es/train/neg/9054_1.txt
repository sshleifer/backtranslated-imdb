If you hate Redneck accents, you will hate this movie. And to make matters worse, you see Patrick Swayze, he's been trying to be a redneck. I really can not stand the accents of paleto. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie get? The plot was stupid. I'm usually not that critical of movies, but I could not stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figures ... I think I'll close it and deliver it. to my grandmother for Christmas. It may be that he can not stand the accents of a redneck, or that he can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh once in the movie. I usually laugh at any stupidity. If they had shown me someone's fingers being crushed, I could have laughed. The fingers of people who break by accident always make me laugh.
