That is the only question I have left. Why did this movie stink so much when it had such a good cast? Why was the writing so bad that it left the audience completely disconnected from the characters? Why did not it make any sense at all? Why did the studio adopt a perfectly perfect premise and "Hollywood" came out of nowhere when all it needed was a good and intelligent storytelling? Why? I never understand why movies that start well turn into a bunch of trash when they're released. I hope for the sake of Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar's WINNERS, that this will never be published on the big screens of the United States. <br /> <br /> As someone who has a degree in journalism, the whole story is fair. completely laughable I just ... I think the script had potential, but the execution made it a clich√©, and a terrible one. Single. Do not.
