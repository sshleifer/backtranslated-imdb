I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought it was very good in American Gothic style) but, unfortunately, it did not have a very important role in this movie. It starts well and the rhythm advances very well ... but in the end it starts to be a bit tedious and boring. That does not mean that this is a boring movie, but it is very normal and nothing spectacular. I did not like the side of "possession" and there were no decent bloody scenes. Also, the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending does not make much sense. However, I liked the story surrounding the Gothic girl and the way she took revenge on her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans, it's nothing to get wet.
