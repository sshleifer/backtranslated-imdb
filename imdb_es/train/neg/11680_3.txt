This movie had a lot of potential: a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of those elements was lost. The story did not go anywhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a waste of very boring and useless film. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I am in the minority here and it should be a kind of phenomenon. However, I thought that this movie was terrible. I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very cocky kind of "fix" makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays, nice but nothing new.
