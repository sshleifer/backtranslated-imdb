... when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a script that was 'dated' in 34 and much less in 50. This sad movie has full scenes removed from the original with many of the supporting actors repeating their roles, unless they were dead. Although being older did not seem to matter to the Director. Neither does it seem that the cars and clothes of the 1934 backplanes did not match the standards of the 1950s. Not even the song 'der Bingel' can redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> We rate both the original and the IMDb Four Four Stars remake. Frank's touch was gone and all that remained was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra though. After rolling around in the 1950s making some educational documentaries, he ended his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Once again, an excellent cast was disillusioned in the effort of IMDb Six ****** Star also compared to the original Eight ******* Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop smoking when it was still ahead, just after the STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
