One of the lick wedding movies you'll see. Too much of your time period so you were out of date before you hit the theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a joke from Henny Youngman, except they are not funny at all here. Molly Ringwald, well, what else is there to say? It gives you a hint of stupidity, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "It's just not me" becomes this rag, with straps and a top hat, and they all smile kindly at her moxy, instead of Canceling his neck. It's also hell, take a look at how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
