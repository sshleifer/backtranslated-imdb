Even for the eighties of cocaine, this is pathetic. I do not understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and the brain cells of the audience to make that fool. If you're going to do a comedy, make it fun. If you want to film garbage like this, save it for you. If you're going to throw it as a joke like this: DO NOT do it !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Someone please tell me this was a joke. Please.
