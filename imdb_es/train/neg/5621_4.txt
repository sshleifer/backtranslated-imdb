I am an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and, therefore, I hoped to enjoy this movie. However, after seeing it, I sincerely believe that I could have made a better documentary myself. His arguments seem to have only four spurious sources (despite being listed in the credits in IMDb, I did not see Richard Dawkins anywhere), it is edited in a crude way with ridiculously amateur computer effects and does not make the slightest attempt. It seems impartial. The narrative is permeated at all times with a mocking anti-Christian feeling, almost adolescent, ruining any possibility that the film really changes someone's mind instead of just preaching to the choir (that is, to me). Although there is an interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film faces an unbearable obstacle when it begins to stop to a great extent in the Christian school that the director attended as a child, an institution that apparently marked him badly psychologically since obsesses him for this. day. <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make a smart comment about the highly questionable roots of Christianity. Certainly, there is a dearth of skeptical religious documentaries in the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end seems to be a kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he does not need to submit an audience to his coping mechanism.
