If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor management style embarrasses an already uninteresting and untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally incredible. It seems that all the action scenes were united freely by the poor plot points and the horrible acting. Keira Knightley gets totally naked in this, however. That is the only positive aspect of this movie. If you want to see her nude, quickly advance the film for an hour and a half and you will catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER! </ 3
