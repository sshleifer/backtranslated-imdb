The most horrible account of a great series. It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica, because it only has the same name. Too many changes just to have changes. You have characters that have gone from male to female, from black to Asian, to cylon, all in a way that "attracts female audiences", when there were already strong female characters that could have become stronger. The Egyptian feelings have gone. The search for the land is over. The lack of cylinders to go to the rejected terminators removes the film, especially when one makes a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese, but had many followers. They tried to hold onto the following, but they did not give the fans anything to work with, and they basically spat on their faces while they do "their own story." Changes are good, when they do something better, not just to make them.
