I had been following the progress of this movie for quite some time, so maybe I was expecting too much. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and I was interested in seeing what Dan Reed could do, but unfortunately it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand what genre it is falling into and, as such, fails to impress on the elements of drama, horror and suspense, because instead of focusing in one of them and doing it well, it's a bit crazy. All exchanges and no teacher. <br /> <br /> The premise (as in most revenge movies) is simple, couples get together and leave, something bad happens and revenge is a simple formula and one that many directors have handled in a way expert over the years. Unfortunately, in this case it is as if Dan Reed thought: "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that deepens a bit by showing a more human side to all the characters and deepening their mental state in more detail ... " Incorrect! Also missing some key elements, in this type of film there is usually some kind of warning. An element of not doing this or this could happen, which increases the tension, but here there is none of that. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There is a very tough competition in this genre and Dan Reed hats for trying it, I have no problem with his management skills, but in terms of writing ... I would say next time I should follow the formula for the type of movie you are making instead of being too smart and you will have a quality movie in your hands.
