For your own good, it would be better to ignore any positive criticism about this movie. This movie STINKS. Now, I like (at least in theory) low-budget horror films, but this one commits the worst mistake a low-budget movie can make: it takes itself too seriously. And, unfortunately, that is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It's the story of the Beane Clan killer of the British Isles transposed to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately disconcerting about this movie once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the biggest name in the CD box Jenna Jameson? She is a woman below average who can not act, and has a minor role. ANSWER: Apparently, she's a well-known porn star (as you've undoubtedly read in other reviews), so I guess it's a "cameo" to her. She is giving the film a much-needed "name recognition", it seems. However, his higher turnover is not an indication of his talent, but rather an indication of how disillusioned the rest of the cast is. <br /> <br /> # 2 How can filmmakers be stupid enough to think that Canada can be passed as Ireland? It does not even remotely resemble Ireland. And the house in which the guests / victims are housed is this great Edwardian wooden structure from North America. They should have omitted the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in NA. Also, if you're going to make a film that takes place in Ireland, it's probably better to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and that was an Irish accent REALLY REALLY BAD) Now, this would not have been so bad if the director was not trying to do the next "Night of the Living Dead", but it seems so, too much, I could have had a little fun with that, in fact, some of the scenes were not far from being involuntarily funny as they were. <br /> <br /> Like the infamous disembowelment scene, where the woman is chained to the table, naked, and then cut and cut eviscerated That's funny, you ask? Well, in the version of the deleted scene, the mutant killer retreats mile after mile after mile of intestines, it's really fun after a while, and what does the cannibal who eats the intestines respect, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat hams and ribs and stick Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Some of the other actors who were annoying: the tearful and creepy Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think it was supposed to be chosen as a STUDY. In fact, he is a big loser and imbecile, as his name implies. Which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on her IMDb link, and apparently it's important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a couple of years after graduation, the honor student is doing nude scenes of soft pornography in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Do you wonder if your former classmates have seen this movie? If they have done so, hopefully they will receive the message: AVOID THIS MOMENT! GOING TO COLLEGE!!! I could go on and on, but why. If you like gore, you will find something that redeems in this movie, but not much more.
