Imagine the gothic and gothic annoying children of college in a scat movie, throwing a dash of history and a lot of horrible performances, and you're not even close to how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> Shot Bad, bad effects, worse acting. Attempted horrific horror attempt. Everyone that I have shown this is depressed to see it. Sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily because of their content, but rather because they are something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is disgusting, even before she gets to the boy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who loves watching movies that people hate, that's why I chose this one. But for your own good, save your time and avoid this abhorrence. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
