This movie was excellent the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in translation". But, somehow, Bill Murray became an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson became an irritable Latina woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan became Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and the silence we enjoy in translation, we get meaningless talks on 10 elements that border on the nuisance. Instead of thoughtful and introspective characters as in Translation, we get characters that throw useless advice on topics they have no idea about. How can a character who wears one-hundred-dollar T-shirts and has never been inside a department store Target expect to advise a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that stops him. If he does not give you advice about his clothes, he is telling him what he should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was what was supposed to be in a hurry to make an appointment, and still the characters still find time to do another errand, either washing the car, stopping at Arby's or just lying on the list of your 10 items or less lists of things you love and hate. I kept wanting to shout at them saying, "Did not you say you had a place to be? What the hell are you doing? A minute ago you were almost late, now you're eating roast beef and thinking about your lives!" Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how something could "insist on itself", but I think this movie does exactly that, and without deserving it. The dialogue makes the characters corny and unfriendly, with the exception that I felt sorry for the two actors for signing this project.
