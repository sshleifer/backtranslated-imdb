I tried to sit through this pump not so long ago. What was a disaster The acting was atrocious. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell like a lead balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors simply did not sound true. Supposedly a new modern version of the original Hitchcock "Lifeboat". I think Hictcock would be circling in his grave just thinking about it. As far as I could bear, there's nothing convincing about this. movie.it has some semi large names, but they do not put any effort into their characters. But, you know, to be fair, it was not really anyone's fault. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script exploded in the first explosion. . LOL. It is possible that this thing ends up improving as it progresses. But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out. Therefore, unless you have at least one weekend of three days on the horizon, avoid this stench / 1/10
