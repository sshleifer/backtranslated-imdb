Now, I am someone who sees movies that have bad reviews and says: "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy, and I thought My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind that I did not really start to see this with much hope, but I thought maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at that. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering through this "movie" (and I use that term sparingly) was it even close to being slightly entertaining. For starters, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I can tell, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than him. The main character is simply annoying, and is not a character that is easy to like. Frankly, I would rather eat a greasy piece of the bloody sores of a harlequin fetus than look at this again.
