The film and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante, but the film forgets what is supposed to be a prequel to a successful movie. The creators of this prequel clearly did not see the original Carlito Way or at least did not worry about continuity. This movie is a prequel, which means that the original film has already presented some history for us and this film must end where the original begins or, at least, lead to it. Not one of Carlito's old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzm√°n, Pachanga in the original, is in the film, but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering that this movie takes place less than 5 years ago, do not you think that one of Carlito's friends would appear? In the original, Carlito began to leave prison after spending 5 years in prison. That's only a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this happy ending of Hollywood, it is an insult to the intelligence of the fans of the original. What's wrong with Gail? It is the lack of continuity that made this film direct to the release of the video.
