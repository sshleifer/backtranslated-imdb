In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the film achieves its goal: to be seen by thousands. But it does not make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the theme was an original way to consider time travel: forget about the return to the future of Zemeckis, here comes the old France, the gentleman of the Middle Ages and his almost barbaric way of life. Full of pride, amused by the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> No one had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's no use being a film expert to realize that the Time Runners have been made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with some time. paradox that would have needed some second reflection. Explanation: it is no use trying to recover the jewelry that Jacquouille has stolen; Do not you remember this beautiful and bright red car that you bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​the jewels ... And that's just one of the many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde ... that's another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to commit to this sequel to avoid getting caught up in the role of the bourgeoisie. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful that I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that a cast of comedians is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget time travel, digital effects, focus on the story and you will see that there is enough space on a postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A film for young people, let's say until the age of 13.
