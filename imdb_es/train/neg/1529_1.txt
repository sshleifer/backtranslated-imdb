If you see this turkey in your TV guide, EVELVE IT LIKE THE PLAGUE! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡Start to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the memory draft scene) but even that only qualifies .001 on the risometer (of 1000). Whoever wrote this turkey should be forbidden to write another movie for his entire life.
