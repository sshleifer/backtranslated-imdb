They screwed up this story! In the end, Nell is heroic and faces the team to save all her backs from Hill House and a lot of nonsense like that! They added severed heads, cables cutting people's faces and the roof became a giant hand! What the hell is that? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so cool is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no roof hand. It is only in the ghost announcement that ghosts can really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us around the room or throw a knife in our head. No. They can only drive us crazy. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for her. Yes, he cared a little for others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have fucked up in this great story! I hate this damn remake!
