Woohoo! Only such a ridiculously horrible movie could inspire similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? The undesirably horrible subject? The non expressions of Pia Zadora throughout the film? The fact that, despite being located in Los Angeles, also known as "the land of the cast iron couch," EVERY single man (and woman!) Is coaxing himself to sleep with Pia Zadora, by any suitable means necessary? Or what about the fact that all the people in the film are totally unfriendly because they are narcotic (Pia) or are obvious and despicable of sleazeball (everyone else)? And since this movie was written by real screenwriters ("sorta"), it shows a surprising lack of understanding of the film industry (who the hell would a WRITER admire and kiss?) <br /> <br /> But it's (without intention) fun as hell. The "breakdown" scene will only make you laugh, and after seeing the weather "I'm not the only one who had to go to the top scene" "Awards" (all done at the usual level of performance in the negotiation basement that we expect of quality artists like Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia really has reused that speech when she "won" her Golden Globe. It is appropriate and that makes my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you are a fan of bad and dirty camps, give this movie otherwise bad taste.
