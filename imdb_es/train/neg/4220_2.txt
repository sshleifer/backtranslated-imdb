A brief review but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a complete waste of 90mins. By the end of the movie, I had no idea what had really happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it just does not make any sense. Whether the story has been lost in the edition, not now, but heavens ... <br /> <br /> Instead, put a DVD or go to bed and rest a bit! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and a Morris Minor car chase) <br /> <br />
