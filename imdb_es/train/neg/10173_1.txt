No wonder the majority of the cast wished they had made this movie. It's just ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. The bad actors read cheesy lines, while the bright and classic exhibition cars continually revolve around a restaurant that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. The students fight handfuls with the deranged director as he tries to prevent them from setting fire to a bronze statue of the civil war. The Watts riots with a cast of ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to vomit while looking like Mary Hartman with the most annoying smile since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan's lyrics to the evil teacher with a swing indicator and a very bad facelift. The drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits on a rocket for children on his last night before entering the service. The silly, laughing schoolgirls dress in stretchy leopard pants and walk on the set of 'Shindig', they sing horribly out of tune and really make it big in the music business. And who wrote this convincing dialogue ?: "I'm going to Burkley and I have flowers in my hair" ... "I think I found someone to buy Woody from Stick!" ... "These people are 'animals'!" "These people are my 'family'!" While the Shirelles sing "Mama Said." Oh, brother, what a mess This is like a 'Reefer Madness' of the years 60, except it's not even funny.
