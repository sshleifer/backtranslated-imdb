Shazbot, this is shameful. In fact, here is a list of 100 that compensates for the embarrassment: 1.) a failed return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically plays the same role he played in the 101 Dalmatians remake live that it was not very juicy to start with. Sure you have a fun way to promote your Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney what Jet Li was for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian of the television series, played a small part (read "cameo") in this film and died two years after lupus. Coincidence? 6.) Terrible special effects. Seriously - horrible 7.-100.) That damn talk, the fart costume expressed in an annoying degree by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? SAY AH! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Good! ... Good. You - you're a joker. Well, we wrap this review with a moment of silence for the dying death of this franchise, and if you wish, you can say a quick prayer so that Disney does not forget this parody and do something silly like a film adaptation of "Mork and Mindy" starring by Tim Allen ............................................. .. ..........
