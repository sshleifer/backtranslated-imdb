The mere thoughts of "Going overboard" (also known as "Babes Ahoy") makes me want to cry. Throwing yourself out the window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed "so bad is good" movie. I would spend money to buy copies of this film and burn them so that people can not see them. Oh the pain, the pain ...
