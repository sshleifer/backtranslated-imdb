Jeff Lowell has written and directed 'Over Her Dead Body' badly. The idea is, first of all, as much as my jokes and the execution is just a piece of cake. <br /> <br /> Without Eva Longoria Parker, there's almost nothing appealing in this movie. Eva looks good as always and offers a pleasant performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks tired and less interested. Lake Bell is a complete disaster. She looks masculine and offers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, as is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I did not entertain myself.
