When I got this free movie from my work, along with three other similar movies ... I saw then with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad by itself. You have what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a blockbuster Hollywood, but for cheap thrills is not so bad. I would probably never see this movie again. In short, this is the kind of movie you would see very late at night on a local television station that just wants to take some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon at a local television station that is trying to take some time . Despite the bad performance, clich√© lines, and sub par camera work. I did not have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend that it never appeared on my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many movies. This is not different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Only your average movie.
