Well, what can be said about this disaster? I saw it because it was transmitted by cable. I'm sorry I lost my time but at least I did not waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the one that can get the most cheese! Please, you must be very generous not to get mad at the Halloween costume. Oh, well, there are also horrible acting demonstrations, f / x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can not get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from direct movies to video ones. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, please. The only "positive" of this garbage are the sexy women.
