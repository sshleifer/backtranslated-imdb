This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, among more than 100 French films I've seen. Terrible script and very mediocre / unprofessional acting makes the leadership impotent. With everything that matters, it does not matter how nice the western French scene and the elegant music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these two characters DO NOT attract people, as the audience does not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how this film won the jury prize in Cannes, man, I love almost all the films awarded in Cannes, but it is not. A big disappointment to me.
