This is the worst piece of trash brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, dumb and useless I've seen, an incredible garbage of instant cult status among fans of the weird. If you think that Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you that it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that. Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's more than bad, really. But if you're looking for that kind of incredible movie, it's for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror films, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some incredible things, but with "Star Creatures" they descend to level Z. Of course, my 1 in 10 works the other way if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy who plays an Indian boss is great), so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
