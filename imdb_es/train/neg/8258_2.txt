I was lucky enough to read the book before watching the movie. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream of missing summers, a great independent film or a big budget drama. Somehow, it came to the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without really learning anything at all. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low eyebrow gags. I'm sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but reduced to shameful features in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story is presented as a special evil after school. Poor people = GOOD, rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it's almost worth looking to see the southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer that is meant to go through a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but a shameful turn for the first director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
