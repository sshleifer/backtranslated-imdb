"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. They told me it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was badly bent or the soundtrack was not good with the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty bad. It was thought very little in the English version of this film and appeals only to the genre of "action without meaning". It is not a movie that I would like to see again.
