Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon cinematic madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The movie is poor, even by typical Lampoon standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one is going to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Then, when I finished watching it, I started to wonder why the hell it's called 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies', and why it was conceived, much less actually done. It would be like calling Austin Powers 'An American boy goes to the movies'. That shameful. He is not American, and he does not go to the movies. None of the characters in the so-called 'satire' of Lampoon is funny, and none see movies, which causes a small problem. I expected it to be something like Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon movie after Animal House, although you could not tell from the quality. of the movie. Little developed, rude and amateur by any standard, induces headaches? It's not a good signal for an 89-minute movie that seems to double in length. <br /> <br /> I have noticed a pattern. Are really really bad movies renamed? and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles, probably to help try to promote it among people who are too stupid to remember how bad it was from critics of home video in 1982/83. 'Hmm, Movie Madness ?? I've never heard of this movie! Let's rent it! And then, he realized: 'Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!' <br /> <br /> It was archived by MGM / UA, to never be released to theaters or DVDs; Occasionally he appears on television a few times a decade, which is almost the only place where you can find him. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three stories? a parody of videos of self-enlargement, butter and corporate cruelty, and police brutality / movies of fellow police (I suppose). The first segment is played by Peter Riegert (House of Animals) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does other things. I'm not sure what, because it was so boring, my mind began to wander. Until the sex scene appeared. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a piece of butter (do not ask) who decides to become Queen of Margarine in order to cut off the supply of dairy products. Oh! This contains the only funny phrase from the movie: "Only I can make love with my son!" If you think that does not sound very funny, are you right? It is not. And just imagine? It is the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a policeman chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose courage and shoot the guy. Does it contain a funny scene but is extremely exaggerated? Only Lloyd really shows humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, but strangely surreal. The part where he is suffocating his victim and the docile policeman is watching how everything develops, at least evokes a giggle or two. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to see a cast of semi-famous names resorting to low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they are being very ironic and intelligent in simulating the so-called stereotypes. the flaw is that the film becomes a great contradiction, favoring the standard of T & A instead of the plot; raw humor instead of witty dialogue; Desperate actions instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors were enthusiastic about the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed that they rarely can make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, like I said. before. I laughed once, in a single line, and even then it was a half-hearted one. Two giggles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, several other decent comedies look like regular laugh tracks. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoon holiday series (or at least three out of four installments), and its classic Animal House, but its a recent series of direct video bombs, like Golf Punks ( with that great comic genius Tom Arnold), is a good example of why his magazine sold out more than a decade ago. It becomes very old, very fast. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see a new movie, called Gold Diggers, which opens with its 'seal of approval'. It's like condemning a movie before it even hits the theaters. Maybe you should start not to advertise your name everywhere? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. Obtains the stamp of approval National Lampoon. That will teach you not to do something so horrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty. Just place a group of criminals in a room and have them see this again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain his vile rot. I give up.
