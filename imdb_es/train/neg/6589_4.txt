I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. Apart from some saving graces, it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> J-horror has had a great boom for the past five to six years, but the films themselves have been repetitive in more than one account and have been copies of a previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with chilling scenes of a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes sewn graphically, but shortly after opens them. However, after that, it is very fast for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be nice, I will start with the things I like about "Gawi". On the positive side, the images are striking and the film looks great for your type. For those who like their bloody horror films, there are some well-executed murder scenes (no pun intended). We also have some good sequences / suspense sets. <br /> <br /> However, there are also some drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my main complaint about This movie, is that the plot jumps and jumps back and forth in time with an alarming intensity. Usually, that's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same, no matter how old they are, I got confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine, I suppose (a bit difficult to say when you do not know the language), but it seems a bit stiff. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was scary enough. I got bored for a while. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Giallo's films, I expected a lot from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
