You have to give it to Steven Seagal: whatever his other faults, he has good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, it is likely that there are one or more very beautiful women in it. And usually, they do not work as mere candies for the eyes; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with delicious lips to combine with Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to involve them both in a catfight and in a small lesbian caress! And if it seems I'm spending too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although it's passable, is so uninteresting that it's hard to find much more to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who does not seem to even bother trying to pretend he cares. Because it is a kind of military action, there are very few fights in him, and he does not fit into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which can explain his almost sleepwalking offensive.
