The 1963 version of "The Haunting" has been one of my favorite horror films for years, so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with some concern. It hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or even match the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my worries were well founded: this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the people involved in this movie thought. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have had a chance when he directed the excellent "Speed", behaves as badly here (or maybe worse) as he did with the very popular "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control". "Hey Jan, stick to filmmaking, would you?" Liam Neeson is right in his role as a psychologist who pretends to have a dream in the dream, I do not think he's capable of really bad performance, but even he can not save a dream. lazy screenplay weak story Catherine Zeta Jones demonstrates once again (as she did in "Atrapment") that she lacks the ability to act to rise above the material that is handed to her, the female protagonist, who did it very well in a episode of "The X-Files", seems to be lost here as Eleanor, an insomniac that hangs on the edge of sanity, and that blond guy, whoever he is, is more of wood than the figurines of ridiculously strange children carved in the wood around the house, I do not think I'll change my expression once during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS ADEAD) <br /> <br /> The reason why the first movie worked so good is because we were never sure if the house is She was truly delighted or if the demonstrations were the result of Eleanor's precarious state of mind. In reality, no spirits are seen in the original, leaving much to the imagination, a hallmark of other great horror films such as "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project." In this updated version, of course, we get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically (in the face of the weak script / argument) make the film totally irreversible. The f / x are not so good, considering that they were made by ILM. The icy breath seems particularly false. The effects on Peter Jackson's underestimated film "The Frighteners", which I saw right before this, were much better. The children's wood carvings, which are supposed to look spooky, look ridiculous (especially when they scream), and the CGI monsters are nothing out of this world. Instead of providing relief for bad acting, bad direction and bad writing, the effects only add to this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly silly scenes: when the other three characters enter Eleanor's bedroom, and none of them seems at all surprised to find a huge, frowning demon looming over the bed. The scene where Eleanor "sees" the ex-lady of the house hanging from the beams ... the performance here is particularly bad. And last but not least, the little hilarious nonsense in which Wooden Blond Guy throws a little inspired cry of what is supposed to be anguish, jumps on a piece of furniture and begins to cut the paint of the old and evil boy who built home. In fact, we feel satisfied in this scene, and seconds after his attack, Blond Guy is dragged to the fireplace by the old man's ghost and quickly cuts his head off with the fireplace. It was the only part of the movie that I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> In short, stick to the 1963 original "The Haunting." 3/10 stars.
