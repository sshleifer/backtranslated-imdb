The fact that someone is under 10 does not mean that it is stupid. If your child likes this movie, it is better to try it out. I am continually surprised at how many people can get involved in something that is so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital magic and nothing more. The writing is horrible. I do not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are beyond miserable. The performance is below average, but the actors were not given much. Who decided to employ Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly like sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is the obvious of everything. It is as if the writers did everything possible to make everything as stupid as possible. The great films for children are perverse, intelligent and full of wit: films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches, to mention two from the past. However, in the continuing disturbance of Americans, there are more people flocking in like "Finding Nemo" (yes, that's right), the recent "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" and the garbage that crosses the eyes like " Red Riding Hood ".
