There is a reason why this went straight to the video: the story is monotonous, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sordid way: sex in the churches and other scenes bordering the insipid (like the scene in the laundry) stain this movie . Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is fine, but the film itself with its themes of degradation and revenge is not well made. But it's a good movie for trivia contests, because very few people saw it.
