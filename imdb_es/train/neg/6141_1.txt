One night, I was waiting for my friends to return to the apartment and "Gymkata" was on; I have seen too much of that. In fact, it's hilarious and horrifying, really. Think of it this way: if in your work you had an idea for something so bad and executed it in a terrible way like this, how long would it last? Not as long as this movie. It is a must see, obviously.
