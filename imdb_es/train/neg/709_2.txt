This film was so badly written, directed and acted that it breeds belief. It must be redone with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is acting. You have Jennifer Beals, on the one hand, polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is terribly misinformed and simply discusses this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are as bad as the slaves who own (and maintain) the couple, although both usually do a good job. The actors (and the director) should not have tried to do accents at all, they are inconsistent and incredible. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in real English. The casting is ridiculous. Why the children of an "African" merchant (therefore, less socially desirable for the society of gens de couleur) have been chosen with actors of very pale skin, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel has pronounced African traits, including a blond "obviously dyed"? It's as if the casting directors do not mind reading the script they are broadcasting and choosing the right actors from a large group of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's so weird! This could be a great movie and should be done again, but with people who respect the material and can choose suitable and trained actors. There are many good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, a good script and a good direction.
