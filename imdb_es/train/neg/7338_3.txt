I have been watching this movie with the hope of finding a beautiful and interesting story, but the story was not good at all. The acting of the actors was not better. <br /> <br /> Of course Shahrukh Khan was there, but it was not enough to make this film "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I have read that this movie was based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary", but for me I did not see it coinciding with the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy movies to dream and have a good time, so as not to waste our time and change our mood to worse. I just can not understand how you can get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So it's the kind of movie you should run away from and ignore because there's nothing to appreciate. in that! You will simply waste your time unless you like "dark film" with "strange and meaningless story".
