I decided to watch this series after watching the endless BBC ads in the weeks before it began. I saw it despite the fact that I do not like the pretentious things Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans, but I think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with the work of this author). I admit that the performance is excellent, it is beautifully filmed and I entertained myself reasonably with it, however, I found that the story was extremely thin and after seeing the three episodes I feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The 'explicit' gay sex about which the media referred to has been done before on television, several times, so it was nothing too surprising, I'm afraid. Total score for production values ​​but low for argument / content. I'm afraid.
