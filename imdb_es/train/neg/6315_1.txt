This elegant and sexy movie is a must see. Only in multiple presentations can you truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally I enjoy the narrator for his style of intelligent narration, without themes that have not been touched. The introduction catches you right away and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. It provides a wonderful insight into the world of personal objects and allows the audience to really "connect" with the internal horror that this film exhibits. The script itself holds the film beautifully. Not only for children, but also for older adults who will gain a better understanding of personal objects and the modern understanding they have about the sexual experience. Advanced to his time and revolutionary in cinematography, surely defines the word "masterpiece".
