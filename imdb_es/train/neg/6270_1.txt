Somehow, a woman who works with a scientist puts round metal balls in the mouths of people who supposedly change their personality, but actually turns them into crazed and zombie-like assassins. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are young women with little clothes and nubiles who desperately need acting classes. This movie is horrible, atrocious and incredibly bad. It has little or no logic in the script. You will really have trouble following what is happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen that supposedly represents a scientific breakthrough is not seen more than an old Atari screen. And what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair (it looks like a lonely child in summer camp) named George, who is like a servant / personal confidante of Jessica (the "leading actress"). Throughout the film, you will be subjected to the idiotic and sophisticated expressions of this puppet. But wait ... you also get lots of softcore scenes, little erotic, barely nude with the girls with some guys from the bar. Meanwhile, a more annoying soundtrack plays in the background as if some kind of spiritual discovery had occurred. None of the actors is good. There are only several degrees of evil. The gore and "horror" aspects are especially filmed inept. The movie really looks like an armed teenager. It is no coincidence that Henry Sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. I got bored almost in a coma when I saw this stupid and silly dreck! And how about the end? What happened? If you know, let me enter the secret because I can not understand it for my life. All I know is that I lost the time I spent watching this crap that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare!
