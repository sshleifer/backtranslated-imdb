I will not add comments to the plot, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> Very improbable orphanage in Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at its peak. <br /> <br /> A beautiful landscape. <br /> <br /> Good to stain the face, and I quote, "look at the mouth, which is Cassie de Fools and Horses". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> Redeeming the function? It was free to watch on the Horror channel before moving on to subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
