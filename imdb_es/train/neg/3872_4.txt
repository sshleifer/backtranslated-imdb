The movie never becomes intolerable to watch. And to say it clearly, he has nothing to show either, except maybe the sexy Alicia Silverstone in a non-sexy nerd character by revealing pretty sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow, you can see it in any way. There is no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring places and a very smooth performance. Kevin Dillon is totally useless. Silverstone ... well, I did not concentrate too much on his performance, I confess. However, as I said before, if one has nothing to do except watch a movie, this will not look so bad. 4/10
