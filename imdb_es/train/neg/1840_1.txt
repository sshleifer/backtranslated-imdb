This has to be the most brutally ungraceful "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazed drifter CAN NOT make me laugh? Something has to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've wanted to leave. I used free passes, and I still felt like I wanted my money back. I can say with all my heart that the only movie I've seen worse than this was THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worst. movie. I laughed a bit about the merry-go-round scene, and that's it. Spending 2 hours on something advertised as a comedy should make you laugh more than a laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought that "flan" was a funny word, or something like that. And the other joke that really runs is to beat a dead horse, literally.
