Unlike the other two programs of current games of endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the rhythm of this program is too slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pace because the games can change rhythm, or finish, at any time. There is a risk involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are very variable and it is difficult for the players to come out with a significant amount of money. Suspense is generally used well. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is too slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would be helpful if the rhythm of this program reveals the correct answer FIRST, and THEN make the player select a dancer, instead of wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an incorrect answer when we all know they are right . . Random dancing is a filling that actually feels like a filling. A lot of time is wasted while not enough happens ... and the fact that players can not leave the game prematurely guarantees that there will be a lot of lost time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and NO. Interest in seeing Shat shaking his pace, especially after having dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the programs of games of the whole life, but I even had many problems when spending an hour of this. Either you need major changes or early retirement.
