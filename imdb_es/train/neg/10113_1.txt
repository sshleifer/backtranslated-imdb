I discovered that this movie is rented according to the package. The zombie on the front of the DVD looks great and scary. Then you get to the movie and they are women with raccoon masks. Zero special effects ... and even the fight scenes you can see, missing 2-foot hits. The funny thing is that Lommel acts briefly in the film and is worse than the rest of the actors in the film. The only thing I can think is that Lommel is trying to make a film so bad that people consider it a "cult classic" ... however, I can not imagine anyone thinking that this is anything other than one of the worst movies of history. fact. The real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I am ashamed to have rented it and I promise never to see another Lommel movie.
