He caught this by accident on a t.v. showing, and I could hardly believe how terrible the whole experience was. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was fascinating because it maintained one's interest in everything. But this nonsense - the words fail me. It was bad enough to have a kind of "story" presented with the full impact of a wet loaf of bread, but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles everywhere when the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For God's sake, could not the filmmakers find enough American Indians who were also actors and almost actors to act as "Indians" in this farrago instead of the impostors they actually used? I also found it rather shameful to see Richard Harris having fun all over the field at the obvious instance of the director standing behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from point A pointless to point B nonsense just to retrieve the images from the film and the minutes. Absolutely terrible in every respect!
