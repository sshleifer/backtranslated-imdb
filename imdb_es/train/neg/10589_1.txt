Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, that honor would have to go to a movie that tried to make some kind of statement or achieve some artistic feat, but it failed in a pathetic or offensive way. However, perhaps no film I have seen has tried so little and has been as successful as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a science fiction / action parody that has virtually nothing to recommend. The acting is as bad as any movie I've seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who is remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed of himself. US: The Return makes the former Van Damme fare look like an innovative cinematic masterpiece. Some movies are so bad, they're good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say here. I doubt that many people were considering watching this movie if they had not already done so, but just in case: no.
