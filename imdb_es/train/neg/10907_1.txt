I expected a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this failure seemed to last forever. It is one of those movies that enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while it is not appropriate for children. The jokes are not only jokes of low or high, they are rude, lascivious, and many acts cross borders not only in bad taste but beyond the moral and legal decency. Many scenes seem to have been cut to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could have been a big buzz like an R-rated movie if it had been left funny. (Exaggeration? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It's a total waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and I'm ready to give anything. At 45 minutes, the movie seemed like it should be ending ... and we were ready for that. The end is picturesque, but it does not rescue the rest of this tiger / tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (I'm glad you saw it as a freebie ... you would have fallen sick of paying greenbacks earned by this gut)
