I saw a mask in the 80s and is currently shown at Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember that I thought it was a bit cold in the day and I also had a couple of toys, but seeing it now bores me to tears. Never before had I realized how tedious and bland this cartoon show was. It's just horrible! It is not as close in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and almost everyone forgot it quickly once it stopped being done. I only see it in Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 appears immediately afterwards (that's if the mask does not put me to sleep first). One of the lesser cartoons of the 80s that I hope to forget completely once it finishes broadcasting on Fox Kids!
