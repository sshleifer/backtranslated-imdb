Things I learned from "The List". <br /> <br /> A decent cinematographer, a sexy girl who can act and Malcolm McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won 'I do not give you back your money. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?", Malcolm McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting lessons. <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punishes me by making me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie. <br /> <br /> When making a movie, you do not need an ending. Just leave everything unexplained, unresolved, interesting enough for the audience to fall asleep BEFORE the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random owner can cure death by just drawing a cross in a window. So make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can bring you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs acting classes. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> No apologies will be accepted.
