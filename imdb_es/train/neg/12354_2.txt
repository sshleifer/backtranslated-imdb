Naturally, I did not see 'GI Jane' out of choice. More or less I was forced to watch this movie at my ex-girlfriend's house. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses her credibility immediately by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course is not. The result of this is that the story is automatically bound by restrictions, restricting the amount of humor (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. Therefore, the film becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails when other action films are successful, mainly because films like James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, but they never claim to be otherwise. They are escapism , and therefore entertained. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie by Ridley Scott, with a very little credible plot, a not at all remarkable performance, and the only reason why I give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work.
