A well-organized entry in the serial killer genre that, unfortunately, is plunged into its own claim to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is an excellent detective from New York who tries to trace what appears to be an impersonator who uses the same techniques of killing related to Renaissance art used in a series of murders he solved years before. Scott Speedman is the junior partner of Dafoe and they have good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to conveniently join the two cases. Clea Duval is the friend of a previous victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of art agent / mentor to Dafoe ... that's a bit difficult to take, although Stormare, of course, is never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Quickly watch Deborah Harry as Dafoe's less than close neighbor.
