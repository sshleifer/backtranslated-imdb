After going through the movie store to find something to watch, we came across this. It seemed attractive by the summary, at least, so we tried. And here's the trick: the first 20 minutes are interesting! Is really nice! Oh, wait, he spoke too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in there, the film took an unpleasant turn to a fundamental, right-wing Christian brainwashing. I'm not completely sure of what happens, but I think the scriptwriter found God somewhere there, he finished writing this script and did not have time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting to meet with his friends from the Westboro Church and his hood was not clean. <br /> <br /> Can you put warnings about this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just as video games have classification systems, movies need some kind of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to get worse. <br /> <br /> Unless you share the feelings with the imbecile who came up with this story, and they will have their Bible open in their lap as they watch this and plan how they will convert their neighbors, do not waste your time. It is one of the worst waste that has come out in a long time, and the radical religious fools no longer need more funds.
