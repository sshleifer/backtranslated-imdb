Here is a movie with a good cast and a good location job, but it does not. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better was his THE PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during non-slow camera scenes. This movie needed to be accelerated, in any case. That foam of horses seemed to me tremendously false and the obvious traces of the tires in those moments of crawling in the desert ... just lazy. sloppy work. Too. The actors did it well, but I've certainly seen everyone do better. However, Ben Johnson is always a joy. The first time I saw this movie was almost 30 years ago; I was disappointed then and stayed that way on the second visit 30 years later.
