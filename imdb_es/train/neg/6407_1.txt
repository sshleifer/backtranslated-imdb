I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. That is a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously speaking, this movie is living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need repair. A street hero but vulnerable, a former master of martial arts former policeman with a heart of gold and a serial killer with "problems." Pure magic.
