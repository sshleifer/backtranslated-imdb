This movie was extremely boring. It should not less than 15 minutes. The images of children and animals that were killed were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not write comments, but this was so bad with so many good and excellent comments. I think that in this case we are one step closer to an honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from 8 hours of sleep. I think it is the point itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters, except perhaps 2 sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep once you see it, do not try to back off and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
