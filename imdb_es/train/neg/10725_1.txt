As much as I do not like to say "me too" in response to other comments, it is completely true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with the endless feeling that comprises the next 90. <br /> <br /> Being banned somewhere does not allow you to watch a movie. The fact that it does not look like a Hollywood product does not make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse, in addition to a non-perceptible plot (other than that there are many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old, drink a lot of vodka) a series of images are so unnecessarily nauseating that I am in my second pack of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers, well, the movie is so devoid of any narrative thread. I could not write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or your money, and do not confuse this with good Russian cinema.
