This story is about the romantic triangle between a n. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waitress who does not speak French and seems never to shave. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is boring, sad and depressing, be it with fog, covered winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was out. All are pale and dejected and look emaciated, in poor condition and dirty. The bodies are bony and are shot in a close-up that look pretty ugly and unattractive. Polka dots, greasy hair. Yuk Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. The three characters return to Stephanie's hometown, where, through a lot of flashbacks of the desolate countryside and the supposedly dirty interiors, we see a little of Stephanie's childhood when she was a boy named Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and that's it, seriously. Character development is kept to a minimum, as is the outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I guess the story is not linear (it would explain to many nonsecuiteurs) but in reality, after paying my seven euros, I do not feel like having to build the film myself: that's what the Director takes my money to Wait for me to join the process of telling stories and getting my hands dirty, so to speak, is asking too much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bunch of pretentious garbage made, above all, from a desire of Epater les bourgeois (that is, I hit the straights). I can see how it was a failure for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it did not get anywhere.
