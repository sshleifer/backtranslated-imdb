I agree that although this Melville story may be impossible to filter, this is not a credible attempt. To translate history into the twentieth century, it only outrages the intention and nature of the original story; possibly you could have moved it to England, but it must be a period piece. Even our storyteller, the owner, tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without thinking. And the twentieth century? Come on! Give me a broken break! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work very well, considering the end. And the end of the movie? I do not know what it was, because I did not see the whole farce, I had to stop. This was like putting "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
