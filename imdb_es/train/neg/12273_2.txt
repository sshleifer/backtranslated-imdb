PLAN B has the appearance of a sloppy script, edited and quickly edited for a movie with the intent of an exit for the actors involved, an exit that should have been excluded from the beginning. It's just another 'comedy' based on the mafia that has nothing new and lowers the standard for the participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned with clothes and appearances than his control business. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is more stupid than dirty and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni has beaten one of his debtors (who is married to Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran as his assistant to get rid of the debt of her dead husband being the "hitman of Maloni". Fran fears her own shadow and can not carry out Maloni's tasks, and instead chooses to transport her "whackees" to Florida to hide in the house of her brother James until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A is to kill them! The ending is totally predictable, just like every line assigned in the script to the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many excellent films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams. and skinned and twisted through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to see. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino-type cast of other mafia movies. The supporting cast is also allowed to play on the balcony in the simplest way imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being simply foolish and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to return to television comedies: if this flimsy story had been compressed into a half-hour concert, he might have had a chance. Harp grady
