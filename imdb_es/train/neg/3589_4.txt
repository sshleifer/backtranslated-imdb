I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the list of actors, but after seeing it I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem with this film is that the actors are not able to hold this film on their backs. Why? Due to bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones go to great lengths to take this film to another level, there is no innovative narrative and direction is too common. So for fans of Matt Dillon, this is a movie that can be seen, as well as for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a movie for him; well below your level. So if you hooked up with this great cast, look at it but do not expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing he will remember about this movie are the scenes of Diane Lane; The rest is very forgettable.
