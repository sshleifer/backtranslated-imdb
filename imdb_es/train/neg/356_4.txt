The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, setbacks and emotions. Sometimes, this is really a movie "on the edge of the seat". But it disappoints, and severely disappoints. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is not credible; Your character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but I will only say that the character we met at the beginning could not be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second big disappointment of the movie is that - finally, it becomes little more than a bloody Slasher movie. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the films of "Friday the 13th." It's not that each film has to always be in good taste, but this film drips blood at times. <br /> <br /> Although the movie features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not live up to his usual standards, and often seems to be walking through the steps.
