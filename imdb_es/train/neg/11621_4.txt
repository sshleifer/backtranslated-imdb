I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian. The director had a good idea / intentions in making this film, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for those who believe that it is the best love of their life. However, he did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character continued to apologize to his friends when they were the ones that meant to him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behaviors. The main character, and nobody else did not know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, was still married, etc., but they were against him resolving old feelings that should be treated. His friends were supposed to be Christians and they should have been portrayed as supportive, whether they agreed with his decision or not. Many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this, everyone was against him. The ironic part was that her new friend accused him of having a stalking behavior by simply looking for an old friend, when she did something really strange to get her name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be the stalker. ! She did not seem to be a friend at all, she was just taking care of herself. God is love ... and I believe that God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and I feel that the film committed a terrible injustice by making it seem that God does not care about true love ... just that you stay with someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps you take to make amends. As I said, the movie had potential, but I was tired of the one-sided view being constantly repeated and getting stuck in the spectators' throats by its so-called ... well-intentioned friends. This movie did not stay true to the Christian belief of love, but I give it a C for its effort.
