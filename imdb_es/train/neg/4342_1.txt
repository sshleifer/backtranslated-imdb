I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. They had a pretty good story to continue, but it messed up so badly. First of all, the whole cast is wrong, where did Van Peeble (fucking actor by the way) and Daddy Blow? It seems that Carlito has come out of the hood, and he used to hang around with some real idiots. This movie does not do justice to "Carlitos Way". I am so happy that the sequel "Carlito's Way" came out first, if I had seen this crap first, I would never have given Pacino's version a chance. And anyway, Pacino is supposed to read this story, thought it was crap and instead made the sequel. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 of 10.
