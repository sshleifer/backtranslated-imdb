Even with a cast that features such reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give any sense of depth to this film. It barely scratches the surface of the incidents that occurred on that July night in 1981. Kilmer simply performs the moves, since John Holmes, Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are, hopefully, grumpy in the other two leading roles; as the wife of Holmes and his underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has roles so small that it is impossible to get any dimension from them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo by Paris Hilton.
