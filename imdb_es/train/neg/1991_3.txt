So, what's the big fuss about doing an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who's chosen as a fictional type of adventure story book who does not want to go out on an adventure? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for some reason, this movie lacks emotion. That does not mean you have no action, but look at the dark side of the image. This has nothing to do with INDIANA JONES or other action and adventure emotions that contain suspensions and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED was promoted in that way using clever propaganda for me and many others to interest us! Also, I've never heard of the guy, so who needs your attention?
