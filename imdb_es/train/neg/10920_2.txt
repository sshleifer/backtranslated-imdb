This must have been one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator, who said the special effects were fine. I found them pretty bad: they just were not realistic and they were so false that they were distracted from the real story. <br /> <br /> Maybe that distraction is the reason why I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "the whole". Do not bother to say what set, or what is special. That also makes it unclear why he is wanted in California, while the film's introduction takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you are filming a movie that takes place in the desert, make the effort to really go to the desert. The beginning, the ancient ceremony, seems to have been filmed inside a studio instead of in a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was constant throughout the film, without ups and downs, without climax. It made the movie seem short, and that's certainly a professional for this particular movie.
