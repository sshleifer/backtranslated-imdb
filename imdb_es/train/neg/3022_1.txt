I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. I usually see a preview of this good one and buy the movie directly. Something told me that ... you know, you see it first. I am happy to have done it. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for that. I think that had to do with his hair and having to cut it for Domino. <br /> <br /> Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or care. I do not know who was in real life or who was in this movie. I did not care about his character and even Keira undressing in particular did not make it worth the movie. Definitely the address was missing. The writing was trite and superficial. The edition was horrible. I do not care about the style as much as the excessive misuse of it. There is a place for it. Good examples of chopped style, MTV style, colorful edition (I'm not sure if there is an official name) would be Fight Club; Right next to the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi-similar editing style in some parts. It was used with good taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean, this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please, give me back my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who have liked this movie. I guess the idea that you will love this movie or hate it is a fair evaluation. Frankly, I hate it.
