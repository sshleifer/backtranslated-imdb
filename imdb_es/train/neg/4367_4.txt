One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. Essentially, the moribund Karloff (who seems to be about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to finish his experiments before he dies. When moving from Morocco, where another person takes charge of its financing, he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor while trying to discard enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for the money, he makes a deal with the young and wealthy wife of a cotton baron who is dying. She will finance him if he helps her to poison the husband so that he can take his money and continue with a gigolo (who I think is married). If you think I understood that when you see the movie you are wrong, I had to read what other people published to find out what happened. Why? because this movie lost me two minutes ago. He had no idea what was going on with his numerous characters and his multiple converging story lines. Little is explained and much is not said until the end, when I really did not care. It's a boring mess of interest purely because of Karloff's performance, which is sometimes quite strange. To be honest, this is the only time I've seen him venture into the strange territory of Bela Lugosi. They are not all the scenes, but a few, and I wonder how much they were left.
