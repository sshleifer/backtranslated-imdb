This movie was made by a group of white kids who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, except that it looks like it was made by a group of white men who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white men of the same age. It's almost like watching a group of boys in the boys camp who turned the camera on themselves. The movie has no argument. Just repeat the same action of the blood bath after the blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedies. But they do not exchange flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Cartoon scenes are used to cover things that were obviously out of your budget or resources to do, and they do not do very well at that. Everything that can not be done with the white men who run down the beach covered in blood is made with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer, which looks like a Tarrentino. piece. Well, the scenes of the trailer are as good as ever. The rest simply repeats the same kind of mundane, insane comedy. Sometimes it works, but it gets boring after the same thing happens again and again. It's more like a series of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a kind of comedy that hits you with the head. I can see where the idea of ​​the story is intriguing. But, in this post-apocalyptic film the United States looks a lot like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says that the ideas of history came from that time. He plans to do a Part 2. I guess he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe he's doing a parody. <br /> <br /> At the opening in Los Angeles, Wheatley mentioned that he will regain almost the same cast in Part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the next, to which he responded, well, yes , Clear.
