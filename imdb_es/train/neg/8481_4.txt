The performance was horrible and they were so wrong in sports ... they not only got the figure skating rules wrong, but also the rules of the Ice Hockey of CHICAS. In the ice hockey CHICAS you can not prove it. It also does not BLOCK for someone. Not all girls are disgusting, bad and big. I play hockey and I only have 4'11 and they have asked me to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also, not all hockey players hate skaters. Many of the current girls' hockey players were once figure skaters. We also skate a LOT faster than the ones in the movie. I felt embarrassed by the movie that gave people the idea that we stink ....... although I must mention that it is difficult to make a transition between sports due to the selection of the toe in the figure of the skates ... also some of those twirly moves that KAtelin was doing on the ice, you could not do it in a regular hockey game. Basically, she tripped over the person, which is unlawful. Nor is it realistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she calculates skates. That really made me angry because the scholarship would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
