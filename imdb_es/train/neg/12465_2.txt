Excessively complicated and monotonous. I'm a bright guy, but this was too much for a tired brain. I would really benefit from some early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing. It's probably better for the American market. The same GC insinuated that this alone did not provide his Oscar and you can see why. <br /> <br /> Even so the sand dunes are nice. The pulling of the nails is unpleasant. Dad's drunk lawyer is a mystery. The cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to write the ten lines required in this, even though it is more than 2 hours long. Thank God they shortened it. It's true that we did not get much to the photos, but the last movie we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better and I really do not like Johnny Cash. My wife says that George still looks good with his beard and a few extra kilos, so ... I almost arrived? <br /> <br /> How about now?
