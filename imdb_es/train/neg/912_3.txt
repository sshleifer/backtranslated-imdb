... for one of the worst Swedish films in history ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have not seen the first one (I was bored, that's my reason to see the second movie). before the first one), well, I hope that the first one is better than this, it was full of scenes of strange cuts and very strange plot changes, for people who have seen this and think that 4/10 is high (believe me, I also), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so extravagant and I laughed thinking about the punk that I came up with this idea, what follows is "Det sjunde inseglet II". The sequels that are not based on a novel or a book are not very good often, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, Got a few decent jokes and a slapstick humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let another idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director probably has already laughed ...
