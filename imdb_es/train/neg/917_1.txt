This movie was made in very bad taste. The script was really bad. I feel very sad for the late Gregory Peck, who took on the lead role of this B movie adaptation of one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought against the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene in which I almost vomited, showed Macarthur in a bunker on the island of Corregidor talking to the troops like an experienced politician when he meets him. A wounded, a Filipino soldier with legs. The soldier who bleeds and dies manages to sit up straight when he sees the general and says: 'no dad, no mom, no uncle Sam' and Macarthur gives his little talk that Americans will "never leave" the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier invigorated by the words of Macarthur and gives him an intelligent greeting. I mean, if there was one more condescending scene that portrayed the United States as the great white savior of the world, please tell me, because this one takes the cake. He showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress unable to honor and have to depend on the great Americans only for redemption. He overcame in a flagrant and deliberate way the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (Armed Forces of the United States of the Far East), these are Filipino volunteers who joined the US Army. UU During World War II, they died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side by side with the Americans on Bataan's death march and defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerrilla offensive after Macarthur I left for Australia with his famous speech "Regresar√©". My late grandfather, a Filipino 2 world war veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the country of origin. I think this film does not honor them or the other thousands of people to whom Macarthur relied on his intelligence preparations for his famous return on the Gulf of Leyte landing.
