A young basketball genetics professor is investigating the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He has been pressured to conclude his research because he has not published, so the university is having problems justifying its funding (I think). <br /> <br /> Makes a test injection into a monkey, which dies quickly. Then he tries on himself. He begins a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying child; she was the one who had been demanding results of the investigation. <br /> <br /> Initially, it seems to have no effect from the injection, except for a new force. Then he realizes that he had some memory loss and begins to remember what happened. Also, it starts to look very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> As the movie is called metamorphosis, it eventually becomes something else. You will not believe what your eyes see, neither in what became, nor in the absolutely horrible disguise that the actor is using to describe what he has become. Incredibly, there is an additional change in the store: the end of the movie is really, really absurd. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film is dedicated to is that Laura Gemser is in it, but it has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I had once seen a video box for this with a sculpted plastic shape attached to the lid of the box. You may even have had some electronic components at the same time, perhaps the eyes that light up (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green in the movie). The copy I saw had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had remained on the plastic, which had been removed. The novelty of the box lid, if I still had it, would have been the only reason why I would have clung to this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of that.
