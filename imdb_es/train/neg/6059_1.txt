I must say that I am a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing, probably his best movies. <br /> <br /> Then you got this POS. I can not, logically, think that he has put a great effort into this as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to see this from the point of view that it did not look like a movie. It seemed that someone else had run it for one thing. I do not think Carpenter put any effort into this at all. <br /> <br /> I just listened to their old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was amazing, especially for the time. <Br /> <br /> I was using a style that nobody had and it worked very well for their films.
