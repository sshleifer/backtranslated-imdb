I'm a bit of a fan of Lynche's work, so I got excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show a disquieting and disgusting mood. The animation is very crude, undoubtedly made using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a fat guy who hits his family and generally acts like an imbecile to everyone he meets. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be impressed by it. However, if you've spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will not be different from any of the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing a much better job than what is shown on this DVD. If Lynch sent this work to the website, it would blend in perfectly with some of the best Newgrounds artists. But, as I saw it on DVD, instead of Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have done otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expected a better quality in both the story and the animation.
