I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought it was great in Top Model and I was very happy when it won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a great guy. But this show made me sick! I'm so angry at both of them because of what happened on that show. I do not care that they had different ages, I know that age can not be interposed between love. But Adrianne, you had been together ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. I was not at all surprised that he had not proposed. And I do not see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. If it is meant to be, then why not simply ENJOY the other's company and love each other, and let it arise naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and a chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, I'm ashamed of you for breaking up and proposing to her anyway! You have gone through two failed marriages, how could you rush to another just because she had an attack? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can breathe and find the right reasons to marry within marriage.
