Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much anyway, I would prefer to see the dry paint) it still stinks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these guys at Low Budget Pictures. I was attracted to buy some DVDs to support some Indian filmmakers and I regretted it. Some have not even officially "launched" yet (they have not bought the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even list how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them, as they appear in other small movies of which they are friends. If you're friends with these guys, it's likely that you were in their movies and had fun doing them. But for those who had to see them? No way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot ... etc., etc. They are not even funny. I gave this a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's it. Maybe he does not even deserve the 2. Around a 1 / 16th star to show he was a little better than the first (he wish he had qualified in the negatives). If you want a decent movie without a budget, choose something from the "friends" of LBP in Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. Those are actually decent.
