I also saw this film at the High Falls Film Festival in New York and I must say that it seemed a total and terrible boredom. Although it was fun in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to talk about and that the performance in some places was scary and wooden, especially the "lovely lady" and the voice of the narrator (who never I've heard about) I had a lot to desire. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, the real action and the guts and (out of the cast) the only real performance. I'm sure that with another cast and a stricter reign in the direction, this could have been a decent half movie. Hopefully it will not be sent to the general version, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain box in Lidl.
