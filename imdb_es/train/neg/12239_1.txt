Since I was eight years old I have been a big fan of wrestling. It did not matter what federation saw. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, action is everything I saw it for. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. That was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and expected another payment per vision. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, that was the night when one of the best fighters to have left Canada, a true human being fell to his death due to a trick that went wrong. There is not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened after Owens' death made me angry. <br /> <br /> Instead of ending pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings, the WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money keeping the Pay Per View going as if the death of Owens It never would have happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life, but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And this shit with saying that Owen would have wanted the payment view to stay. Give me a break. When someone dies in a paid view, their common sense is to stop it. It's like a police officer who shoots a thief or assailant with a career and then lets the man die so he can go home and spend the day as if the man's life had never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens, we'll miss Owen and thank you for the memories of all the times you gave us.
