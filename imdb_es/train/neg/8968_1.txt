The writing on the screen is so silly that it hurts me to have lost 2 hours of my life that I will never go back (where I've heard this before). The acting is regular. Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something awful to happen. However, there is not a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie, which in the end did not make much sense, the cube zero has realized that and tries to recount exactly the same story, except that this time it has an unpleasant point to try. to explanations for every detail that the first movie did not answer. The funny thing is that the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat strange and tries to explain them. But the scenes are only copied, there is no coherence. This script is very useless. I imagine it was written by a 15-year-old enthusiast with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is that in the end, they paralyze the "good" boy prodigy, and he becomes the delayed guy in the first movie, and you see him when they find him ("this room is green ...") in Cube 1997. Goodie Gooodie, applaud, what a turn. First of all, what happens if you have not seen the first one? This does not make any sense that you're an imbecile director. Oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify the x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time there are 3 letters, each of which provides one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Duh Except now the permutations no longer make much sense ... so let the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want to recover my money. <br /> <br /> I guess I had to write this since there are a lot of bad, inconsistent or just plain stupid ideas in this movie. The directors / writers must be forced to possess some talent.
