This movie was so bad it was ridiculous. Although I could not resist seeing it. The plot is standard, the acting is pretty horrible (the supporting cast, like the crazy neighbor and the lawyer friend, were better actors). Something fun if you have time to lose and you like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The headliner that plays "Kathy" was simply fascinating because I could not decide if her implacable, flat effect was the result of bad surgery or just a bad performance (I decided it was both) . This leaves the script to comment, which was pretty horrible. Pat's comments, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of all the characters in the film. Maybe this is what was so fascinating; I do not know. I just saw it to see how bad it could be. (Actually, dialogue can not even be described as "clich√©", but it is almost completely inane.) <br /> <br /> In general, a very bad and cheap movie. The scenarios, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown again and again without art or real connection to the action; more like accessories that were thrown at random in action in a bad play. A chase scene could have been filmed by any young man in a warehouse or in an old school: poor shooting, cheap accessories, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the end. Go figure.
