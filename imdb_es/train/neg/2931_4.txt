The sitcom "The League of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several strange inhabitants of the fictional town "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their common configuration. <br /> <br /> In the first series, an outline, the main plot is about a new road to be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit the small city. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" store, which is actually far from the city, do not like foreigners. Every time a visitor enters his store, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes lack flavor and are not at all funny, for example, when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward plays the drums, while Tubbs dances half naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition, Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local Job Center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. Then, when an unemployed man receives an interview as a firefighter, she does not let him go because he is not ready for work yet. <br /> <br /> Then there's Barbara Dixton, a transgender taxi driver who gets in a great place. details about "your" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery, always kills the animals instead of curing them. In one case, he comes to a farm and is led to the living room, where a dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes out into the street. Assuming that the dog is the sick animal, Mr. Chinnery sacrifices it. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding in his hand the sick "real" animal, a sheep. <br /> <br /> Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by his nephew (his friend). friend is killed by the owners of the store, by the way). The couple is very organized. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and classified with precision. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. When playing women, the scenes become funny. The costumes are suitable for the actors, too. Tubbs wears a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of dark, typical British humor. The design of the set reflects the mood of the series. The town and all the houses look gray and deteriorated. Around the local store there is often fog that reinforces the menacing effect. Even the sign of the people is disturbing: "Welcome to Royston Vasey, you will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors do a great job, this kind of series is not my taste.
