To be honest the moment I heard this program for the first time, although it may be a bad idea to do a program that makes Muslims use racial jokes in themselves, but it is the exact opposite. I realized that doing a program that helps people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in real life does not mean it is something terrorist. It also shows how people give a bad name to Muslims because they play with their stereotype. Seeing the program, ordinary people will realize that, although there are bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live 1 day a day, like how difficult it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words as "Blow up" or Yaser saying that we will blow up the competition, and people took it incorrectly. Being a Muslim, I know that things like this do not usually happen, but they do and many people think badly of the Muslims or of Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not like that. People will see how they treat us badly when they see this program and can make them think about how they behave. I'm glad that a show like this came to the air. There are many programs that show that the Muslims of Piotr as terrorists, many people find them funny for my opinion, it is good to do it from time to time, because usually everything makes fun of who we are to say that you can not make fun of that. Unfair, but it's done often and it really gives the Muslin people a bad name.
