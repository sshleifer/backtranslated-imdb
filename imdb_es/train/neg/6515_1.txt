This is not a boring movie, the public could stay in their chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both filmmaker and actor here. The plot is simple: after a divorce and ten years of non-Hollywood without a career, the author plays in search of love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true all this is: what is written, what came by chance. Both answers, "yes" or "no" represent M.Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you are looking for an autofiction about this type of love, I recommend that you read some independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Besides this, I felt quite disappointed to hear it. So much against my country, France. I know that Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (that could be true at that time), etc., and of course the French (and the whole world) have many problems against America, but why so much hatred? Do not think I could not like this movie just for that anyway.
