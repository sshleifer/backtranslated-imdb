I am a fan of artistic films, but unfortunately I have to report that this movie is pretentious nonsense. Agonizingly slow to develop a nonexistent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying. Even after the bad movies I feel that I learn something, or I enjoy some aspect, but there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends there. The performance was fine, although the characters were completely boring. For the protagonist to aim at such a bold goal, it is tremendously empty. Pity. Usually, I enjoy movies that are not formulated, but the lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
