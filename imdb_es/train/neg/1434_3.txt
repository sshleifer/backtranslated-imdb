James Bond in the desert? Well, that's what it looks like: after all, Pierce Brosnan is better known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995), both taken before this version. Frankly, the two main tracks of the film are very bad, with Brosnan in marginally more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau (like Pony, the love interest of Gray Owl) who has to battle with a carelessly written dialogue. <br /> <br /> The two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the movie is not about aunts. It is about the wild lands of the Canadian jungle. And while photography can be beautiful, there is nothing against the harsh reality of living in nature. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, simply does not manage to be convincing, unfortunately, because she really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old girl in this movie, and it might have worked, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps not strong enough for her. He makes her appear vulnerable, which, of course, is ... but in a wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, she looks perfect at all times. But eye mascara and thickener in the desert? It just does not fit, especially since it seems like it just seems to walk through the forest trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and use photos in photos to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've lived with the people of the forest in the Pacific Northwest, and they just do not look so pretty and stay so sweet as they struggle to survive. Which brings me to another point: the film does not evoke the period in which it takes place: the 1930s. Here I largely blame a dull script that is interested in preaching at the expense of the dramatic arc, the points of the plot and those little details that can evoke the period through the action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script, and his latest offer, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" opened three days ago, so I hope there's an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read the comments that others have posted, but 'I am not convinced. A lot of potential, but badly managed and even badly conceived. If he had had a religious film, he would have been criticized, but because he preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is "politically correct". I'm sorry, for all that, I do not buy it. Amen.
