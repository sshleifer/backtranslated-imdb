Have you noticed how in his later films Burt Reynolds' laughter sounds like screeching brakes? <br /> <br /> He must have been dating too much with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And for the "Stroker Ace" aspect, too. "<br /> <br /> Can you believe that this was based on a book? I could not either, but it was. not a bestseller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another older kid on the NASCAR circuit who hooks up with Beatty as a fried chicken mogul with designs on his team. of love that exists and Nabors makes his tenth Gomer Pyle as a faithful mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends with Burt or Hal. Others must have needed the job, and even the real drivers of NASCAR are put into action and seek to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As for the laughter, Bubba Smith (before the "Police Academy") has them as a driver of Beatty. And Petersen, in Elvira's complete mode, receives many appreciations as a lady who wants to know Lugs very well. <br/> <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Bur I have not thrown so much time and effort into a movie like "Stroker Ace," where it did not matter if he bothered to act or not. They did not bother to write a character, why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Especially for Petersen, and for the exits at the end. Now they are fun.
