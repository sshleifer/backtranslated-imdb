['The last of the films by Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan and also something good, since this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made in a period of 16 years. No mermaid appears here, as a beautiful island woman tries to escape from the clutches of her people, who loves a god and tries to force her to be his girlfriend. Find Tarzan and Jane, who try to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest, but he is not used to his total advantage. Also on hand and worth mentioning is an enormously annoying guitarist / singer who plays the song from time to time. Even the &quot;great&quot; Robert Florey can not help this one. <br /><br /> * 1/2 (of four)']
