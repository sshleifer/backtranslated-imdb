Despite the excellent cast, this is a movie without complications, especially from the perspective of aviation. It may be something better than the atrocious "von Richthofen and Brown", but not by much. "Blue Max" is still the best of a small market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if you do not take it seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new high-quality WW I aero film.
