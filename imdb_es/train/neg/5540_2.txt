After watching Revolt Of The Zombies, starring the future winner of the Dean Jagger Academy Award, I was left with a burning question. How was a society that created these last fighting machines of warriors defeated in the first place? <br /> <br /> That's the question you'll be thinking about if you take the time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of World War I, the French discover a cult of occupied Cambodia, where these undead creatures that can not be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks that go over and dislodge the Hun. <br /> <br /> This scares the live fecal matter of all involved, so an international expedition is formed to discover how to destroy the secret of these zombies so that no nation can control and rule the world. <br /> <br /> But we've got a bit of dissidence in those rows. The first is the villain of Snidely Whiplash Roy D'Arcy who murders the Buddhist monk who has the secret and the second is Dean Jagger. As we all know, power is the ultimate aphrodisiac and is determined to keep Dorothy Stone from rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have an idea of ​​how this occurs, especially since a race of zombies did not conquer the world for only one country. Dean Jagger when he won the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High must have shuddered every time he thought about this movie and the horrible dialogue he tried to give it a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> Moral of the story you can make a definitive warrior with the zombie potion and the singing of zombies, but you can not make a slave of ultimate love.
