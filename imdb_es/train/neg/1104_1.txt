This is one of the worst written films I've had to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new, but it's a caricature, so who cares, as long as it's pretty and fun. <br /> <br /> I will not go into depth as much as the characterizations, or I'll be here all day (except to say there are none, the characters change their personality when it's convenient for the plot), but whoever he has written the script and the visual address must be banned from both the pencil and the paper. Thumbs down? I would vote to cut off his thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Narrow on an object / object" Cut to the foreground of the character The character gives a look of complicity, which the audience will not even understand remotely Repeat it several times, with different objects / accessories . "<br /> <br />" Make the characters pay no attention to all the huge chunks of rock that float around, colliding with each other, generally raining destruction everywhere, and what could kill them all at any time , but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see an almost pastoral green rock looking harmless in the distance. " <br /> <br /> All this is a long succession of events, actions and behaviors that are only there for the convenience of the writer, to avoid having to think or make any effort to write the story correctly. . <br /> <br /> This is Plan 9 of the CG cartoons, except it does not have a moan factor from Ed Wood to make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
