Okay, I remember seeing the first one, and the boy had him suck. After watching it, I laughed and said to myself: "Oh boy, just another low budget B movie, I will never see part 2 of this." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, the second part arrived. It stinked even more. But, I just laughed again and said, "there's no way I'll ever see part 3 of this." Then, about 1/2 year later, the third part came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and, boy, I snapped after seeing it. God, I never really realized how much movies can aspire these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not rent the entire series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
