1st view 5/27/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The third Universal Mummy movie is almost the same as the first two in terms of the final result from the perspective of the viewer. The story is similar and the results are boring. This time, the location of the story is that of the United States, since the new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country with the hope that he can revive it to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which does not make much difference because he is not really asked to act much for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue attendant in the city and sends the mummy to do his dirty things after giving him the juice of the tanna leaf. Once again, a girl stands in the way, while the priest falls in love with one of the offspring's fianc√©e and wants her to be immortal with him (have not we heard this before?). The plan, of course, is thwarted when the locals hunt the mummy with torches (similar to Frankenstein's monster) and the creature's burning ends the story ... how do they get a sequel? I guess you'll find out with the next one in the series. or not.....
