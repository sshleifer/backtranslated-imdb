If you like a soap opera of Syfi, this show is for you, since it seems to me that it does not work for me and after seeing 3 episodes I can not see it anymore. It's boring and slow, and for a show that the timeline is based on more than 100,000 years ago, if it's based on the battlestar galactica timeline to get to Earth, it looks like they have all the same things as the vans 100,000-year-old Chevy driving down. The streets and the people watching the popular 100,000-year-old LCD TVs. It also happens the same with the rest of the sets, as well as in the program, there is a lot of what is involved in today to not overlook it, I think they could have done a much better job to solve these problems and Yes , Battlestar Galactica had some of the same problems, but not so much. Like the rest of the show, it is not as good as it was BSG and it is a bad previous sequel.
