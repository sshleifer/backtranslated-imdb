Everyone said that the movie Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake in playing the actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the movie. His childish look is not really good. Even in the movie, the story of the movie makes no sense at all. Everyone said that the Taratino Quetin of India is Vijay, but it is not at all. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is a great caliber actor and this movie is not. Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film, since everything is Saif. The style and the photormola are not very good in this movie, I was disappointed.
