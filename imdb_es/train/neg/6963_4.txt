The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies. They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters that come from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had the money to achieve convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures, from the giant octopus to the giant lobster, trying to dominate humans. It is extremely uncomfortable and laughable, but also very pleasant. After all, we like these creatures and these movies, after all, right?
