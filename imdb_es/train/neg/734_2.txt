This movie was bullshit with a capital "C". The opening scene was promising. But that "promise" broke shortly after the viewer knew where the plot is going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Morty, which was pretty spooky in the original movie, seems ridiculous in this one. It was so obvious that he was just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And, by the way, who else thinks that "Morty" is one of the most fearsome names on planet Earth? It's between "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to the value of horror, or why not name it? the wooden statute Henry-freakin'-Kissinger. "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as scary as "Morty." <br /> <br /> And then there's a scene where the "hero" hits. your father's gravestone with --- "a hammer?" you could guess - "two-four?" someone might venture in. No, he pisses off his father's gravestone with a twig, a very rare twig. worse than that, once the characters move away, the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds in. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> There is also a Native American boy who lives with the grandparents of the main character, but Apparently, he does nothing except Morty-maintenance He perpetuates Morty's creepy legends, warns mockers and even fixes Morty's arm when It is damaged during a child's joke. But despite all his respect and tenderness towards Morty, Morty gives him a shaggy rat from behind? No. <br /> <br /> The film is prolonged, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (more or less). This movie is a real yawn. Do not rent it
