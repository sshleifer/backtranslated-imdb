So far in the second week of "The lone of Beauty", I feel a bit disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are good, as long as it is not a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is an "objective" coverage of the "Thatcher" years; It's fine as drama, but I think the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow-up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with "Things Can Only Get Better" that ends in 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! With that promise of a government that is full of sordidness.
