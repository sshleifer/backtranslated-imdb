I took out this Blockbuster movie on one of those shelves where you can get about 5 movies for 20 dollars. I must say that I have the value of my money in this case. I expected a horrible dialogue, fucking monsters and shaky cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad, although not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've seen so many low budget movies recently that I've lost perspective. There are some fragments in which the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it is at least level of play in high school. <br /> <br /> The CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another critic agreed with me) was that a man in a monkey suit would have been better. The animated stop-motion animation would look better. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you may ask me why I call CG the second worst part. That's because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are noisy, annoying and constant. I've been camping, I know how insects sound in the forest at night and, while they may be noisy, they are not as deaf as the cacophony of this movie. Usually, when the "background" sounds like it drowns out the dialogue of the movie, it's a bad thing, but from what I got from the dialogue of this movie, I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The action was not frequent and boring. Tension did not exist, as did any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie cutters and bland. The only slightly entertaining game was between ... actually, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smile, but that was all. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was decent, one or two steps above what you normally see in a movie like this. However, it still has that quality of "home movie" that you get with the movies made in pocket change and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and you like genre films with a low budget, and you see this in the trash, think about catching it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
