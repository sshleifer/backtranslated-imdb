The only redeeming quality of this film is the real story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The performance was ridiculously bad, and the stage design was cheesy and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very hard to see because of the horrible performance. I would not recommend seeing this ... The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were something attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. Some of the editions were well done, but there are continuity errors all over the place ... I'm starting to get tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon?
