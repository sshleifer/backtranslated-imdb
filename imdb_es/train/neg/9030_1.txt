The faces are cut, the throats are cut, the jets of blood and, in the end, the three main characters are depressed or die. They even blow up Kevin Costner's dog with a shotgun. Why would someone want to see a movie like this? Violence is valid only when the good kill the bad guys, not the other way around. Take, for example, Underworld and Underworld Evolution, where you can enjoy seeing how justice is done when demons are killed. In this movie, the good ones are cut. See the difference? Why would anyone want to MAKE a movie that depresses the public? Beautiful photography and specialized editing in a movie like this is a waste of talent. Let's put it in the exquisite corpse category.
