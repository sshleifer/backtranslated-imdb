Okay, when I got to the board for this movie, I really expected people to make fun of it. I was surprised to see that people over 7 years liked it. I enjoyed the movie ... but only b / c and my little sister (who is, in fact, only 10) made fun of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Jordan, but that performance was horrible. You know that a movie goes to the bathroom when the cable can not act. And I did not even have a good script or argument to trade it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very scarce ... pathetic on the border. <br /> <br /> Even so, I thought there were some good actors, like the magnificent Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, it's not enough to redeem the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I can not get over: <br /> <br /> 1.) That Spencer boy would fall in love with her. It's fine, eww. I searched for the dates and, although in reality, he is only four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed to be much greater. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF she seemed to be 10 or 12 years old ... she looked like a little girl! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is some way in which Kristi Yamaguchi would come alone to skate for a girl. I mean, I know Katelin is good and all, but it still seemed unlikely that Kristi went to a boarding school that did not even have scholarships to skate, or that a school had hired a skating coach with such connections. . <br /> <br /> All this said ... it was not the worst movie that was ever known, but it was not very good even by DCOM standards, which I consider quite low.
