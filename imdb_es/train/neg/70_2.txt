This movie never reached the theaters in our area, so when it was available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listen to the critics and approve this one. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent training of actors, the film was very disappointing. Now I can see why it went directly to the video. <br /> <br /> I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush could have some value. Everyone has done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow and never attracted me. I could not show much empathy for the characters and I had to fight against the impulse to move forward to reach the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking of renting it only for "sweet eyes" purposes. It will not satisfy even that.
