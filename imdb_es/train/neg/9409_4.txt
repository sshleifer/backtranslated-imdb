I liked this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! Only Spidey does not hit anyone, but that's just why the show does not stink! Some people just think that this show is bad because of that. The story was great and it was funny when other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man. So bad Sandman never shows up but I like it a little! The best Spidey show! My favorite episodes are: 1. Inflection point 2. Spider wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The alien suit 5. Mutant agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot that was embarrassing to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in Season 2. Of course I should mention Hydro Man! It was terrible! I prefer to see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as Spider-Man! <br /> <br /> But I guess everything was bad!
