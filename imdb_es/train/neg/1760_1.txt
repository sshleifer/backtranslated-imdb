This movie makes several mistakes. some American actors in Spain, and Spanish actors who speak English. The English of 'Spaniards' is fine, but the way the performance is done makes it quite annoying. The dialogue through the whole script is very weak; It may have been a script in Spanish but incorrectly translated, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language, they can be good, but not in this failure. You'll discover the movie in the first 5 minutes, that's how pathetic it is. then the rest is simply bad. Much time wasted, many necessary plots of the UN. Oh, did I mention that one of the Baldwins is in this?
