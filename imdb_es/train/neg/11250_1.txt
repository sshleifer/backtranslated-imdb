I like the period of time, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that seems like I'm watching it through a bottle of Coke gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were so fuzzy and out of focus, I would update my computer. It could be that this was the look the director was looking for, but that does not hurt your eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not taken someone with me to this movie, I would be out of there. Although it was a series and not a movie, Banda de Hermanos achieved this. They made it look like a World War II video, with just a touch of grain, but it was still a pleasure to watch it. Movies need real people, with real sets and real locations; Use CGI when appropriate, not for a full movie.
