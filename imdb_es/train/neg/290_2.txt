['Killer Tomatoes movies have this kind of special humor: either you love it or you hate it. I personally like it, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are boring, even actors are not so funny. Because that&#39;s the only thing that is supposed to be this kind of movies - fun. <br /><br /> So now, following the plot made to laugh, is annoying. They really should not have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.']
