This movie was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a high body count. The acting was horrible. The murders were carried out very badly. Like when Ally got into the toilet, I guess she was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie arrives and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, you see Ally, so Angela must have gone looking for her. The part that really caught my attention was when the black girl and Angela were in the booth and Angela took the guitar string and choked it. One was a horrible performance and two, why do not you turn around and hit the bitch?!?!? So, when Molly is being chased by Angela, if you have the whinny, why not just turn around and stab her? So stupid. This movie stunk ...
