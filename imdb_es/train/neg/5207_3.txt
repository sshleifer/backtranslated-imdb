An anemic dramatic comedy, an unhappy and seemingly hasty adventure that presents Cher as an ostentatious housewife who slowly becomes friends with the hit man who was hired by her husband to kill her. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the script of his own work, with stagy configurations and a round-trip dialogue that tires quickly the eye and the ear. An air of sadness hangs over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can not get Cher out of his perpetual funk (he's indifferent). Despite all the best talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance in the story and the characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
