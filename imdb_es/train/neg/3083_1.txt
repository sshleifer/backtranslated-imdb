... bad at being intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem shot directly at the big screen MST3k. While it is obvious that the film is not trying to be taken seriously (fortunately, anyway ...), the movie is still bad. Hell, it makes Leprechaun In Space look like a big budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: Paint my colored muscle plum!
