I'm really surprised that a great director like Chuck Jones has started making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once in this short film, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for God's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring. Unfortunately, this short film turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is not a joke. Good Night Elmer was boring because he dragged the same two gags forever with a predictable payoff. This caricature, on the other hand, is affected by the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The caricature has at least more than two jaws in the sleeve, but most seem longer than it is thanks to the immense filling of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes dinner and comments: "That was a very good website for wamb", possibly the most redundant dialogue I've heard in a cartoon (characters reading text aloud in Woody Woodpecker cartoons of the later time). it does not count in my book). Even though this cartoon lasts only 8 minutes, it feels like 20 thanks to a redundant dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's pet Rabbit was not a funny caricature for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are not able to recognize that he ran some clunkers during his career, he might enjoy it.
