I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and I really looked for this movie (I had to get a Region 5 DVD in Chinese!). But, it's really one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The performance (with the exception of Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed this (although he is not accredited as a director), and they DO NOT have discernible talents to write or direct. (Follow with Willem's performance, Giada goes out of business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Except a series of totally unconvincing actions, totally without a credible motivation, by these two people (who have just met) in this house. The dream of Colagrande, I did not care less about the expression, practically NEVER changes. And the sex scenes are frankly lame. In fact, I shrugged twice in one of them. Disgusting They are definitely not erotic at all, and yet, they are the only time the movie does not make you sleep. Then, it is busy rejecting you. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible.
