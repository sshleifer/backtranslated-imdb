It was one of those last hours of the night "It's there." I saw things. Sometimes they are great. This was horrible, but it really should not have been. <br /> <br /> The movie had a really good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about Oscar-winning turf here. It had good special effects. I even had really good tits! And I mean, well shown, full breast with full nipple and in a moment even a little beaver. But it did not make up for the missing ingredient: a story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean the explosion of the sun from the "solar crisis", but that was bad enough. It was the rest of the things, the evil corporation things so stupid and totally predictable. The man who has just STANK! No amount of good spacecraft or good acting or fighting scenes could prevent that. <br /> <br /> I've seen that the cast members themselves are incredibly good. I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that they had emitted and tiny budgets. The whole difference is in the writing.
