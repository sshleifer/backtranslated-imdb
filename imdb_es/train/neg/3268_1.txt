It is a real challenge to make a film about a baby that is devoured by wild canines and that the mother is wrongly accused of a funny murder, but in spite of everything, it succeeds. Meryl Streep offers the performance of her life, melodramatic, overloaded, but with that comical genius that makes you laugh even when a mother struggles with the utmost horror. <br /> <br /> If comedies about babies that are eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you may find it uncomfortable to see this and, yes, it is a strange choice of subject for a farce, but really very little The movie has something to do with that, as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for its Australian accent and facial contortions. <br /> <br /> Casting a blow to media bias and sensationalism, and disregard for truth or ethics gives the film the opportunity to make the bold point that those things are bad.
