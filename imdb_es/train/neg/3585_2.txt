As a big fan of the gorilla movies in general, I anticipated that this would be great, and in terms of the effects of gorillas, they were quite good, however, that is the only thing I can write about this failure. The film claims to be based on a true story but, in fact, it does not even come close to what really happened to "Buddy", who in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" . Gertrude Lintz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who barely enjoyed the welfare of her animals in the best interest. To the extent that Buddy was aggressive, this was a total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. Buddy, in fact, escaped from his wooden box (not a luxury cage room as shown in the movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which scared Gertrude Lintz to sell it. No, Buddy was not released into a family of gorillas surrounded by leafy trees in a zoo paradise: he was abandoned in a wooden box, deep in the back of a garage for some time with a single bulb for his comfort and then sold to the circus, where he actually lived a better life when he was thrown peanuts until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla registered, by the way) before a show in Miami. Also note, in the movie, how Buddy grows old but chimpanzees never age. (Chimpanzees, by the way, did not breed simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as shown in the movie)
