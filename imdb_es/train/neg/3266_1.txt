When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has escaped with his own brother, he runs to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his pain story, only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: the effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan). Needless to say, Ben does not take it well and many complications follow, including Ben's attempt to get Norman to become homosexual by fixing him with a prostitute (Tammy Dobson). Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds much more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? It was an absolute disaster on the New York stage. In order to give the work its due, I actually saw it on stage in the 1970s as a community theatrical production, and although no one would accuse it of being nothing more than a superficial farce, the cast acted so broadly and so downcast which was quite fun It's a pity that the cast of this movie did not do the same. <br /> <br /> This is a moving image made atrociously. Red Foxx, one of the funniest comedians of the twentieth century is so much fun here as washing yesterday, Michael Warren (who later appeared in the TV series HILL STREET BLUES with much better effect) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; In fact, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a cameo from Wayland Flowers have some spark, and unfortunately, that's just in comparison to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Not only the badly made movie, it looks bad. According to the history of cinema, this was the first major cinematic effort that was filmed on a videotape, which was then transferred to celluloid for the purposes of the project, and believe me, it shows. The film looks like a bad comedy from the 70s to the horizon painted through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become fun, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? It's not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this movie in two words: I miss it. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with a ten foot stick. Just back off slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
