I went to see this at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and ... I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> Like a movie it was painful, but seeing Bret Carr in person was seeing the despair at its pinnacle. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was seeing BC hit in the face with what appeared to be a "C" battery. The jury is still deliberating on this. It was a dildo and was in slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Shoot only on the left side of the face ... people become famous by demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr put on a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, scouring the streets of Clifton and criticizing his own movie. He should. This is correct to hit the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt irritated after this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or smart enough for that matter. That's the feeling you get from the What's Bleeping drip of impressionable neo-yuppies who came to see this Bret Carr Piece of Work. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionally exhausting experience just to think about writing about this movie . , goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
