Although 2 years have passed, I still remember the complete waste that covers the entire plot of the film. Unfortunately, I found this movie after my friends and selected it while browsing the new versions of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only one we had not seen and it looked like it could be nice. Although it's been a while since I saw the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there's no real plot), and a complete waste of time I spent watching the movie. If you are in the video store and this movie catches your attention, walk and find a better movie. If you ended up watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
