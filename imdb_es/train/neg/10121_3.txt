The bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (like Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to go on a trip. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and the lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barry). But, they are still as boring as they were before. It could be said that boring director Alfred Hitchcock tries to encourage the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" by ordering some camera tricks. An opening tribute to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The lowest point can be the couple that eats the Chinese prepared cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
