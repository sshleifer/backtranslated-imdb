I just saw this movie today and it's not just it, it's terrible and horrible, but it seems that the director has just reunited some friends to make a film about a sick man. I also think that this movie looks like a porn video with a clear view, just filmed. <br /> <br /> Thank God, I work in a video store and I did not have to pay for this because this movie is shit x infinity ... DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE !!!!! You'll have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this shit! And that does not say much for that movie either. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad and the movie is very hard to see. I was watching this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I walked home and vomited after seeing this dirty movie, then I bathed and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had half the mind, I would take the film outside and burn it too because nobody should be subjected to it ... well, maybe the members of Al Queda ... especially the ones we have in custody and also rapists of children who are in prison for life without parole ... simply make a configuration like a clock that works with Orange, and then force these cheese heads to see it again and again.
