The men in the caverns were, by far, the biggest load of garbage I have lost in my time watching. This program based on Geico commercials is less entertaining than a real 30-second ad for Geico. The make-up was half done, at least, hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist. This program could have potential for a fun series if it could have obtained the cast of commercials, which in itself makes for a lousy program. Maybe if the writers were the same as Geico's ads, this might have had an opportunity, instead, the pilot lacked a good story. I give this show 1 out of 10, I would like to put a zero of 10, but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death in this program, I will give you less than 5 episodes before a worthy death dies.
