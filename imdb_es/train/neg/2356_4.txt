The film was made in 1942 and with World War II around, the film industry decided to capitalize on the fact that there were spies around. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch because of Eleanor Powell's fabulous dance. The late Miss Powell was undoubtedly a great hoofer in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young Red Skelton here. The two also starred in "I Dood It." <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was excellent when the police officer who interrogated "Mildred Pierce" again appears as an officer who asks Powell to deliver an article. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his brilliant regular self here and receives ample support from Virginia O'Brien.
