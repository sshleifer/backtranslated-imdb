I saw this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and, well, it seemed strange and completely useless ... so I decided to take a look and put my hands on the copy of the 70s. Wow. What a difference. The original was much better. I would like everyone to know that he originally made a statement, that his existence had a purpose. It was really the Christian public that expressed their fear of paganism. If you delve into it, you also comment on life, but I do not want to go into details, simply, in a few words, if you were disappointed and would like to know what it MUST look like, feel free to see the 70's Version, a little outdated , but much better.
