I watched about 30 minutes in this movie before I finally got tired of being hit in the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called 'argument', and each and every one of the actors. It's as if everyone thought they were the main part of the movie and shouted "WARNING!" and again. The bad boy has his bad boy music and says bad guy sinister things, in case you have not noticed. The good boy does brave and noble things in case you did not know he was the good guy. And oh sir, the plane scene. "MY HUSBAND IS DISAPPEARING, OH MY GOD, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOUR LEGS COULD BE REMOVED OR GO TO THE TOILET OR ANYTHING, IT MUST BE MISSING!" (And yes, I know, her clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic before she had time to look at the damn seat she had been in). <br /> <br /> As A religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film in which it was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want to recover my 30 minutes.
