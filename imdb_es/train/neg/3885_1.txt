This movie was not only bad, it was terrible. After seeing it, I really felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get rid of the dirt. It's running 'gag' with an elderly couple doing it, it's not fun, but it's disgusting. The monster's makeup was great, but that's it. Only continuity errors will make you angry, at least I was. The edition is really deficient. <br /> <br /> Almost anything else you can do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in "bad movies", this is exceptional in its ineptitude, I did not even dare to laugh at it. You have been warned.
