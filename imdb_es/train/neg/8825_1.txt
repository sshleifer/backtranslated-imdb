The only reason to give this film even a single star is how much it made me laugh the end. I had high hopes since I usually love the bad horror movies of the holidays, but this does not qualify. It really is just a bad attempt to show a character slowly creep into madness, which, again, is not a bad plot, but it gets bad here. There are some scenes (like the ending) that do not pretend to be fun, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times where I thought the movie would go in an interesting direction, but it never meets what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
