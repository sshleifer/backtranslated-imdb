I saw Chan Is Missing when it first came out, about four years after I moved from San Francisco to New York. Maybe it was the prospect of a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I've seen (still does). It focuses on a particular community, the Chinese, but that's fine, because much of the soul of the city is reflected through the configuration, the faces and, perhaps, especially the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not the San Francisco tourist. The adjustments are humble and everyday: a taxi, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, the townhouses of the Richmond district, the small apartments and offices of Chinatown, the docks, a center for Filipino elders. This is how the city looks and feels day by day for the people who live there, even now, in the urban development era of Silicon Gulch. Unlike, for example, Dirty Harry (in his own way, also an excellent San Francisco film), everything is filmed at street level: we come to understand the points of view of the characters from the perspective that the surroundings offer them , not from a dizzying point of view. shooting. <br /> <br /> Wang apparently filmed black and white because he had no money to do otherwise, but one of the film's strongest visuals is the natural light it achieves. The often harsh and penetrating quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: it seems to expose everything, reduce buildings, hills and other landmarks and, in a fun way, make people pass. on the streets it seems more individual and potentially closer to you than what could be elsewhere. Wang's picture conveys it perfectly, and even helps the story along the points. <br /> <br /> Wang captures the speech and conversation style of the Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone, I think. If there's something like a real "accent" from San Francisco, it's what you hear from the bald taxi medallion agent (I think) who appears talking on the phone in a scene (listen to the way he calls the person at the other end). "already dingaling!"). <br /> <br /> The story is poignant and, despite some small and small mistakes, it highlights very well the yearnings that attract the hearts of people living in the former immigrant communities, including the justified political resentments and ethnic, and small ironic diversions, that help to feed them. All this is communicated with delicacy, perhaps why some respondents here think that the film meanders. It is not enough to say that the search for the two taxi drivers by Chan becomes a search for something more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ends with a Chinatown travel sequence backed by a fun and novel song from the 1930s (I guess) on San Francisco and all its crazy diversity. An American caricature, yes, but somehow not completely out of place either.
