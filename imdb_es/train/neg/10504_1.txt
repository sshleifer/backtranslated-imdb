I could not see more than 14 minutes of that. It is a BIG combination of really bad acting and very bad direction. The shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts trying to see that load of "you know what". The dirt in the window of the "mysterious machine" makes him see the light of the lighting of the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so badly framed all the time that it just makes you want to yell at that lady who runs there. I only directed short films, but I'm pretty sure it would be much better than directing a feature film ... the story is amazing, only the long scene of French kisses at first tells you it's going to be pretty horrible. So, more or less, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, it will save you 5 dollars or more for rent, and that 1 hour and a half of your life will never come back ...
