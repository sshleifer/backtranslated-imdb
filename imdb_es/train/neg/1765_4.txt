Well, the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of the main attractions of Barcelona. Otherwise, the value of the production was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the movie felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was lovely and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the greatest depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He put a good use of his martial arts training and became an action figure of running, jumping and seriousness. The rest of the cast was made of wood at best, but mostly paper. So, if you feel nostalgia for Spain, it's a postcard with a touch of action and a good dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
