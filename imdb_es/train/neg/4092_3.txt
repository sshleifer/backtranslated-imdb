I like Fulci's films, I really like them and not in a boring and ironic way, but I recognize that they seem irremediably inept and confusing for many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries to understand the epic fantasy. Gender and really does not succeed. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, more things happen and, on occasion, one scene may be tangentially related to another. It really is like Conan without sets, without a script, without real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is not an actor either), without a budget, stupid soldiers dogs and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> This was a difficult one to overcome and I could have lived without the inch of Vaseline stained on the camera to give it that musical video look of Hair Metal.
