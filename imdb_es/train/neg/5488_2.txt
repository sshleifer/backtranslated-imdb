Why the hell is Colin Firth in this movie meaningless? Has he really been so tied up with money? <br /> <br /> The movie is not clear about what it is, shame, exotic places, ghosts, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It is a confusing, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> There seems to be some kind of idea that Italy should be good in itself, and that Italian has something to offer as a language, but in the end the girls just want to go back to Yankland. <br /> <br /> There are useless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads, but what it is about or why someone should worry is simply not clear. <br /> <br /> There was also a woman pull in the movie. It was not clear what the job was here, but it seemed like he was only there to make vile, inappropriate, and sensible comments to the girl. Was it supposed to be paedophillia? <br /> <br /> A pretty terrible mess, in general. I gave him 2 instead of 1 because he does not have the charm of an absolutely frightening movie.
