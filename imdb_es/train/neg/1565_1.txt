The film uses a cutting-edge title for a lame story. Killing Killing would have been good. The film incorporates taboo scenes for the viewer to return to their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and choppy. The movie is something that a novice screen writer could have conjured up. Just a waste of movie accessories and money from the network. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to keep going so that people know how to avoid the nonsense. If people count on you to choose a good movie for the movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not harm it by submitting to this filth.
