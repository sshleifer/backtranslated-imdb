A very good story for a movie that, if done correctly, would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the point of this? <br /> <The scenes slid by so quickly that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being separate from understanding the story. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast are questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I guess we have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
