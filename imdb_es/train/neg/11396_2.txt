The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" is inspired by everything that came from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but manages to do it with enough humor to see it ... barely. The characters are made of cardboard, the dialogue is made of wood, the story is as thin as paper and the actors could not get out of a shopping bag. Put everything together and you'll have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar to that. Chew it for 90 minutes and it has a strange taste in its mouth and no nutritional value.
