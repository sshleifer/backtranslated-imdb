Alone in the dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the Hollywood nuts after the House of the Dead hit his face. <br /> <br /> In any case, it shows how good a Boll master manipulator is. After forcing Artisan to close his business on the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume that normally credible Lion's Gate Films only launched AITD under the contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan assets. Because AITD is an even greater example of the complete lack of coherent filmmaking capacity, the plot of exposure and the simple theft of other films because it was supposed to look good rather than because it fit within the framework of the movie. <br /> <br /> But that's the point, is not it? Boll is not trying to make a coherent film because he is not trying to direct Alone in the Dark. Just try to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "advertised" or "pre". production. "<br /> <br /> These are not films to be directed, but investment portfolios, each and every one of them went into production under the pretext that the tax law that Boll and his investors are exploiting It could be closed within the next 2 to 3 years.The more bomb projects it can launch within that period, the more money it and its investors can earn Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie is making you a mint The result is films like the horror of Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, like all his other films, are just a cynical exploitation of the current Hollywood trend for making lazy movies . <br /> <br /> And for those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making him a cult figure for man, it's only making it easier for him to get investors but giving him e notoriety. br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php ? s = & threadid = 21699 As a side note, do not ask me how you are putting together your casting lists. Unless the actors are involved in the investment scam in some way, that mystery has yet to be discovered.
