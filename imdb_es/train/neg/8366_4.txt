'SherryBaby' is a rather painful and sordid melodrama unfolding in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of prison in search of a drug-related conviction and struggles to stay clean, to find a place for her in life and especially to recover the love of her daughter, who is being cared for by her brother's family. The only reason you can see the movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole movie on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, since the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put in the wrong place. I wondered in the whole scenario if I'm supposed to regret the ex and perhaps the future drug addict. Mother as director and screenwriter wanted, or about the innocent child that is in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance could not convince me that I should not worry more about the child.
