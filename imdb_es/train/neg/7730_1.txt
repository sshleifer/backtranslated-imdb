Despite a lot of style, flare and brightness, this French musical does not speak. The melodies are repetitive, predictable and tedious. The story is not interesting, as are the many characters. <br /> <br /> People start to sing and dance, without motivation or reason. The majority of the cast uses fake-looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets seem irremediably linked to the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version stopped before the end, a negative effect that it had on me. Certainly, a shame, to have such a talented cast in such a weak final effort. <br /> <br /> I guess where the followings (in this case, the great classic, "Umbrellas") often go wrong. One can not recapture, only recreate.
