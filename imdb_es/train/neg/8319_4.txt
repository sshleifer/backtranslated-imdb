Pretty unimpressive. The 'twists' are all quite predictable, if you've seen a movie in the last ten years, and the few interesting parts (in which someone uses context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much impact, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The acting is decent enough. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole premise 'still awake' is annulled by the astral projection (no kidding). <br /> <br /> The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit uncomfortable, but then it becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, but not memorable. The less interesting role of Terrence Howard to date, from what I've seen. <br /> <br /> Kind of boring, in general.
