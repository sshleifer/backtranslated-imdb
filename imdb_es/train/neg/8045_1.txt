I'm very confused. What was this movie about in the world? What was the motivation of the murderer? He seemed pretty angry, but I still have to figure out why. Nothing in this movie makes sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I suppose would make it a hill. Or a pile. Shitty. The acting was horrible. When I looked for some of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that I had heard about, and that was no surprise. I can not decide whether to feel sorry for them for the shame of being in such a bad movie, or for feeling that they should never be offered another acting job. Starting . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, however, do not waste your time with this. There is so little substance that there is nothing there even to mock. This was undoubtedly one of the worst films of Slasher. NO, one of the worst movies of ANY KIND, that I have had the misfortune to see, and I have seen some.
