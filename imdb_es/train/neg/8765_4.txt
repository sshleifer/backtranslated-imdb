I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas day. The quick summary of this movie MUST BE AVOIDED. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did not do any of these works well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's 1999 attempt to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region from India. . Supposedly, according to the facts, this film gives a clue to the difficulty the Indian army had in recovering the area from the Pakistani troops, who occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, all this film does is make the Indian army look ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with almost A completely Indian audience, who was very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but they also laughed at scenes that should not be funny. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely abysmal. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta does not know anything about how an army works and was using bad war movies as a reference. The result is a script that has no brain and is repetitive. <br /> <br /> The performance of most of the directors was not stellar, but considering the script they received, I find it difficult to criticize them too much. As for the cast cast, all I can say is that I hope they are amateurs. <br /> <br /> The edition was also pretty bad. It was quite difficult to follow what happened most of the time, and the music would end abruptly with the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: the cinematography was pretty good, although it was a bit damaged by the fact that the film did not seem to have a color correction (the color balance often varied significantly within the scenes) . In addition, the few songs that were in the film were quite pleasant, at least during the first half dozen verses. Unfortunately, they went a lot longer than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess lasts four hours. There is enough here so that a good editor can almost squeeze a good movie of 1.5 to 2 hours of what was shot. Unfortunately, a good editor was not working on this film.
