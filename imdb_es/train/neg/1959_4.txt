The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of a deformed old witch who draws children to her house to get a prize for her missing tooth and then takes her life. The first minutes introduce you to the beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy in 1949 and then move on to the present. The weathered horror plot was saved to a great extent by the solid performance. They could have dispensed with the Hammond brothers and some other scenes, but in general the bloody scenes were bloody but fast, which had a minimizing effect. The sweet eye is good enough for both sexes. The camera work is good. The dialogue is fair but corny. I expected the film to be a skeleton, low budget, with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
