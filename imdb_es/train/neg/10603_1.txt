I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still could not get to the final credits. The first time I managed to sit down in the first fight sequence, I lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to digest more than an hour of poor quality, SFX and an extremely bad address. It pales in comparison with the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who have not let me inform them. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest blockbusters of all time ... Atari decides to launch a movie game on his 2600 home console system. To shorten a long and financially painful story, the game failed as great and resulted in thousands and thousands of Atari 2600 ET games that will be unloaded in landfills because they could not even give them away, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at the classification 3.2 and discover it yourself. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie ... IMDb forced me to give it 1 out of 10 because its rating systems are not as low as 0 and much less in the negatives.
