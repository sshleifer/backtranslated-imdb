Daniella has some problems working out under her exterior appeal. She begins to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (whom she resembles) who was burned for being a werewolf. She gets a little wild when she counts horny men and cuts their throats. Finally, he finds a man who helps contain his inner beast, but when others ruin his happiness, he extracts his violent and hairy revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Werewolf Woman' is not a very silly movie but it does pass itself off as a good public movie. You could have a fun time taking advantage of the bad performance / dubbing / translation and the simple fact of production. But by itself it moves slowly but has a wide nude to keep you awake just.
