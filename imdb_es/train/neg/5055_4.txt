Two years ago, at Sundance, I loved the debut in the direction of Josh Kornbluth: Haiku Tunnel. So he looked forward to his brother (and frequent contributor) Jacob's, The best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good child growing up in a lower class area of ​​New York. The film does not stop having its moving moments. But sometimes it's as if Kornbluth is working too hard to say the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle and more important is our understanding that despite all these somewhat abhorrent cultural foundations and the antisocial behavior they can generate, these characters have no shortage of kindness and humanity. We can go back in their language and their living conditions, but we can not rule out their intention. And, in fact, his struggle to support a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood and his compassion for people is evident in everything. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, The best thief in the world suffers from many painful failures (including the title). The characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the plot is barely perceptible. And for many the most disturbing thing is that Kornbluth uses two young blacks who imitate gangsta rap between scenes. To each one his own: but while I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see 5-year-old children talking and talking about having sex with an alignment of women. It is an unnecessary shock value and is a bit forced of borrowed interest.
