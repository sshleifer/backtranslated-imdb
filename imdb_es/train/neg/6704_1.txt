This is just a terrible 'comedy' - it really is a bad movie. There are no fun elements. No jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people can claim that this sad short film could be 'smarter' or 'quality'. Maybe if it's the only movie a person has seen, you can claim the brothers. but, I've seen thousands of better movies: namely, part six of leonard (now, that's funny). I do not know how siblings are considered eligible to be included in the Internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Jokes aside, just skip this movie. A root canal is more pleasant than this scruffy and clich√©-laden material.
