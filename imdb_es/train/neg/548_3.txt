I saw the rating of 7.5 of IMDb in this film and based on that I decided to see this movie that my roommate had rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," he said sharply. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies, this deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, this does not deserve more than a 3. Any movie in which I can guess what It will happen next. is not good for me The characters are incredible, how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are devised. It's too dramatic and the songs are not so good. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not entirely realistic. Any emotion or link between the characters that is the least subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more like a relationship between friends than between a father and his son, without having to transmit it through a five-minute song. The stupid comic relief complete with laughter was not funny or necessary (we got it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If a film tries to provoke tears through the most trite media possible, it just does not make sense, it's a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> In general, if someone has end-stage lung cancer, your child who lives with him would know that something was bad without being told. Too many plots to count. At first, the movie was funny and cute in the way that Bollywood movies are for people who do not see them so eagerly, but they became boring. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and touching, and the best way to do it is not to have all the funny parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartbreaking parts at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it took a little more depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than at the parts that were supposed to be fun. I did not spill a single tear or feel like it, but I was overwhelmed by the feeling of disgust at the attempt of a dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to see a Bollywood movie that is something sad.
