The movie begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars was not lost, but simply drifting into space near the planet. When he recovers, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a lot of very silly monsters. Interestingly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the dumbest I've seen in the movie. In addition, in a strange attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the movie look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed, it was SO bad! Despite all the cheese, the film had a rather interesting plot, as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it's worth seeing. For others, you may find the whole thing rather silly: check it and decide. <br /> <br /> While by today's standards this is not a good science fiction movie, compared to the films that are being made at that time, it accumulates quite well. <br /> <br /> PS: When you watch the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like the spit-up image of Dr. Quest from the "Jonny Quest" cartoon! Also, it sounds and looks a lot like him, too.
