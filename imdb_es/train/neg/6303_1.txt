I had high hopes for this movie. I found the premise interesting. I caught through it, although I found the show, except for Helena Bonham Carter, nothing special. I kept hoping that my time spent was worth it, but in the end I left wondering why they bothered to do this. Maybe in George Orwell's version there is a message that is worth transmitting. If this movie achieved anything, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe that his story could be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is "worth living the mundane life", well, they have achieved it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
