Do not be fooled to rent this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the title (in English). I can not think of anything good to say about the movie. Bad acting, bad editing, bad direction ... "argument" of laughter, and the sound / music was so irritating, it's a wonder that this movie does not come with a warning label. The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is because of its historical quality of cheese. They just do not make such bad movies anymore.
