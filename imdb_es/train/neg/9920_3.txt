I love the music of The Clash and the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie with the hope of learning about the man behind most of that. But I left the theater without knowing much more about Joe than I already knew after reading the Wikipedia entry. The film never reaches the person, their thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect the little material they had, the blurred and shaky videos and interview some people about Joe Strummer in a bonfire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or nothing, and that the director only wanted them in the film so that some other celebrities would say: "Oh, he was a great inspiration for all of us". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who apparently were asked to keep their pirate costume to benefit from their current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not even wait until the body cooled before jumping to sell his version of "the best punk rocker and hippie of heart" that ever existed, sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him. <Br /> <br /> Sure, being a fan I liked seeing the images of the band, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs and so on, but in the end I felt what was left as the portrait of Joe Strummer that could easily have been told in 60 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie if you're a fan, otherwise you'd better listen to music from The Clash or, better yet, the mescaleros, which of course Joe Strummer reached the peak of his development musical before his death, melting all his rich influences into one incredible sound.
