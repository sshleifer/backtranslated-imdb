I understand that this film is made for children and, as a mother, I have seen many films that do not particularly interest me, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view the way my children receive it. After all, it is assumed that parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment they see, so there should be something that attracts an adult audience of some level, even in children's movies . Disney has always understood this, so it is so difficult to understand how he could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear his name. <br /> <br /> Technically, the sound editing is horrible and all the dialogue sounds over bent and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was doubly horrible considering that the dialogue itself seemed to have been written by a 12-year-old boy for a school project. The "performance" reminded me of a school play and none of the children's actors had a range of emotion in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Now, before leaving like a geek in the videos that a children's movie with a rod for adults measures, the only thing that can save even the worst movie for children is a positive message. Far from me determine how to deliver a message while it is correct. Let's take a walk through this movie to see what messages are sent: <br /> <br /> If you're lost, do not worry, you'll inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Focus on wild animals without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" what you can. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the final message that remains in the film: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey the authority figures and do what you think is right.
