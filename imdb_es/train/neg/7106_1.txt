I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I've only seen a handful of them (and none of "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth"), but I can appreciate a scary horror movie, not a gore. And I'm pretty sure this is not scary. <br /> <br /> What is so creepy about a little plastic skull that appears everywhere? In all his appearances, there are very far establishing shots, so there is no real surprise in any of these movies. (Not that a skull in itself is so scary anyway, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's cousin cousin (John Hudson), who marries a kind of Donna-reed (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances in history) who begins to see skulls and hear the mysterious cries of a group of peacocks in her husband's mansion. Did I mention that your husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it. <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot about a rich guy trying to kill and / or drive his wife crazy. If you want to see a well-made version of this, try "Reversal of Fortune." And, by the way, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MST was fine, but it was nothing special; paired with the short "Gumby", however, makes it a good visualization. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; Eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, paraphrasing Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
