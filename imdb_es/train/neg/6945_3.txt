Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) kills his son and his wife is brutally attacked in an invasion of his home. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help you overcome post-traumatic stress. Then, Archer meets a man tied and gagged to a chair (Til Schweiger). He is told that this is the man who killed his son and attacked his wife and that he can do whatever he wants with him. And there is a wide variety of instruments to help you ... <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting at first (and shows real moderation in terms of blood and blood) but it gets stupider by the minute and has some possibilities very unlikely Trace twists and turns. Everything ends in a final turn that was so old and stupid that I was surprised that someone really thought of using it more. How talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer got involved in shit like this surpasses me. This gets three stars for the performance, but the stupid plot and the really incredible twists make this a task to sit on.
