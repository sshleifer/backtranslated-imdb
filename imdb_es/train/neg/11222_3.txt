Cybil Richards directs another masterpiece of erotica from Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in a rather attractive silver outfit) has the task of destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, he can not resist looking at the tapes and he likes them a little. The sex scenes are well filmed and have an excellent soundtrack (at least for this type of film). The cast is largely horrible and above all very average as well. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive personality and, upon seeing the sex files, she manages to expose her breast and rummage a little lower. She also fits into a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves much better than this kind of rate. Here she looks very well nude, but in reality she is much more attractive in her silver attire that narrates the "drama". Total garbage film with Lovell and the soundtrack, the only authentic characteristics exchangeable. Mediocre even for the production of Surrender and clearly a new low budget for them as well.
