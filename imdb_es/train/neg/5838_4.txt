With an absolutely incredible cast and crew, this could have been a classic. Instead, it is a repetitive paraphrase of all the 1979 conspiracy theories about the murder of JFK grafted, rather uselessly, into a vaguely incoherent plot about the assassination of the fictional president Kegan in 1960. Many actors of excellent characters are wasted as not given enough to do, such as Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or are asked to step over the top, John Huston. However, Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to acquit themselves very well, in very different ways. <br /> <br /> The photography is magnificent, but it does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of buying DVDs.
