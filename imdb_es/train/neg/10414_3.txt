This is an extremely silly and unseen movie about slavery in the West Indies and stars Puddy from the "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this artificial film and is noticeably thinner here. Oliver Reed got the highest turnover, but he's barely in the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it's funny to see all the young and horny wives of old rich people who ask him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays a brothel owner and they are a lot of nudity in the movie. If they are not drunken orgies in the brothel, then it is the young wives who have their turn with him. Then, of course, towards the end, the slaves rebel and there is the bloody confrontation. There is no real political message like the one in the movie "Burn", but just another device of artificial plot to advance the story. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast returned! I hope they have paid a lot of money because this first movie is pretty bad. The nudity keeps it visible and the lack of Warburton accent makes it sometimes laughable. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
