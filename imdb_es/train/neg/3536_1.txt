I think I've never been disappointed with a movie before. After loving the two previous films by Guy Ritchie (I do not count Swept Away, he was a bum), I really wanted to see this. <br /> <br /> The criticisms were bad, then, again, I do not trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the buzz on the Internet was that this was a bit stinky, so it was with a little fear that I delivered my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to try to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what was happening and, at one point, I honestly stood up and asked if it was only me who did not I understood <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself too seriously. It seems that he was not good enough to make movies with good storylines, laughs, quick dialogues and good characters. It's almost as if I had a checklist of the movies I wanted to cheat, here are some of the ones I noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... . <br /> <br /> I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the indulgent story and the editing / direction that allowed the filming down. <br /> <br /> So a big, big thumb down on me.
