I turn on the Club 700 from time to time and I only agree with some of the statements made. I am one of the many believers that most Christians consider liberal and conservative for the majority of non-Christians. I vote for my mind, and usually it is not representative. or dem. - I do not think the 700 club tells people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative environments. I think many people do not understand what is said in the 700 club. It bothers me to hear the name of one of the two addresses. I think 700 people in the club really love Jesus, but they are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they have forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did. Please, do not judge Jesus based on ignorant people who believe in Him and are not so ignorant with our comments about them. Why are people so important to each other?
