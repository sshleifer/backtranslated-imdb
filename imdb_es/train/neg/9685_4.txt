I do not know about you, but I've always been attracted to the 'ART' cinema. The first "artistic" film that I managed to get was "The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover" by Peter Greenaway, which left me perplexed by the creative and creative spirit. The film was the last paradox, beautiful and grotesque ... this was the "artistic cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with a purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in an asylum, and expressed art shows it for what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but especially those that entertain and have something to say, whether you agree with their position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN", is a dry subject, 'Comedy' clinic where father and son gather a harem to fulfill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what the previews suggested. The main focus of the film lies on the 'close' relationship between father and son, reunited after the death of the mother. In the first scenes of the film, the sadness of the parents is credible, you can feel their pain. What happens next is clear by Greenaway standards, the meeting of the harem, the observations about love and death, and the flesh shown for the sake of the flesh ... One could argue this, but I feel that the film is superficial and meaningless. And the idea that this could be a comedy baffles me. Acting for the most part if it's okay, ... especially good is Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should put her clothes back on). What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual touches of excess Greenaway that made it. Other movies so wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> While it is filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, "8 1/2 Women" is too simple to be considered an art, too insipid to be considered "fun", and simply too boring for worth it. <br /> <br /> Save money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
