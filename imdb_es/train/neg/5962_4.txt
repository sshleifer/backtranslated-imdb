Paul Naschy made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to go from pretty good trash to unassailable; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is only the average story of a sorcerer, magician or (as is the case here) a sorcerer, who is condemned to death, but not before swearing revenge against those who did it ... etc. one thing leads to the other and, very soon, the executed sorcerer is not good again. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film feels constantly meaningless. The characters skew reams of diatribe and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script and, if you ask me, I should continue acting because the dialogue is extremely trite and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides a boring address here, who likes dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes, movies like this have a certain charm; but Horror Rises from the Tomb does not even have that. This is a painfully boring movie that has little or no interest.
