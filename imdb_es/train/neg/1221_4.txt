I remember the days when Kim Basinger was just a pretty face that adorned movies with typical characters of silly Blondie, romantic interest or damsel in danger. But everything changed when she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent film LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one surprised by her solid performance. However, after that time, his career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the prestige that she gained thanks to that movie made her participate in moderately prestigious films (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we have never seen her again with an important character. The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her in that situation; and it's not just that his character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really horrible. The script of this movie could not be simpler and basic. However, Basinger gives a certain conviction to his character, and that makes him poor. Movie to earn some points. This movie is full of generic clich√©s and villains. The work of the director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons, but mainly because the film never has a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend While she was out. This movie commits the capital sin of being boring.
