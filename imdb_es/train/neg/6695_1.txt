I've had one thing with this Kari girl for a while, and as far as how she looked in this movie, I have no complaints. But after capturing it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: that's the only thing in the movie that is not below standards. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in another comment someone comment on how great the sex scenes were ... what? No way. When a movie is so bad, you'd better turn it into soft pornography, but instead, I see a doughy white guy who prevents me from seeing Wuhrer's body and the scenes that offer me nothing but a mockery. They should have gone to the movies so that the film was not a complete waste of time, but no. With such a horrible script, they should have taken advantage of Wuhrer's appearance, since he is the only professional in the film. 2/10, just because it looked so sexy.
