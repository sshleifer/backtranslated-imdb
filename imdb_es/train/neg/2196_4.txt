The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the most thoughtful low-budget exploitation films of the early sixties. It is very difficult to imagine how a script so repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are repeatedly expressed by the female protagonist, Ginny Leith, an independent head kept alive by machines, I-V and clamps, seem to confirm that the film was intended to simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes. Shadows of the undervalued Helena Boxing. <br /> <br /> Sexisms are plentiful and almost as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, dramatic and incredible, and the performance is simply correct (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thought clearly entered into it. I'm not really sure at what point I was trying to get the movie, but it seems clear that it strives to achieve an unusually disturbing and raw horror (without the blood and guts the audience expects). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are no heroes in this movie, and none of the characters are particularly nice. <br /> <br /> Considered everyone, this is a very painful and disturbing look. American pop sexuality of the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman kept alive despite her lost body after what should have been a fatal car accident. Her lover is threatening to sew her a fresh and high quality body and force her to continue living with him. It is understandable that she does not feel upset about all this and that she is forced to make friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the clich√© of the fifties and sixties about the evils of science that are unleashed. <br /> <br /> Recommended for science fiction fans and graduate students in gender studies. O / w is not recommended.
