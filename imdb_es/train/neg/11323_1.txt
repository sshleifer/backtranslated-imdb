This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It is incredible that anyone thinks that this film deserves the time and the investment to make it. I have seen "B" movies before, but the "C" movie has just been invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy the Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching, but I found myself looking for the videos of "Caballeros" for fifteen minutes. The high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should delete it from their curriculum. Shame is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies, even turned it off. Now that has to really tell you something. If you see this movie, and you like it, I will pray for you.
