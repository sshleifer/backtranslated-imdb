Do you know when you look at your collection of old movies recorded on video and you realize that there are some that you have only seen once or twice, and you can not remember if they are worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is / was one of those movies; I found it, not long ago, and I decided that I could also give it a try. I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape ... yes, you understand. The plot is predictable and in no way original. The rhythm is bad. The acting is bad, but that's not really surprising, since the two protagonists are former telenovela stars ... they're used to exaggerating. The characters are badly written clichés. The movie even manages to ruin the damn easiest way to impress me (through the movie): cut scenes. Even those that do not provoke a single emotion for or against any of the thin cardboard characters. The film simply does not have real redeeming qualities at all ... even dialogue is bad. The point is that it is so full of clichés that it is ridiculous. And that's the only thing that raises this above a 1/10 rating: the comic relief (though not intentionally) of the many clichés and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the movie, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One final note: I considered using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as a summary of a line, but I think that everyone knows, so I opted for the current one, since it is more informative. In short, a totally bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it is on television. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it. 3/10
