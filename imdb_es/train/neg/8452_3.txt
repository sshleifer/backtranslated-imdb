This is the first time I comment on a film because I felt that if the right person read it, they could wake up and do something about it. In recent months, ABC Family began broadcasting a new movie format. I have seen the last three and I have enjoyed them. They were engaged and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I really wanted to see "See Jane Date". The trailers looked and sounded very good. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book should be light years away from the effort shown by the writers and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. It worked against that. I work in the film and television business. I like to have fun. This is a case in which I kept thinking that it could get worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know that these women can act but you would not know about this movie. To add to the overall experience, the ending left me shaking my head. A tip for the executives of Disney, ABC, ABC Family and the producers: under no circumstances, do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of his future films. They have lost their touch and need to understand what the word "contemporary", "present" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world that happens to you. In general, it was a big disappointment for the people of Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
