Can any movie become more naive than this? You can not believe a piece of this script. and it is very foreseeable that you can see the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. the main actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she does not make it, the doll has MORE acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease with which the character passes and remains in a music school makes the ghost of the opera novel look like a historical biography. I'm not even going to comment on the superficiality of the characters, but the ONLY thing in the film is Madsen's performance that manages to give life to a one-dimensional character similar to a melo. <br /> <br /> The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. I can think that some girls obsessed with 13-year-old Britney shout "Oh, give us a break! If we want fairy tales, there's always a Grimm Brothers book hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave him 2 instead of just one for Virginia Madsen.
