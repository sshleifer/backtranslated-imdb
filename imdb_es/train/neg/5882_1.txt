I'm not sure why this movie was promoted as a wild comedy, quirky and full of laughs. There is not much in this movie that entertains, or entertains the viewer. Annette Bening (whose performance was promoted as Oscar-worthy) appears here as a moderator, and her performance seems routine. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and irritating, and is the protagonist Augusten? Jose cross ?? It seems that he simply does not have the personality to play his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but she is not enough to back this boring and nasty movie. <br /> <br /> The movie disappeared quickly and it seems that with good reason. I found some of the unpleasant scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and his only uses toilets in the bathroom, some of the worst scenes in "You and me and All we know" and "The squid and the whale"), some shameful, and most of them disturb you. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Do not waste your time?
