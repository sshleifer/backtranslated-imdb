I doubt it's ever a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much from this movie and I got even less. What could have been smart and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that Gram did and it had more filling than cheap dog food. There was no record of Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters that were shown were not familiar to me even as fans of Gram and all the versions of their "adventures of the beyond" that I have heard. Rock and roll is full of stories, good too, but they should be taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories although exaggerated. However, this movie took a good story and became gut. Stealing any corpse and the resulting implications should never be a boring story, but somehow they made it boring. I am tempted to steal each copy of Grand Theft Parsons, head to the desert and burn them all.
