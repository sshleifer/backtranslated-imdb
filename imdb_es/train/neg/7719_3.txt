The easiest way to describe this movie is like a satire. The objective of the satire is quite vast, from the US government. UU Until the corporate America. Nor is it a sharp satire, but rather silly. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a cross between the Kentucky Fried movie, the Airplane series and the Police Squad, made on a much smaller budget and not as funny. I can see how this movie is a satire of many science fiction movies of disasters of the 50s and 60s. I see this movie as a great influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. The genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. At first there is a cover-up and then it becomes a full-fledged war. <br /> <br /> The film covers the full range of characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (a clone of Lois Lane), a very ambitious president. The press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (agent of the FIA ​​who has not worked from the Bay of Pigs), a useless president (who seems to only be able to sign his name and attack New York), an even inept Congress, a sleazy CEO of marketing, and Mason's team consists of an obese female "swimmer" from East Germany, a diver, a crazed World War II paratrooper and an African-American costume expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally like a tomato). Did I forget to mention, too many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, broken tomatoes, tomato juice and, finally, people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> Besides all this, it has a couple of musical numbers too. They are not so good and they seem to be bent. The best song is, by far, the theme of the movie ("The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's too catchy and you could end up humming or singing it in public. Be careful. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is quite funny and shows the absurdity of several real-life situations, as well as various entertainment genres. I do not think I was induced to laugh, but mostly I smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of the B and C movies, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -cellulosic rehabilitation
