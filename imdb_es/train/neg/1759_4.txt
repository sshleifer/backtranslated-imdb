This effort was like a dazzling television movie ... I do not remember that it has ever been released in theaters ... If so, it must have died like a quick death. When watching the DVD, in the comfort of our room, it was obvious that this movie was not for much more ... Ed Lauter, an art critic with a streak of greed? What a funny turn it must have been ... I have not seen Ed from "The Longest Yard" ... All the others performed quite well by the numbers, led by Baldwin, except Pompeo ... She did not have charisma. and he seemed to be sleepwalking in most of the image ... Pompeo's daughter had a dimension ... she interpreted all the scenes as an adorable puppy ... the slower delivery of all the 3-year-olds I've had still seen ... <br /> <br /> The chase scenes caused headaches for my wife and me ... too fast and angle of attack ... If you are going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, You may want a bit of WIDTH shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop, right? The whole story was quite unlikely and crazy, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
