I usually support independent art and I try to be very understanding and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are worth ... <br /> <br /> but this film simply moves away from all understanding and tolerance. limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have seen in your life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. think of a fantastic and attractive ART for the DVD box of that movie ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! You have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> Go alone if you really do not have anything better to do. Anything is better.
