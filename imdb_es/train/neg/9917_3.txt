When Stanwyck's future husband is killed on the eve of their wedding, she retires to a mountain shelter, where she slips (more or less) off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a definitely unilateral marriage, spent on a huge farm in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to rush to Cortez, but finally returns to Morgan, in a very tenuous and unconvincing story resolution. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandering and seems useless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but in the end I was disappointed. It's still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes the movies of the thirties.
