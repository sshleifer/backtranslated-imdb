The best contender for the worst movie ever made. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have an I.Q. of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director. The script would not have happened in a high school writing class; the "jokes" are juveniles; the corny concept These artists were obviously desperate to work. I stayed until the end just to see if it got worse. Did. Life is too short to spend a part of it watching this movie.
