This movie had a pretty good plot, but the pasta was very slow ... very slow. Even if someone thinks that this is a cult classic, I think there are much better films from that era to be seen. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is not excellent, but neither is it the worst. the sounds are well illuminated OK. <br /> <br /> I would still not recommend this to anyone other than maybe a film student. <br /> <br /> The film does not contain music, and horses that have sex do not. It does not make a good one either. and the woman who masturbates on the edge of the bed was stupid. <br /> <br /> There are no gains here, skip this absolute boredom. I've seen myself worse, believe me, but this is just a waste of time, and I do not get the good reviews here. especially the high grades ...
