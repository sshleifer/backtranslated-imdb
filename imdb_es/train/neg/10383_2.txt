This may be one of the most enjoyable movies in history if you do not take it seriously. It's a little outdated and the effects are scarce, but it's very nice. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It is incredibly bad. And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the film, is horribly amazing. It's predictable, but watching the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat. Do not even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she looks naked. It's not worth putting up with your daughter, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Did I mention that there are giant crabs?
