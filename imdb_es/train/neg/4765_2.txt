While the original stimulates the intellect, this cheap remake is designed purely to impact sensibilities. Instead of intricate twists in the plot, this so-called thriller only presents sudden and seemingly random changes in the story that only serve to degrade it further with each strange development. The worst of all is that replacing the original spicy dialogue is an overturned saltcellar full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving an austere but uninteresting flavor. <br /> <br /> There was a promise, an unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine taking a Keller-a-Sullivan graduation like Patty Duke's is certainly intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation, first accepting the role in this horribly rewritten nonsense and then presenting a performance that only seems competent when compared to the amateur overacting of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the classic original, ignore its outdated visuals and tricks. Look for it, look at it and enjoy a story and a half. As for the remake, this insult passes to the original.
