Desperately inept and boring movie in which the characters stand in rooms or on a rocket and talk endlessly. I would think that things would be animated when they explore Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very murky. The landscape / vegetation of Mars is composed mainly of drawings and the monsters are totally unconvincing. There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine carefully rolls the octopus like tentacle of a carnivorous plant around it before it flutters weakly, the difference is that Ed Wood's film is a hundred times more entertaining. It is better to use earplugs when, otherwise, the "science fiction" music, which repeats itself incessantly, will drive you crazy. If you feel unable to sleep one night, simply insert it into the VCR and your insomnia will heal in no time.
