When the 2000s came to an end, the adopted daughter of King Kong came forward and made a tearful announcement that her program was coming to an end. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was crying, I laughed and screamed like a savage. Indian of the old west. <br /> <br /> So, what does Oprah do? She takes famous people, and puts them in her program. What kind of famous people? people who have suffered (like her, except that these people have lost more than her virginity) have suffered melted faces (real story), lost members (true story, see the end of the paragraph) and spousal abuse (too many to count). and somehow enter the program and tell their story, as if we had not heard it before tons and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing an arm to a shark since the first day, which was October 31, 2003 Do not tell me you do not have resentment.) But probably the most important thing in the Michael Jackson interview was in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has already passed away. but that particular program told about Michael's personal life, something that not many people knew at that time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. They seem to think that she is like a personal Jesus sometimes. but everything I see in Oprah is a great lady in the ghetto who made it great, and she is only showing how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that your programs end soon. We need better television programs.
