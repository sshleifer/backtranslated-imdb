Very disappointing movie. In the end I did not care about any of the characters. I really enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was fine as always, but it's not worth seeing. It starts strong and continues to be weaker and weaker. The insomniacs will like it since I'm sure it will put them to sleep.
