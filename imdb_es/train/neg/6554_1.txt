I would not give a rating to this movie, it's not worthy. I saw it only because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and take care of everything she did. Even in this failure, she did not disappoint. Each scene with her in it, kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing ever happened. He had some good stories, but they ended abruptly as soon as he started. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing became that. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 years old when he made this film and at its most charming moment. The costumes and the set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can see almost everything and I rarely find a movie that I can not find something I like, but this was a failure. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, I had a big hanger on the cliff at the end. I had a final scene that woke you up and said: wow, this movie is finally going somewhere, and then the credits start. Good grief <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and seeing my cat eat would have been more exciting. Well said. Actually, that comment was more entertaining than the movie because it sums it up very well. I also wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
