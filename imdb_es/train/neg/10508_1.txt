I thought that the nadir of the horror movie had been reached with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This film makes it look like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" in comparison to this piece of shameless and unpurged fecal matter that has the audacity to be called a movie. I would write more, but I'm still very angry because I was stupid enough to spend Â£ 3 to rent them, reels. <br /> <br /> And these people were English? and where is the forest? I have lived in the United Kingdom for two thirds of my life and, as far as I know, there are no dark and unexplored forests in the central region. The whole Bally thing looked like a conifer plantation of national trust. Those angels looked like anorexic porn stars (most of them turned around, I did my research). However, I liked the part where Judd broke into pieces. <br /> <br /> P.S I love and admire Tom Savini, but THEY CAN NOT ACT
