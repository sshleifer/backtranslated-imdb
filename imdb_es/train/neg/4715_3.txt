Recently he had been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in him. I failed, horribly. Cartoon Network generally has a tendency to make its programs enjoyable for all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the gags that run are not much gags at all. Kids will love it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Now, this does not mean that everything is bad. The original opening theme was actually quite sticky, but for some reason they took the skeleton and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame, because that was really one of the best things I had done. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. On the other hand, this makes it easy for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit too fast too. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for intelligent writing. This is a real shame, because there are many interesting concepts that the program presents. However, on the rise, the accelerated pace will prevent children from losing interest, and that is really the totality of the target audience. <br /> <br /> In general, the program looks very good on paper, but it is not like that. be successful in being funny or interesting This is a show that I want to like, but I am unable to do it. There is so much potential that is not realized. Children will enjoy it, but that's it.
