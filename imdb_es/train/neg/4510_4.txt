I love the Memoirs of a Geisha, so I read the book twice; It's one of the best books I've read last year. I really wanted to see the movie and I was afraid that reading the book would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Part of the best part of the book was omitted from the film and the characters were weak and Hatsumomo (Li Gong) was the worst. If I had not read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The outline of the plot of the film says "Nitta Sayuri reveals how her fishing transcended ..." Did someone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget about the movie and read the book.
