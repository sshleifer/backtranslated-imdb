The Wimpy plush shirt, Armand Louque (played softly by veteran actor Dean Jagger in a rare leading role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls in love with the charming Claire Duval (who goes to find the blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the meek to get Armand's colleague, Clifford Grayson (the irredeemably sturdy Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious at being used and rejected by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to avenge himself. It sounds exciting? Well, it sure is not. To begin with, Victor Halperin's static (no) address allows the meandering, carefree story full of conversations to proceed at an unbearably slow pace. Worse still, Halperin fails to bring tension, atmosphere or impulse to the horribly tedious procedures. Most blah that act from a largely insipid cast do not help at all; only George Cleveland as the cordial General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to cheer things up a bit with his welcome and refreshing histrionics. The score of the movie library, the painfully obvious sets of the stage and the gross cinematography are also pretty bad and unimpressive. In fact, this feeble excuse for a characteristic of fear is so unpleasant that not even the eyes of the great Bela Lugosi that have not been accredited can alleviate the boredom that numbs the brain. An unfortunate boredom.
