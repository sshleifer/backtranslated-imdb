Ben, a policeman from out of town, is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring his killer to justice, but Stefan approaches him and believes his sister was the victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> This is something incredibly horrible and I wondered how he was released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, since this has been his worst performance I've seen. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes with this really cheap movie, which goes from the hammy and wood performances of Annie. McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee), the cheesy fashion (those sunnies), the cheap and lame special effects, the misuse of lighting, humor ... if there were any , music of the 80s. (with part of the film focused only on playing in an unknown band), the werewolf has orgies that is a sight worth seeing and a boring story with a flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was that bad it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positive thing was that the location and configuration of the film looked great, but that's it ... I will actually add Sybil Danning to the strip scene as well. <br /> <br /> During the final credits of the band they play their crap-house song during a strange montage of scenes from the film, in which I wonder why. <br /> <br /> A terrible disorder, however, at least it is not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
