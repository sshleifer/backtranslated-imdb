If you do not mind playing with your emotions, then you will not mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy the mysteries of British crime, by following the clues and seeing how all of them fit logically in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> These are some of the logical inconsistencies that led to that disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police used the CCTV cameras from the beginning to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the view of children just before his disappearance does not tangle camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It is inconsistent to have the car in which the children were trapped with the camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film does everything possible to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking. movements of children, but loses the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment, is tracking vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from visible locations with cameras adjacent to the crime scene as part of the development of tracks. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car in the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when he could have easily parked immediately behind, or even to one side; as the huge truck did. <br /> <br /> * The forensic police team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer several miles from the crime scene, but can not find any blood tests. from the wound in the head right at the scene of the crime, although they secured the scene just a few hours after the disappearance and without intermediate rains. <br /> <br /> * The search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; This is from the country that is well known for the development of the hunting dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such a publicized news does not present the alleged innocent truck driver who stopped at the flower kiosk. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical for the mother to go to such extremes and devote so much effort to leaving clues of carpet fiber under her nails for her eventual investigators of murders, even convincing her daughter to do the job . The same ... while she simply could not have left the mobile home unguarded. If she had enough sense of her to ask her daughter to put carpet fibers under her nails, she could ask her daughter to ask for help or even to leave the mobile home in a crowded residential park. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect who abducted the little girl was described as mentally slow / dumb - justifying her unconscious drowning of the mother? but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to incriminate himself. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to the disappointment of a real detective fan. 'Five Days' is a very weak British criminal history.
