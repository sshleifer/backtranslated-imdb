Shintar√¥ Katsu won tons of fame playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and incredible concept: a blind man is the best swordsman in Japan and he passes each film correcting mistakes and demanding retribution from the evildoers. He is a good boy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I have seen all the movies). This is why I saw this last installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, since I assumed it would be very similar ... and I was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo's films are extremely sexual in nature and also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a policeman of the Meiji period and regularly takes the wicked women into custody and interrogates them by raping them with his "steel penis". How he made his member so strong is something he has to see to believe, but it is certainly NOT for the apprehensive. <br /> <br /> In general, I simply can not recommend that anyone see these violent and misogynistic films. However, when looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and that is quite scary. Despite decent acting and incredible fighting scenes, movies are like brain pollution, and I would like to imagine how movies could have contributed to violence against women.
