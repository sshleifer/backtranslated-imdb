Trusting the previous positive comments, we saw a free projection of this last night. Now I KNOW that the filmmakers raise positive criticism, because there is no way that an objective person could have written this. "Destined to become a 'cult classic'"? The theater was full, apparently with friends and family members of the production team, because only some of us left at the first hour. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal I've heard in a musical. ?? "Do not take the shortcut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ..." Debi Mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the melodies lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever plays the wolf in this story should be charming and seductive. Instead, we have Joey Fatone, ex-N'Syncer, who lives up to his last name, since he has not aged well. He's not exactly nimble with his extra 50 pounds and his high school quality makeup and his singing out of tune. Seriously, this guy was in a vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-suitable, but they can not do much about the script without imagination. You know, is it possible to write for adults and children at the same time? see in "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual sets looked good and were well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash."
