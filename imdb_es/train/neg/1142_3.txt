My harsh statements about the "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" movies have been the object of faults and blows! Now another race comes in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies! Many of these that I have seen before, and let me tell you, are not all that was believed! Usually, do not stick to the point. This, among all the others, has no originality! What does a ninja have to do with the prevention of a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And is not this supposed to be also a "martial arts" movie? Do you sound many shots like an incredible action movie? Is blood the number one reason to love this until death? Will you lose some of your hard earned money with a woman who sings in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For an even more absurd ninja fun, try watching the Godfrey Ho movies published by Trans World. You get what you deserve, and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
