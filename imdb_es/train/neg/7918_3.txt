The writing in this movie seemed absolutely terrible to me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film from me when I rated it as 1 out of 10 was the performance of Lacy Chabert, which I think played very well for the many personalities. For me, she was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was pretty as always, but I found her role rather insipid, so I do not think you can say her performance was excellent. <Br /> <br /> Regarding the male protagonist, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of the doctors of the hospital series of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Everything with what could have been vivid. However, the end / the terrible, terrible, terrible solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of the psychic were just some of the worst writings I have seen in a long time.
