I read James Hawes' book. It was pretty clean, not great, but entertaining enough. Without having read the book, I would not have had the slightest idea of ​​what was happening, and yet it was an effort with that knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally, every element of this movie is abysmal in ways that I do not. Have the ability to describe. Half digested fish could have made a better film with matches and lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since, since a movie made me feel so angry. The aftermath of the mattress got closer, but they never even reached as deep a depth of frightful and nauseating putrefaction as did this bilge. <br /> <br /> Since I lost 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague in the human class, now I can not even look at any James Hawes book without feeling angry. That is the depth of the hatred I have for this piece of shit. No, that's unfair. Allow me to apologize for any fecal matter for comparing it to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Simple and simply a cancer in the world of cinema.
