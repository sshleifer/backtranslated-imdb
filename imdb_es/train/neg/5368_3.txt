Private practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in medical histories. Just looking at House, "I solved" two (of nine) medical mysteries before doctors. Assault Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy some cases of older ER episodes or some dark Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular: it's hard to get rid of your ideas ... <br /> <br /> The second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? So, why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? The three weeks (that is, three whole episodes) of intense thinking are really necessary to understand that if your best friend does not want to be your "friend with benefits", it may not be because he wants to hurt you, but because he does not. Do not you want to risk your friendship? The character who thinks everything is a psychiatrist, by the way, the whole story is so unrealistic that you can not really accept the supposed "drama". <br /> <br /> And I'm not even going to start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison when we met her at Gray's Anatomy ... On a side note, you do not find the way funny in which Addison ends up wishing the loser Pete (sorry, but all those who try to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, doctor or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with the tearful and irritating Meredith miles away in the rainy Seattle? Apart from that little adventure with Mark, they seemed perfect for each other. Sometimes I think that Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is usually the right one ...
