What does the "executive producer" do in a movie? If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised the financial support to make the film. In a lot of movies starring Sean Connery, it can be noticed that he is also the executive producer, which means that Connery raised the money since he is an important player. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that a lot of films "starring Sean Connery were made only because he managed to raise money since he is a major Hollywood player, it is usually an indication that when the credits say that the executive producer and the star of the film are one and the same, the film itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story / script that is not up to scratch <br /> <br /> The PROTOCOL follows the saga of Sunny Davis, a crazy bimboesca cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and, as a reward, becomes a top-level diplomat.Likely? As things progress, Ms. Davis (who has trouble joining two sentences) He finds himself in more extravagant and less likely situations, when I say that the PROTOCOL is starring Goldie Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the film, do you understand what I am saying? erca that the story / script is not up to it? Exactly
