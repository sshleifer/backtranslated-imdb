I found this movie to be a total disappointment. The talent available to the director, especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (not to mention the four main characters) has been completely lost in a mediocre and ungraceful story, whose conclusion did not matter once. Introduced to terrible characters, stereo type. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is simply annoying (she seems to repeat her role from high fidelity, less humor), Crystal plays with her same old hyperactive, neurotic and annoying ego, and Cusack simply walks on his own, apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, much less the chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS) Well, the only moments of mild humor emerged from the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin, the screenwriter obviously can not show any originality at all. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably funny when the Mexican lover and Walken made a funny twist as a parody of an Arthouse-Maverick-Dogme type director, but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) treated us with Billy Crystal having his groin broken by a dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of most of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, a film with many good ideas completely disappointed me, and at the same time, I was not willing to explore or elaborate on any of them, but resort to the same clich√©s of the same genre and even stoop to the depths of the almost 'rude humor, of films for teenagers' sometimes. <br /> <br /> A very poor 4/10.
