... Ok, I read about this movie somewhere on the Internet, and many criticized how bad this movie is. And I could not have agreed more about it. Then, after watching this movie on DVD, I thought twice and then went commercial of this film on TV. Fortunately, I saved my money for this garbage. They sacrificed my dreams for this movie and it soon turned out that this movie could not satisfy me. So I can not judge how the movie was made, but anyway ... it still stinks. As for those who liked this movie, I would apologize for blowing up this movie and telling you how bad this movie is. I do not know what you think about this movie?
