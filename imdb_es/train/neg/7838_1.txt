This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of the party of the five took it and turned it into a television. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, writing and basically everything else. The movie had some of the worst writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely needed to be interesting. I know that vh 1 has become a household name for your music shows. which are much better than all this would have worked if it had been an episode behind the music, but it was not like that, and it will feel flat on your face.
