This movie is really terrible. It is terrible as in a waste of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. The performance was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It is a crocodile that attacks tourists while filming a documentary about "blood surfing". Blood surfing is when you surf around sharks, but they become terribly wrong when a 31-foot crocodile interrupts your vacation. Sharks do not seem real. The crocodile is even worse, and it becomes even more pathetic when they run away from the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females throw it. The deaths are false and the pirates are just to complete the time. <br /> <br /> A meaningless and terrible movie that is not worth seeing!
