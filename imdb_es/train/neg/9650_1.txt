Maaan, where do I start with this horrible movie of God? Bad bad bad story that counts. I do not know what the director thought when he made this movie. To be honest, Namaste London was a very nice movie ... even the soundtrack was good. But in this ... oh, my good ... for a movie that is supposed to be a musical ... the songs are so bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /> <br /> Given two great actors, the director should have done a much better job. Although the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie are fine. The Salman and Ajay presentations prevent the film from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you have nothing better to do. The last good Bollywood movie that I saw (and I do see a lot of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
