Make a decision Personally I found it as fun as receiving a lumbar puncture from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I thought it was stupid. They are not exactly the first two options to take care of your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two sellers of energy drinks, to avoid time in jail are ordered by the court to guide two children from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth grade student who speaks poorly and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man who plays in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with his analogies of dry wit. The following are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
