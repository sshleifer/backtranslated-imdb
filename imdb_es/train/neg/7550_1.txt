Okay, I'm an original Wicker Man fan and, generally, I do not like British films remade by Americans, why, oh, why did I submit to the most painful cinematic experiences in history? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and maybe I had some kind of madness. The movie was frightening! The drill bit at the beginning with the crash / fire had no relevance to the film and the police knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the continent, well, it would not have happened as All this would have been investigated. The story behind the wicker man was not really explored, and I think being set in the United States really did not help the whole pagan theme. This movie was slow and did not contain atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best was at the end, when Nicolas Cage burns down. I have such a desperate need to see the original again now, to cleanse my disappointed soul. I can not really emphasize how disappointing this film is, please do not see it if: <br /> <br /> A) I do not like the American reissues of British Films B) He is a fan of the original film. C) I hate Nicolas Cage
