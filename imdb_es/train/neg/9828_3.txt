I rented this by mistake. I thought, after a brief examination of the box, that it was a science fiction story and time travel. On the other hand, it is a "Christian" story, and I suppose it is a typical example. If it is sold to you in the message, you will probably overlook the discomfort of the plot / performance / etc, but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that it bothers me the rewriting of the story in this story. He painted the 1890s as a kind of paradise of family and moral values ​​(a character is horrified because 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But overlooks the unpleasant aspects of this "highly moral" society (racial , sexual and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point, the hero complains to the owner of a clothing store about things that do not sound so different to the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought, I guess it's the kind of thing you'll like if you like this kind of thing, and it's certainly healthy ...
