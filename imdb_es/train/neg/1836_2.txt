How can Barry Levinson bring together the talents of the red-hot comedy Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the beautiful Rachel Weisz, the former professional Christopher Walken and still offer a stinky humorist? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the latter Invent a spray to make the dog's mess go away and become a conspicuous and consumed billionaire. <br /> <br /> The venue is thin but healthy enough to have been a springboard for some great criticism between the two stars, but all concerned exaggerate every hand, whenever they can. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are just not funny for a long time, Weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underutilized and, with the exception of Walken. Like a crazy barfly that incites the Stiller character to take revenge, it's a turgid journey to the end of this tense farce.
