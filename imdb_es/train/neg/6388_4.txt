The Brothers Quay are directors, judging from conventional thinking, they should have limited themselves to making short films. I myself really liked his first feature film, Instituto Benjamenta, but judging by his second effort, El Afinador de piano de los terremotos, I agree that they are not close to matching his past genius in the length of the feature film. Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a magnificent movie to watch and, often, to listen to. Unfortunately, it is a bit painful to sit down with your convoluted narrative and its glacial rhythm. Reading the synopsis of the plot, sounds like a pretty good story. But the Brothers fail miserably to give it life. One thing you should consider completely avoiding in the future: dialogue. My God, it's horrible here. A huge bust.
