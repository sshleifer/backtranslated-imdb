My grandmother and my sister took us to see this movie when it opened in theaters in 1998, so we bought tickets, popcorn and soda, and went directly to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not clap loudly, I remember hearing some people say they did not like anything, I did not like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and it was not worth it. seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical about this, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts in this, I also remembered that the other people in the theater almost did not laugh. And what I really thought was bad was to make the animals talk, because the animals that speak only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a stray dog! I said that, apart from the hysterical touch of Eddie Murphy that he brings, this movie is not worth seeing, it's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in several of the movies and I thought it was fun in Esas, I just said that he was the only fun part of this movie, I have not seen Eddie Murphy in the movie either. "Great", The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie that I really recommend you watch, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like this, especially because of the many animals that talk about it! <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a 3 star rating out of 10 possible.
