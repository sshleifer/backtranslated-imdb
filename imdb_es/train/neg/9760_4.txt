The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so it dominated the filming of the Israeli side. I was impressed by the almost completely opposite views of mothers. The Israeli mother lost a son who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the possibility of a life of deprivation and despair. With completely different views, any meeting had no real possibility of meeting with the minds. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each one of them. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for the Israelis was security. With such a chasm, is this kind of film really worth it? I ended up with the feeling that I had seen nonsense propaganda, both parties were not convincing.
