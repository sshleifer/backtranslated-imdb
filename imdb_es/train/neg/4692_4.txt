The first time I saw this movie, it was titled TERROR IN A TRAIN and it was the back half of a double feature. Glenn Ford, an expert in armament, is called to deactivate a hidden bomb in a train loaded with explosives. The tension is slow and constant; and this black and white film lasts about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; Tension and drama have lost most of their impact. This is still a good movie when it comes to the standards of the early 50s. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
