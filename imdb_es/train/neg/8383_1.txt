...Forever. This is the background. I'm not kidding. The theater should have had some kind of warning. "Abandon all hope that you enter here" would have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have the words to accurately describe the hell this film is. His debilitating stupidity does not even manage to entertain. This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slowest turtles in the sandbox. The story was shamelessly stolen from a 10-minute Bugs Bunny caricature and then spread like Mr. Fantastic to 90 awful painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Wayans were fun. I suppose that the pressures of Hollywood to produce products are the culprits of the poop that occurs at a constant rate. I'm sad and offended because they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-balls jokes with a thin story based on a caricature. <br /> <br /> I did not like almost everything about this movie. I will not ruin anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wayans badly superimposed on the body of the dwarf. What I did was the end. Not the resolution of the film, but the real ending where we all stood up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it clearly deserves less. I do not feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script are worth a star. This deserves a Razzie and I ask God to get it. <br /> <br /> When will people learn? If you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop shitting it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
