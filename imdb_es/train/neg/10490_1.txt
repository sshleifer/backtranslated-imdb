I noticed that the previous critic (who still seems to be in school) gave this film a very good critique and I can only assume that this is because the critic has not seen the very superior adaptation of this classic novel to the BBC in 1989 The main problem I had with this version (1999) was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who shot to fame after appearing in the television miniseries "The Choir". I can only assume that he was chosen for the role of Tom Long for the strength of his excellent performance in "The Choir." Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" had become a tall and moody young man when "Tom Midnight Garden" was filmed and, as such, Anthony does not manage to convince him as schoolboy Tom. It is too much of an exaggeration to believe that Tom (played by Anthony) would become friends with Hatty, who is much younger. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty have a much closer age and the development of their friendship is much more credible. For a 1999 film, even special effects fail to convince and there is no noticeable improvement in the effects of 1989 television. The casting and performance of this version are inferior to the previous adaptation and, in general, the film was a dull version of a true classic. As a final remark, I would like to point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version reaches more than £ 20.00 second hand, while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than £ 5.00, should I say more?
