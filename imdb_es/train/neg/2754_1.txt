My original review of this film was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times more. Although it was a very accurate critique, I felt that my criticism should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress; Your facial expression does not change once in this movie, it does not show fear, happiness or depression. His abilities in body language are reduced to throwing his eyes to the left and to the right and looking as if he did not know Jack. She is a emotionless husk that I suppose has had too much botox. However, their lack of facial expression throughout the film is surpassed by the deplorable love story with the main actor, who seems to emerge from nowhere and makes them go out to the beach and fall in love within a couple of hours after meet. The main actor, whose hair demands more attention than he was, was mediocre at best and did not make me feel as if I were really in danger once. <br /> <br /> The only thing that surpasses the horrible performance is the direction. , argument and inaccuracies in the plot. I've seen ads for tampons with more structure than this movie. There is no development in the character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe that a real person would do. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if I tried to be a shit on purpose, like Snakes on a plane, but I was trying to be a serious action movie that I could not even laugh at. I think I now have a brain tumor when I watch this movie and think about the different ways that I could have used that budget and the CG team to create something far superior. If you bought this on a DVD, it would break the DVD into pieces, burn it and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid just in case. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
