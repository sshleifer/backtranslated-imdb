Why is it that any film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in the movie? Whatever the attraction that the woman had for the greatest Roman of all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to appear on the screen as anything other than the pranks of oversexed high school seniors. Despite the splendid sets and costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian extravaganza of "sandals and togas" of the 50s. It is true that this type of spectacular belongs to the big screen, which is why "Gladiator" came out well, but "Gladiator" did not have the whole romantic novel of sex. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has as little talent as an actress as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has plenty of talent. Too bad some of them did not wash in others.
