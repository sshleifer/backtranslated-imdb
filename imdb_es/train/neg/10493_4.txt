A film difficult to categorize. I was never giving him 110% concentration and, therefore, as simple as the plot appeared, I could not say with certainty who was doing what among the American FBI characters and what their roles were. Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as characters in the film when their lines and scenes were in the style of one of their unrepresented programs. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV. show, with a largely insignificant sub-plot in progress, that just seems to be on the way. However, as any Irwin show is always worth seeing, this movie is also worth seeing, but not on Christmas Day. Speaking of which, I have better things to do than be here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
