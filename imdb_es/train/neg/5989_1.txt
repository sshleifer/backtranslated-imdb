wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. I can not believe I wasted my time. The performance is, at best, worthy of punishment and the special effects are raw. Probarly is the worst script in history, some extremely embarrassing quotes that I've heard in my life. I swear to God that 'sweep' is better than this. Madonna should have won and Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life I want to return. Honestly, people do not see this, even young children consider this movie an insult to their intelligence. I found this film very strange in the fact that it was difficult to say who is more wooden, these guys here of the real puppets. Please, guys, do not waste your time on this movie, you will live to regret it.
