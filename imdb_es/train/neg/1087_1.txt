This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. While it has good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic aspect of this film is music, which sums up the film quite well: to compensate for a bad and confusing story by having good known actors, high and dramatic music. It does not change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. He got a score of 1.
