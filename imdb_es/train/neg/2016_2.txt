***** Warning: may contain SPOILERS ********* My HUGE problem with this movie is the totally self-centered and self-consumed that is the adulterous wife! After having an affair one night with a psychopath, she is being harassed by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends her a video of their night together. Obviously he is crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks that he is dangerous to HER (and expose her secret). Not for a second did she think of worrying about her husband! Did she think, for a moment, that he could be in danger because of this psychotic? As soon as she realized how mental she was, she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences. Maybe there would not be a movie at the time, but there really was not one, so what's the difference?
