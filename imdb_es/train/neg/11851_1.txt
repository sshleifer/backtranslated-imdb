This was a disappointment, none of the nuances of the original. The British seem to be able to make a really disturbing movie without any of the exaggerated histrionics of the American version. The original series combined spooky stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I have seen the series many times and I am still fascinated. <br /> <br /> It is another bad adaptation in line with the terrible adaptation of "Cracker". Get in touch with BBC America or BBC Canada and enjoy treats like Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then search for "Wire in the Blood" to get more of the truly discreet and elegant interpretation of Robson Green. Hollywood needs to take a look at this actor!
