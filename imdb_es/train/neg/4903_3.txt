I'm never a big fan of Taiwan's film production, unlike Korea, Hong Kong or even China. It is difficult to find a strong acting quality, as is clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself an audience as difficult to please as I am, in fact, a fan of independent films. However, this film shows weak plot and slow rhythm. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. Acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's performance is unsatisfactory, as she "acted in excess", trying to be cheerful and cute. Although I have to admit it's a pleasure to look at her. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, pitiful, extremely reserved character. In general it seems to me that this movie is a disappointment.
