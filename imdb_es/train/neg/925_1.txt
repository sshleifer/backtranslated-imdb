Ok, this movie f * ck in 'rules. It is undoubtedly one of the most inept cinema pieces from the technical point of view. Absolutely terrible, but you have to see it. rent this with your friends and create a game to drink or just have fun, it's hilarious. and the behind-the-scenes function proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and paint with your fingers. amazing. ok, rent it just for this scene: two characters are really WALKING IN THE PLACE for about 3 minutes in one shot. the director (in the commentary) says "yes, the follow-up was so smooth that it seems that they are ...". Yes, right man, they are totally walking in their place. it's so fun
