The overheated plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from a first juvenile novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best seller, although God knows why. For teens who want to get rid of a potential stepparent, it may have some appeal. Do not be fooled by the fact that David Niven plays the father of the playboy and Deborah Kerr, the stepmother in perspective. Unfortunately, too much rests on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberg. It is beautiful and easily meets the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can pose but can not act. Anyone who has seen her as Joan of Arc in the Joan Joan film by Otto Preminger, Seberg's first film, knows that at age 19 she was unable to wear a film. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was his second film; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? No way? The character of Seberg is at the center of the story and, despite how beautiful she is, and although she is 17 years old, she can not physically satisfy the emotional demands of paper. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she had no impact on my conscience in her later photos. But anyone who thinks that this movie is better than the mediocre one needs a taste test. Despite Niven and Kerr, this is still a youth story played in a youthful manner by a beautiful young woman who needed acting lessons.
