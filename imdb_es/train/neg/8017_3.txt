Actually I have not finished the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially in a negative way. But I do it, just because I stopped him because I could not see ... I reached the middle, and I only arrived promising that something good was just around the corner. This movie is so boring, so dull that they insulted me. I have not read many of the other comments, so I'm not sure if there are other gay teens who have suffered this, but I'm homosexual, and I went through "similar" revelations, day dreams, problems, etc. There were perhaps two moments when I really felt that this movie could go somewhere, where I felt it could have some meaning, or relativity, but these hopes vanished the moment the next series of cliché-filled narrations arose. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear the rhythmic reproduction, nor the echo-ey fade away if you just read the quotes, because they are too painful / ridiculous / stupid to let them pass. I gave the film three stars, and those three stars go to the director of photography of the film, who did a fantastic job of trying to transform the tired "concepts" of Archer into something that can be seen. Remember that it was not he who decided to include all the long shots of the close-ups of the television ... another unnecessary cliché already made in films like Korine's Gummo ... I think it's extremely appropriate that this film premieres at Sundance ( just because Archer had connections in the festival through the volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival in which cliché of nonsense like this is still accepted as "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just s ** t-house. Do not look.
