My son makes better videos than this one! I feel cheated out of the $ 4.00 spent to rent this thing! There is no date in the case of the video, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's worse, there is no production date for the original movie that appears on the movie's list! The only date given is 2002, which leads a tenant tenant to believe he is getting a recent movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad from the point of view that it is outdated and irrelevant for any period of time, but precisely when it was made. , I'm surprised that someone takes the time and expense to market it as a video. It may be of interest to students studying the counterculture of the sixties, the culture against war, against establishment, tuning, activation and desertion; but when you read the back of the video case, there is no hint that that is what you are getting. However, if you make the mistake of renting it, it will probably look better while you take drugs, so that your mind matches more with the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your mental state while watching it, I can tell you that nothing improves after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be sound asleep before the end.
