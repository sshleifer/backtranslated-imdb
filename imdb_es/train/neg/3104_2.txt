I've done a lot of criticism on IMDb and this movie is unique because I never saw the whole movie. It was so terribly stupid and without grace that I could not stand it, although I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this Mel Brooks movie that I call "Mel quotient". In other words, the better your film is, the less you see in the movie. Think about it: The Producers and Young Frankenstein were excellent movies and he was barely in them. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel and they are pretty stupid movies (yes, I did not LOVE the space balls, but this is not the place to talk about that). <br /> <br /> Second, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think of a less fun topic than homelessness. This is just a comedy circuit breaker. Think about it, people. The funniest scene (?) The movie makes Mel make a song with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster. And this is funny in what way?
