I have to say that this is a horrible movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie in the guide, it appears as a documentary. As I looked at him, I started to laugh, thinking to myself, does this guy really expect me to believe that this is real? So I had to look for it, and now it's a movie, but since it's not a documentary, now it's a movie with a bad performance. SO, in any case, it's pretty bad. Actually I did not get to the end. I had to turn it off. I am a New York police officer, and I felt that someone was trying to trick people into thinking that this is a documentary, with the intention of earning money from a terrible day for myself and my co-workers. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
