Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company has not bought this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while he shoots himself and stop producing. There's no way you can see this and enjoy. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea, not as a feature. I'm so sorry that I rented this movie. I will never see anything with the name Spurlock. It is completely garbage. Filmmakers like this should be on YouTube and never receive a distribution contract. The film states that American consumers and their purchases are to blame for the current depression when they buy and buy products, making money circulate in the system is the basis of a healthy economy.
