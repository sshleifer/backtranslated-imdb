Quite simply, this should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©. The chemistry of the screen that made the first "My Girl" so captivating is not here, and the acting as a whole is forced and forced. Writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines such as "listening to a barbarous custom" are simply shocking. Where "My Girl" provoked genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, as in many of the sequels, "My Girl 2" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably. Maybe I'm being harsh with this movie because of how cool the first one was, but honestly insults the quality of the original with the kind of nonsense that this delivery offers. Surely this has to approach "The son of the mask" as one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old saying sounds true; "If it is not broke, do not fix it".
