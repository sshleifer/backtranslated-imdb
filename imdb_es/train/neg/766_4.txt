When a story of Columbo deviates from the family plot (a colorful murderer commits a crime, Columbo smokes the murderer, Columbo becomes a plague in the process), the writers can somehow never match the quality and interest of the most traditional episodes. This episode deviates to the extreme, and the result is a great failure. <br /> <br /> Would you believe that: Columbo never confronts the villain until the end? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to deactivate it by approximately two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices that self-appointed reviewers do !!!
