If you ever saw the Dukes of Peril, you know that you never had to worry about drugs or bad words or the gross behavior of young children. If you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case! This movie was HORRIBLE! The main characters who use drugs and think it's fun and cool are not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and turned it into garbage. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original program, now looks and acts as if she were from the corner and is paid for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie, I was ready to go. I kept thinking I had to improve, but instead it got worse. I wish I had never seen this movie. It shattered a good show and left nothing but a horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something that is worth your money, because it is not only a waste of money but a loss of 2 hours of your life that you will never recover!
