Frankly, I am quite outraged because, based on the dazzling criticism attributed to Steven Smith, I lost almost two hours in his debut offer. Have all been written by your friends? The action is prolonged, the music is irritating and is used in excess, the script is simply serious and the actors (with the exception of the gardener), at best, mediocre. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but to say that it is brilliant when it is not, will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again, that is, continue writing his own scripts and use the same actors for another company . Yes, it's your first movie, under budget, etc. - I understand, but it is also available for the public to buy and not up to the task.
