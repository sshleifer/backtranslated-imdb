What the hell is this? It's one of the dumbest movies I've seen. I do not understand why the people in this place love him so much. It is meaningless and nudity without reason. It's the worst then Resident Evil. I do not recommend it unless you want to see chessy, shit acting wrong. Watch real Horor movies, such as Stephen King's It, The Shining, Jurassic Park (kinda horor), JAWS, etc. Leave this shit for rent when there's nothing else to rent. It's bad like Crudy vs. Gayson. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> Oh, wow, meat that eats zombies. How many damn zobie movies do we need? Skip this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
