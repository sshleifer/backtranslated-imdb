This attraction (which should not be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite domestic, I might add) looks good, but huh? Let me say it again 'huh?' Actually, the word 'huh?' It would be going through your mind a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try. I just do not know if it is complicatedly cryptic or just a tangled mess, but you can not deny how laconically uneventful, strange and verbose it feels. <br /> <br /> Related unrelated sequences (like that nasty opening involving a small girl, dead cat and fire) in a scanty story involving photographer Mario (played by John Caffari, who blows his chest, and Whose mustache is a dead ring for Nintendo's iconic Mario, what's the probability?) He leaves his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (a Patty Shepard who looks magnificently) who asks him to accompany him in a task of photography, where in this remote mountain retreat are some hooded witches. <br /> <br /> Look beyond the structure of the plot and roll over what is simply a grumpy piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing uneasiness. Raul Artigot directs some visually strange images and creepy passages, but for the most part he seems sporadically nonexistent and out of focus as is his writing. The amazing photograph of Ramon Sempere reflects the rich and elegant landscape as we contemplate the panoramic views and let time drift away. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was happening. Fernando García Morcillo's overwhelming and overexcited score is terribly combined with the compulsively dense atmosphere created. The drivers are capable, but there is also a robust group (the chosen one is Víctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slow with little interest, but this dream setting (which seems to go) and continues) manages to keep you watching until its closure.
