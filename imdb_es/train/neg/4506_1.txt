The American filmmakers decided to make a movie they think is Japanese. All the characters are badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely does not represent Kyoto in the first 20 and 30 years. Whoever has read the book understands that the writers did not add any additional value to differentiate the film from the script. Worse still, they even changed the original plot line with some errors. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who joined before in the hiding tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw a Chinese movie and although they represent Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again makes the movies more ridiculous. The last scene of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than the one in this movie.
