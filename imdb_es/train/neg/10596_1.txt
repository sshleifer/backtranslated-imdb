['Van Damme. What more can I say? Bill Goldberg. HERE WE GO. NOW we know that this movie is going to be really horrible. <br /><br /> I watched the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But I did not even think it would be THAT bad. The plot is horrible, Van Damme is aging (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are too. <br /><br /> Forget about this movie. Do not see it Always. I would not even get paid to see this movie. <br /><br /> 1/5 stars: in your heart you will find a wonderful trip full of action. <br /><br /> Well, maybe not, but the sellers would like us to think like that, right? <br /><br /> John Ulmer']
