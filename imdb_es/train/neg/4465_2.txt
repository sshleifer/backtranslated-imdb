After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is all in films like The Second Name, a production similar to a poorly written television, but acted and directed even worse. I did not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll Who's Ate Its Mother did not have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you are looking for a quiet night in a new movie theater. 2/10
