Fans of feature films have to endure a lot of terrible movies lately. Blood Surf joins without embarrassment to the list of stupid and redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously large animals that want to change the food chain. The crocodiles are particularly successful, since we already had to fight through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (led by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is as bad as these other movies and? over it ?? He likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater crocodile is supposedly 90 years old, measures more than 30 feet (!) And kills for fun! During the film, he entertains himself by devouring a group of totally stupid surfers and fools who came looking for new emotions while sailing in a congested area of ​​sharks. The only beautiful aspect of this movie is the tropical location. Although it is a completely unsuitable scenario for a movie like this, the lagoons and nature look wonderful. All other aspects are simply disastrous. There is a bit of gore but everything seems fake and laughable. The dialogues are frankly painful to listen to! You will not believe some of the lines that these actors have to say! I know that surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope for their own good they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy" but the crocodile looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateur and the massacres do not impress. I will not say much about acting since it's secondary in films like this. The girls look sexy with wet shirts and their tits bounce cheerfully while fleeing the beast. You guessed it: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad that it becomes fun again. But 'funny' for a reason completely different from what James Hickox intended.
