This comedy of service, for which Peter Marshall (the brother of Joanne Dru and then the perennial host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were exaggerated because "the new Lewis and Martin" is simply fearsome: some random gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works well, there is a scene in which Noonan is throwing grenades at angry officers and politicians; they are about five feet away, Noonan is throwing them in the middle, and the total reaction is that everyone shudders. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a frightening relieved only by the search for Julie Newmar, there are some Moments of brilliance: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional episodes of double talk and discussion, and their moment is almost perfect: clearly They were a well-tuned comedy couple. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to save this turkey, unfortunately.
