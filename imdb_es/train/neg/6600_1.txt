Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about that, you're a better person than me! This film, although it is a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, is far from honoring them, or even being a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is torn from the old L + H films and is planted unrealistically, the plot is confused with a useless characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars, the Pinchot accent was strange for Stan and, although Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he tried too. Difficult to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? The editing is choppy, the performance is rigid, the lines are horrible, physics is unlikely (although perhaps TRYING to give you that feeling of cheap sets?), And in general is something terrible to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last film in the terrible writing and photography of the 1950's. Do yourself a favor and watch as many films of Laurel and Hardy as you can, and learn how the things. You know what a MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not respond in perpetuity with semi-moronic jokes in each sentence. <br /> <br /> I regret that someone thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor for the guys. Where was the classic theme song? Why ruin 'Here's another good mess'? Why jump 'anyone the wisest'? Why was there a senseless herd of co-stars? WHY MRS. GULCH OF THE WIZARD OF OZ? WHY SHOULD LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO? AND THE LEARNING CHANNEL helped finance the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
