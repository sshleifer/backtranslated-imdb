This movie did not provide anything new or valuable. After seeing it, my wife and I agreed that the study simply produced it and that it might not matter if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a "concept only" movie: they have a concept about a movie and the other details are not important because executives KNOW that it will make $$ based only on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The movie starts when Cruella is released from prison and released on probation. She does not hate puppies anymore, but she has been programmed to adore them, she simply could not hurt a flea. This does not last long after her release and she has returned to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the film were the secondary characters. Eric Inactive like the voice of Waddlesworth, the bird made me hate him, and that is DIFFICULT considering that I am a fan of Python. It was obvious that he did this because he was given a lot of money (there can not be any other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny at the Black Adder shows, but here he is totally lost and without grace. And it must have cost a few dollars to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he was also completely wasted. There were also other supporting actors, but given the bad writing of the characters, I'm trying to block them from my mind. <br /> <br /> In general, it would be better to let your children watch TV than to bother to let them see this nonsense.
