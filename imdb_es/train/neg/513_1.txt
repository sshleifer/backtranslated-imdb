Burt Reynolds reached a point in his career where he seemed to be simply following the moves. He showed up, went out with his friends in the movie and took home a big check. He did not seem to mind that the product he was representing was pure garbage. <br /> <br /> No film personified it more than "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Run II" look observable. Except for a few career scenes, there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson ruins him as badly as a silly blonde is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Burt's thought is with Jim Nabors and he dresses like a chicken, it sounds funny, so this is your movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other film comedy and it will not be worse.
