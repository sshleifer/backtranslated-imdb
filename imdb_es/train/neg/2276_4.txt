CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, members of the class of the West Point Academy are torn apart from the outbreak of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> The OK historical drama of Gregory Hoblit makes an obvious point: virtuous men become blinded by the conflict, although the production seems a bit forced, despite the authentic details of the era and the cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), from Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defense of slavery and confronts him in direct conflict with his old friends from the north. The film's emphasis on such a misguided, though sympathetic, character is particularly brave, but the drama is flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is more efficient than inspired.
