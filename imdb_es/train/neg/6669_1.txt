I saw this movie in my film class. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I entered into it with an open mind, and I was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I never connected with this movie. The performance was excellent, the cinematography was interesting, but the plot, or rather, the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central theme, connection to the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? Something like that, but no. I like the twists in the movies, recently I saw "Brick" and I loved it, but the place this film went to was too much. It was so weird, and if they had not required me to go over the whole movie, I would have left. The writing was not terrible, but it was all over the place. By the time this movie was over, I was terribly confused and wishing it had ended sooner. There was something in this movie that does not resonate, I understand more unconventional movies like "Fight Club", but I just did not care about the characters.
