Maybe one of the worst teen movies I've seen. I will start with the negative points of the film, which covers practically the entire film. In the first place, something that nobody can avoid: ACT TERRIBLE. I swear they picked up some children randomly from the street because of their appearance. In the second place, WORK / DEVELOPMENT OF BAD / UNACCEPTABLE CHARACTER. You barely know half the children who are murdered here. All you think is that they deserved it one way or another. The character of the scarecrow was exaggerated, and a cheap scam from the other great fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: The Scarecrow was full of horrible phrases that would make you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some small animals to torture!" It really only leaves you with a raised eyebrow. Last, but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING How old was the guy Lester played? Like 30? The back of his head was bald for the love of God. There's a lot more I can say about this movie, like the cheap special effects, it's the effort of the "high school film class", but the point is understood. It's just a bad movie at its worst. As for what I found as "good" in the film: -Intention for people with low, low and low levels -It would help to put insomniacs in the dream. -A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
