This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida, seems to become a more recognized film area (such as Vancouver's rise to fame). The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a setback for the area (which made great progress with the film Indie Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new twist to the 'Boy Band' fashion. After all, both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, The Brothers falls short probably due to a weak script. Both main characters are flat and have almost no development (part of this could be the amateur actors, but in part this is the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they are fun the first time, but they get a little boring). Some of the "concert" scenes are misrepresented (and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately it is a disappointing effort. I also hope for the best for the next feature based on this short film. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres (quickly). Comedy is not your forte. But, it is indisputable that he is definitely one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it is a pity that at this moment he is infamous, not famous). <br /> <br />
