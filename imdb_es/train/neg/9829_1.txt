The premise absorbed me, but it was clear about 30 seconds that it was David Lynch or something really terrible. Interesting to see just to run through the fundamentalist washing list. I can be an imbecile for a soulful spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it at all. The message seems to be that we should all pretend that we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy, Jennifer what happened to you?) And follow the Bible blindly without any self-examination or we will fire the second coming. It's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets in 110-story buildings (work just around the corner from the old WTC site). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
