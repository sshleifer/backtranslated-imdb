It really is so bad of a movie. My friend rented it because he, well, is an idiot. But, again, I must also be an idiot because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with the high school drama geeks who think they're going to places. The only place they will go is to return to the waiting tables in Luby's. All I could think about while I was looking at this "gem" was how it was really done. I mean, some "screenwriter" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then, an imbecile with money believed so much in the script that he decided to disburse some money with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return with him. The actors were chosen, the places were explored, the make-up artists were hired, the computer animators just arrived from the School of Graphic Design of Al Collins were incorporated and this club began to take shape. <br /> <br /> Obviously there were a lot of things I hated about this movement, but what drove me most to madness was the excessive use of music. Every minute of this movie was punctuated. There was not a single break in music. And sometimes it mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you lose some vital point of the plot or anything. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to see Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit and then switching to a BMW 740il. You could not get two more opposite films in terms of quality.
