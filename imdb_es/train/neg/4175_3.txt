I think Micheal Ironsides' acting career must be over, if he has to star in this kind of low budget shit. Surely he could do more than waste his time in this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie could be much better, if you had a good budget, but it is shown repeatedly throughout the movie. There is a scene in an outpost, it seems, is outside the front of a train station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that gave this movie a 3, and it shows The spaceship lands and takes off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, which looks like an engineering plant, which I bet, and it does not look like a space outpost as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, it has a very low budget, it does not make sense and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
