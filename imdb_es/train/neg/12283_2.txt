University student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a demon living in a basement on Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hand, spitting a worm, a ghoul opening his chest and being roasted over an open fire. After his friends saw him levitating "6 feet" on his bed, a helpful and occult-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests they get into Alcatraz to face their fears. Of course they go to the middle of the night when there is no one to help when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The group is left stranded, Alex's brother, Richard (Tom Reilly), is possessed and begins to kill everyone. . Toni Basil of the fame of "Mickey" appears as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the group "Bodybag". She teaches Alex to levitate out of her body and makes a rock music dance interspersed with repeated nightmare images to avoid runtime. All victims appear as spooky ghosts in the style of Griffin Dunne at AN WESTEWOLF AMERICANO IN LONDON. The script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogues and failed comedy attempts. The good work of FX and the excellent opening credits (both of Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that gain any merit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 of 10
