This type of narration is unacceptable. The only reason why this movie is above the 5 stars of the 10 lines is because it has George Lucas behind it, and it has the words "Star" and "Wars" in its title. That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others who have made clearly superior films with superior history, writing and acting, but who did not receive credit. This is a parody. The first is the first. The history. The evolution of anakin? There are none. Apart from a little makeup around the eyes, and a little screaming, there is none. He becomes the young, stupid and cocky Anakin Skywalker for Darth Vader in one fell swoop. The only thing consistent with Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was in almost everything he did, planning, fighting, whatever. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his constant stupidity. He even loses his body due to an arrogant stupidity. <br /> <br /> What part of Emperor Palpatine that tells you the legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fight scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone flies everywhere like teddy bears in a fictional doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost all the fighters had a double digital jump around. <br /> <br /> In a specific fight scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climatic battle, both actually stop in the middle of the stops and the wrinkles, to turn their swords a few times as they move away. I realize that the fights are choreographed, but that made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was horrible. All the dialogue was of tremendous low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but that was not enough. I can not say enough about this movie. Too many special effects, it draws holes larger than the center of the universe, and absolutely no knowledge of any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is offered. We know that the general image of everything, all Lucas did was color it. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin lost his limbs. We knew that Luke and Leia are brothers, we knew that Luke is the son of Anakin, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda go into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this movie. If that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, Lucas could not have been wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and asks for Padme, and hears that she is dead, he approaches. his arms awkwardly and yells "Nooooooooooooooooooooooo" That scene screamed the whole movie B, and I almost expected Darth Vader to be "DANGER, ROBINSON, DANGER" at any time. That is what this is. A B movie, disguised by a big budget and a base of loyal fans who will settle for anything now that the first two movies have downgraded their standards to Earth holes.
