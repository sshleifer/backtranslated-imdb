I had to see this because it seemed like a terrifying big premise: the prisoners found a magic book, or err! Follow the claustrophobic terror, etc. <br /> <br /> but there did not seem to be a story to accompany the great idea. instead of chill / physiological horror, it was based on the effects on the open fire and the body of OTT, which did not scare at all if you are over 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous, with the characters being eliminated by nothing more than body counts. loss of good characters, which was the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously low budget, which does not spoil it, the movie really does not go anywhere, and I think I'm going to say this- You need a new version of Hollywood. you simply lose interest in this version. Definitely not in the same league as other French films that came out in recent years as crimson rivers that were at least visible / entertaining, malefique can not be seen until the end to be honest. and I bet you can guess the ending before you've seen the movie. Really really disappointing, impossible to recommend.
