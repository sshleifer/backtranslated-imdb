The director Jonathan Lynn has done some comedies underestimated in the past, like 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. More like a movie from the "Police Academy" than its inspiration, stars Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers as an army sergeant who always puts scams under the noses of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy squad seems unstable when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko on the spot. Actually, it does not happen much. Everything is pretty boring. It's not very funny Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman suppress a couple of laughs through a great effort, but they are all better than this and it is quite painful to see them work with such thin material.
