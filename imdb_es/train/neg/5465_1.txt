This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The movie starts badly (it would qualify the first minutes of the movie with 1/10) and then it will get worse, minute by minute. The only way to qualify it would be a kind of abysmal spiral negative number that grows for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes the humor in this video. In some way, the video manages to make cute and scantily clad females look grotesque and unpleasant. This movie is incredibly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked in with the TITANIC theme playing again and again and with Buscemi's character of ESCAPE FROM LA droning in your ear than to watch this movie. The sequels are not so bad. If you have to rent a Troma movie, buy Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would prefer to see 5 little Tony infomercials back to back than see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Do not get me wrong, it took some kind of genius to make such a terrible movie and if ever a movie deserved a prize for being horrible, that's it.
