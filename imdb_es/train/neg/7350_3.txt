Despite the bad reviews, I just had to give this movie a try. After all, she is the super-babe star HK Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental beauties as a team of action cat thieves. Are you sure it's worth checking out? Well, as baby parties go, martial angels are hard to beat. The sweet of the eyes is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and from the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my attention in particular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if one is judging this movie for any other possible merit, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action is of poor quality and the special effects are downright pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you are contemplating seeing it, it would be better if you saw Sex and Zen 2. again!
