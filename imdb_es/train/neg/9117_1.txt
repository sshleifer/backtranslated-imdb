... or maybe it's so bad. The plot is a cheap repetition of the first, which is strange, since it is supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. Almost the whole movie seems a new cheap version of the first, with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the first, but much more ridiculous and improbable. Where the first had a large cast, this consisted of actors from the B list and rejections. The acting is especially terribly bad. Half of the good lines of the film are taken directly from the first, as are almost all the main characters, including those who were not in the first film. I realize that this was invented by a pilot episode of the television series, but that's not an excuse. They did not have to convert the (bad) images into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and those are the erotic sequences. However, since these are not as good as those of the first, even this does not raise it above a rating of 1. If you have the opportunity to see it for free, and you are a straight man, it might be worth checking out, if You want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid it at all costs. 1/10
