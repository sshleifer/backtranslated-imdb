I confess that I have an uncomfortable feeling about ghost movies, and although I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to take life after death a little too seriously, and in my opinion it fails in almost every aspect that I can think of. The story is completely incredible, of course, and it did not convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental record. The choice of the leading actresses was appalling. While Paul Rudd is, at least, handsome and looks like a good guy, the taste for the ladies of his character seems to need a serious improvement, since Eva Longoria seems too old (sorry) for him, and Lake Bell seems too little attractive (sorry again). A romantic story without enough reason for romance is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they only had supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap jokes borrowed from unsuccessful television comedies. Nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
