They have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> It's fine. First, I doubted it, but after seeing the capricious cloud, I changed my mind and finally I convinced myself that they had sex with watermelons, with dead or alive people. There is no safe sex of course. the leader (terribly ugly) throws everything in the lady's mouth after she made the dead lady. Have you never heard of HIV? I suppose not. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mainly boring, but also incredibly disgusting. In fact, in some places it became so unpleasant that I could not take my virgin eyes off. Sex with dead people! How disgusting is that? And what is the message behind all this? We need water, we need melons, we need to be dead to have sex? I'm sorry, but this sucks!
