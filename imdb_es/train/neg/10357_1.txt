I really did not like this movie because it did not really convey the messages and ideas that L'Engle presented in his novel. We had read the novel in our English class and I loved it, I'm afraid I can not say the same about the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and he simply did not recognize the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason why I gave him such a bad rating. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of the L'Engle texts because you will be very disappointed. However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as it was my case), then it is a good movie!
