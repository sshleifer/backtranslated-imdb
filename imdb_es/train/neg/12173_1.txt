Me and my friend rent this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE THAT HAS BEEN DONE! <br /> <br /> Also me and my friend have 475 face shots. (What constitutes 95% of the movie). <br /> <br /> In other words: SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE THE WASTE MONEY! And I do! <br /> <br />
