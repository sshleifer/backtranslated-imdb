I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment that said this is the best Sidney Poitier movie. Poitier had just returned from a break of more than a decade in film acting and it is evident that it is screeching. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and do not include this. 5 of his films are on the AFI list of the 100 best inspirational films, once again, not including this. Berenger and Poitier, Rube and the player of the city set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border with Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film clearly fail and the union of Berenger and Poitier was cringeworthy and uncomfortable (not helped by a completely smooth script). Kirstie Alley (as the hostage) was underutilized, and almost totally ignored when she was on the screen. Some attempt at suspense is made, for example, when you are supposed to try to guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is the killer (they are all plaster type villains). I understand that this is all the attraction for most fans. I guessed who he was and I really was not trying. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, look at the Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane playing his stuff. It is much better. In general, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring, and it's too easy for me.
