The plot is rocky. The performance is somewhere south of a secondary high school play. The cinematography is not bad, but it seems that it was cut with a machete. I could not decide if this was an intentionally silly movie or if the people behind it really thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running in a modern 'lawless' city using 6-gun rapid-fire platforms. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' things. Imagine the Good Guys who stop at an old farm and park the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitch rail. Imagine a hotel employee watching an obviously western movie (hemisphere) with a Japanese soundtrack but with English subtitles. Everything is really strange, but it could improve if you look at it while participating in a small peyote. It is a true curiosity with modern parallels for every clich√© of Western films you can imagine. There is even a modern version of the good-hearted girl in the ballroom, and a Jewish harp that sounds on the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to their home for a movie session on Saturday night, tell them that their DVD player died.
