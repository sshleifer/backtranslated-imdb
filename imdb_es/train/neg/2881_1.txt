This movie was so ridiculous that I did not even finish seeing it. I thought someone had made their own version and copied it to the DVD of the movie store. This movie made me sick not because it was bloody, but because I wasted 2 50 on it! It seems that my brother and I went to a house and made the movie ourselves and edited the images of the slaughterhouse! I'm so upset that even the BTK killer deserves more credit than the fact that it was not even accurate. I mean, the fact that the cow's head was obviously made of plasticine or BUBBLE GUM OMG, I can not even pronounce all the words to explain it. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
