Kol, a prisoner of space in the corridor of space death, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the forests of America, where he, together with a new friend, tries to escape from the female cyborg killing machine 'Alienator. year after the best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this can not help but feel like a disappointment, as economical as the previous movie, but not as fun as I had it with her. the actors really stood out in me.The film is fine for the indiscriminate viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's all it serves. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
