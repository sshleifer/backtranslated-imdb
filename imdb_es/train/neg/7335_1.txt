This is possibly the worst version of the work I've seen, several times on stage, apart from the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for the set-up: the southern United States can offer a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction around the supposed misdemeanor of the hero. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very educated Beatrice who offers particularly poor performance. Waterston, a good actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The poorest performance is in the role of Don John: makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to turn it into a caricature of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the capers of Dogberry kops and his men, but the performance makes you tremble. <br /> <br /> Successful configurations include the scene in which Benedict is tricked into believing that Beatrice loves him, and if the acting were competent, it would be excellent. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict approaching are well produced. <br /> <br /> In general I had to force myself to keep watching, but of course it did not catch my attention. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> With regard to the last comments above, I am almost 40. I have been watching Shakespeare theatrical and film productions for more than 2 decades. I can suggest that when you try to defend your friends, you talk about the piece instead of attacking other critics when you are so inadequately armed in terms of facts. I can suppose, nevertheless, by your displeasure with respect to youth, that you are old enough so that the way of acting of days gone by is more to your liking. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite partner was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike the Widdoes, McTeer, an expert and charismatic interpreter, can act.
