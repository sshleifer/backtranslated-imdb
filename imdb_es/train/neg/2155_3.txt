Good evening, Mr. Tom begins in an incredibly exquisite town in the south of England, where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of ​​the period, we heard a radio announcement of the declaration of the Second World War. Soon, a train that blows clouds of steam brings the refugee children of London, and when the timid William is loaded with the reluctant and old Tom (whom you know will become a heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a sentimental trap it is. In fact, it's just the old formula of rare partner friends. Are not new stories being written? <br /> <br /> As I suggested, there is almost no period feeling in the village and not much else in London, apart from the strange old ambulance that rattles. And certainly there is no hint of Blitz's horror, as the citizens of London politely enter anti-aircraft shelters. Even when the husband of a local school teacher is declared missing allegedly dead, he later comes back to life. <br /> <br /> I found 'Good evening, Mr. Tom' cliché and obvious and the accent of John Thaw conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth making his accent of "country bumpkin" . <br /> <br /> By the way, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I did not like it and looked at other imdb critics who seemed in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
