Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. Without being familiar with the work of the director, I know the filmmaker who supposedly pays homage to Ozu Yasujiro. Although he does not even approach Ozu in greatness, Hou has not communicated anything of the depth of Ozu's emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. One of the things he misses completely is Ozu's attention to the character: not even Hou "presents" his main character (a perfect blank page). There are no medium or close shots of your people. One of the extras on the DVD offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what Hou does not do: a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish movie by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nada nunca pasa". That would be a much better title for this meaningless exercise. Throughout the film, they give us clues about a dark Taiwanese composer, part of whose work we heard on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. Unless you are a trainpotter, this movie has nothing to recommend.
