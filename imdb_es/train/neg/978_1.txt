I recently saw this movie with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I am a person they call a cultural barbarian. I hate art in any way. Rambo is more my type of film, action, bloodshed, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like the plague. Nobody dies, there is no action, there is no nudity, none of that. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. Start with 5 minutes of Nazi propaganda in black and white. All Italians in a block of flats attend a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an antifascist and a caretaker. The housewife, who is deceived by her husband, meets the antifascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the antifascist is gay. Despite this, they make love. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the man himself is deported by agents. The end. Do you want an even shorter curriculum? BORING ... So short? The boy should have used his gun at the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity. On a side note my sister loved this movie. Like I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
