I discovered that this is a total waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making films "direct to the video", but to repeat the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is a historical minimum ... they will soon recover. We launched the original films with new animations and new songs and called it "a new version of the movie that we all love". Nathan Lane, surprisingly, returns to his role as Timon once again. Timon and Pumbaa, the animated animals from the original "Lion King" world embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story as it REALLY happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah, blah, blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are sparse and the animation is crap . The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but again, when was the last time you remembered that Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane were in some real commercial substance? In general, if you liked the original, you will hate this. It is insulting because it is unfair to children and adults alike. And that sums it up.
