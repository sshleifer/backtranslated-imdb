This movie is so horrible that it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At first, the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are bored and without talent, maybe they were forced to play in this corny movie. <br /> <br /> The National Forest camera receptions are the only good thing in this whole movie. I should feel the same, because I paid for this terrible image. <br /> <br /> Let's hope no one makes a sequel or makes a similar movie with a story so worse :-)
