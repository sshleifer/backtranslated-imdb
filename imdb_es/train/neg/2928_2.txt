Actually, I really wanted to see this movie and I waited for months to get it through our Total Access account of Blockbuster. When it appeared in our mailbox, I launched it directly to the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which in turn made me angry. I will give an opportunity to any movie, even if I want to leave the cinema / press 'stop'. I watched him all the time, but I got nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> The performance was very, very good, but that was it. Nothing is explained; Although we understand that Mathieu gets depressed and lands in some kind of psychiatry, we are never given an idea of ​​his "fall". While we understand that he and Cedric are separated, again, we do not see what happens or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he had cheated on him once, but it was not a big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no, nothing. We also received indications that Cedric was the one who took Mat to the hospital, but AGAIN, we do not see him. <br /> <br /> I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly angered me. When Pierre, Cedric's ex, appears in the club and begins to have problems, we do not see his skin or hair until almost the end, and it took me a long time to discover that Pierre was the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds it is completely different. I could even be wrong to say this, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, misplaced and confusing rhythm. I can keep up with movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies that have flashbacks / flash-forward to the left and to the right, but CU did not capture and kept the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and you discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. He has an air of pretension in his "we're not going to tell you a damn thing, decipher the presentation by yourself". It's like reading a book with the chapters changed and the pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was too disappointing.
