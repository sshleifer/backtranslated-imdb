"I Love the 80's", which was not worth it in 2002, is a disorder of a series that was the first of a horrible television program that finally defined the end of VH1, which was at the same time the only channel oriented to the Real music that remains on television! I used to live practically in VH1 until spring or winter, I forget which one now, from 2002, when a garbage started to appear like this for no reason. By pure and morbid curiosity (I guess that's what you'd call it), I decided to go ahead and take a look, anyway, the first night it appeared, although the ads seemed like a complete rubbish. At least I can honestly say that I was not disappointed a bit because, to begin with, my expectations were obviously the lowest level in the basement. The emphasis of this program that I discovered in the first 5 minutes was less in each year of the 1980s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which is what I expected to see), but rather as an impromptu platform. so that a lot of really awful unnamed comedians are what they think is more than likely their comic skills * blank eyes * ... more like lack of them if you ask me! Now it's pretty easy to see why nobody had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all terribly funny and pathetic in their attempts for the so-called "humor" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot with each one of the rancid ones of a single line that shot one after the other! In general, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / is the garbage of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never see VH1.
