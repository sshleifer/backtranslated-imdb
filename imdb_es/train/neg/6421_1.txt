I am surprised with some of the criticisms of this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is horrible. The plot is extremely lazy. It is not scary either. People who think that because it's starring Sarah Michelle Geller is somehow like The Grudge should forget about that. This movie is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slower than her. I was very disappointed with this movie. It did not scare me or interested me either. Let's face it, this kind of plot has been whipped to death at this stage, for example. the dead who try to get in touch with the living: Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling, etc. It seems to me that the only people who currently write original horror films are the Japanese and the Koreans. The movies that are coming out of Hollywood, like this one, are cynical exercises to earn money without a shred of respect for the viewer. They're just being shaken
