As the cover says "The village of our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after seeing the version of Keneth Branagh and it was really a disappointing experience. <Br /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to various aspects of the work, including sexuality; a very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that by the time (60) it was a very well made version of Hamlet, but it can not be compared to the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> just a note ... I found the video in my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing exists. If anyone knows of any please tell me.
