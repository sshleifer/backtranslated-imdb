I think I found the most misogynistic movie of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film: Lilith was Adam's first wife and was considered imperfect and banished from the Garden of Eden because she considered herself to be Adam's. The same and refused to submit to him. Look, I took those words directly from the script. Then, the film continues and, although it is the heroine of the film, the only time it becomes acceptable is when it does what men tell it to do! Finish the film under the control of The Faith, a group of men! <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the script was predictable and the special effects were horrible. Apart from the obvious hatred towards women that is usually much more subtle in the modern movie, Darklight had nothing original.
