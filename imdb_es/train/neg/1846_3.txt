Well, I like to be honest with all the audiences I bought because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All the sex scenes were brief and done randomly, along with all the strange and cheesy background music, like all the other B movies: it does not look much like two people who have sex. There is a small plot towards the end: Kira's new lover is a murderer. Whoa !!! How shocking !!! Why do not we nominate this film for the Oscar Award? I can not imagine how bad the film would look if it had an R rating (mine is imported from the UK, it has a rating of 18). Conclusion? Lower it and move away, so you do not end up being an imbecile like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
