['It turns out that I bought one of those collections of 50 packages of &quot;Legacy of Horror&quot; and you would think that I&#39;m still looking for a good HORROR movie in them. Sometimes you find a fun but cheesy like The Devil&#39;s Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great films of Alfred Hitchcock (some are not horrible and they are only there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put films like The Island Monster and this because they can not accept the fact that they would be easily forgotten and should be like that. <br /><br /> So we open ourselves up to some sort of Westing&#39;s game idea. The rich but cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the only trait of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants whom he still hates. Carradine offers a good enough performance as always, but he leaves it mainly in a voice recording and in flashback sequences, which leaves us sitting through the mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast exaggerates or underestimates scenes. Since this was an independent film from the 70s, the lighting and effects are quite limited. It is difficult to generate a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what is happening so well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga make an effort at least and I&#39;m ashamed to admit that they let me laugh at the end, mainly because of the stupidity, but even with a bit of minor happiness, they managed a version of a turn to an otherwise It is quite obvious who did it, but not enough to improve the quality of the film. You are not supposed to like the characters, because they are selfish and cruel or psychotic, but they take it to a whole new level and make many people can not see each other. The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. Try that you will probably enjoy the package of 20 films &quot;Chilling&quot; that contains films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is better to avoid it.']
