Well, after seeing this, I can say that it is not the worst movie ever made. Yes, friends, it's worse than this. There are some positive points of the movie. You have the opportunity to see drunken teenagers, you have horrible deaths, and cute looking rats who eat a scientific experiment and become grotesquely huge, the drunken janitor, the cranky doctor, and yes, a girl in thong underwear who does not have No shame, stupid athletes, could not wait personally. the rat that ate these drunken fools, was encouraging the rat at the last moment, had a good premise, the first part of the movie, it was interesting although with the scientific exhibition about the rats, and the small background story, but I think it was ruined when the drunken and stupid teenagers came into play, the rat in my opinion, the one that gets lost, her name is Brenda, it was so fake, it must have been a cGi rat, it looked like a guy dressed in a suit beaver, this was pretty nasty, lame, but not totally horrible,
