Here are some examples that Pat Robertsons claimed without a doubt "a relatively good track record" in the predictions <br /> <br /> In his widely published comments on the January 2 issue of The 700 Club of the Christian Broadcasting Network, during which he predicted would be "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass murders" in the United States in the "second half" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted of having "a relatively good track record" in previous predictions. But a review of Robertson's 2006 new year predictions undermines that claim. He predicted, for example, that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will be strengthened." BAD <br /> <br /> * "The fall elections will not be conclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge." BAD <br /> <br /> * "The war in Iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion, we will begin to withdraw the troops before the end of this year." LACK OF BAD <br /> <br /> In addition, as reported in an Associated Press article on January 3, Robertson has a history of dubious predictions: <br /> <br /> The station predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election. Bush won 51% of the vote that fall, beating Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. INCORRECT <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would win after victory in his second term. He said that the Social Security reform proposals would be approved once again! <br /> <br /> He says he speaks directly to God ... If so, God has quite a sense of humor to see Pat make a fool of himself again and again ..
