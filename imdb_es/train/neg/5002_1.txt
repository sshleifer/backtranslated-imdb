How such a terrible script managed to attract this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and completely incredible, is well acted and is skillfully directed, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the worst thrillers of all time I've seen in years. Surprisingly bad, and not in a funny way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
