What an awful piece of garbage! Who are all these people who complain about how good this is? Yes, it is "artistic"; and yes, it's "foreign", but ... that's not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show but not so cleverly done. <br /> <br /> People are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, then I feel a lot, a lot of pity for them. <br /> <br /> The violence (and part of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and free. It's as if the producer had visions of being Quenton Tarantino. It's not that I think too much about him. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if I had neighbors like these, I would move!
