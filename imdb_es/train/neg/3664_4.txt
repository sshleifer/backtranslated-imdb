Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his unfaithful wife and his lover, and is then resurrected by a scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses it in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by strange subjects from the doctor's failed experiments. <br /> <br /> Upon hearing the death of Naschy from his colleague Jon Kitley, I looked in my collection for a suitable movie to watch. In my fight, I found that I do not have one, but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The movie has a questionable video quality, the sound doubles in a mediocre manner, the cinematography is a kind of slapstick style at times. And the American versions have two scenes of love eliminated. Frankly, without a remastered copy and no cuts, I was not really getting the right movie in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This movie claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf, Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you would not know it from the movie itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there really is no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the summaries of the plot in Wikipedia and compare them with what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Maybe the shortcomings of the film can be forgiven if we understand the hell of production that happened. While it was floating for years, it was only launched in 1973, due to problems related to the search for a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him. Those are not slight accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say in his own name. <br /> <br /> It is likely that, sooner or later, you will find a low-grade version of "Werewolf Fury". It appears in a variety of packages of three and sets of boxes, so you can buy it accidentally and not even know it. What really must happen is an American version without cuts, with a good combination of sound and video, and love scenes launched again. As far as I know, this does not exist. Let's honor the legacy of Paul Naschy and take his films to a wider audience with the level of quality he deserves.
