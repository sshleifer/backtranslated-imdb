Loving couple / sequel with songs, only this time she is the punkette and he is the straight arrow. Do film fans really like this movie? Do you have fans? I must say that the mind wobbles ... "Grease 2" is a truly boring business that does not even have the courage, moxy or nerve to carry the memory of its predecessor on fire (like "Jaws 2" or "Jaws 2" Exorcist II ") No, he whines in slow motion and often simply dies, looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost in the middle of a disorderly direction and unfocused handling, this was the first time a major audience Michelle Pfeiffer glimpsed and, although she is not ashamed, it is a role that is worth forgetting, a misfire on the lower levels, there are NO STARS of ****
