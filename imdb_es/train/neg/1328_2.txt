This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptually, it looks like Rush Hour, but completely lacks the action, laughter and chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a presenter and host of a talk show, but he simply can not act. It is horrible when it tries to act firmly; he barely manages to keep that mocking smile mark on his face while saying his lines in a line that, by the way, are not very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. Also, I have the feeling that Pat Morita, at least by current standards, does not give a very correct political impression of the Japanese. I do not even mean the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
