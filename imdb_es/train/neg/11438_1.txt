If there's ever been a comedy worse than "Gray Matters," I do not know it. The "funny" premise of the Jewish comedy in New York is that the brothers Sam and Gray are confused with a couple and, therefore, decide to arrange Sam with a girlfriend, only to discover that Gray is equally attracted to his goal Charlie The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently just a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply shameful 'drunken act' by Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would shame the forests everywhere for Tom Cavanagh's wood. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a total inability to do comedy and will want this to be removed from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the home friend with the lack of lumpen. Only Alan Cumming emerges with some credit, but he is seriously underemployed and has nothing to work with. All the disaster is cemented by the strange performance of Graham who rolls his eyes and culminates with the penultimate scene in which he wears a comedy hat and a coat even though the scene takes place in a lesbian bar. It's amazing that this movie has ever been released, it has no redemption feature and should be avoided at all costs.
