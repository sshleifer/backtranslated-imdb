I'm not just admiring the first Superman movie, a movie that Richard Donner masterfully executed. Nor am I alone in despising Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to Richard Donner's cut of the same movie, unfortunately it's still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> The world of Superman is one where the suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader. In a sense, there is no plot because the characters have no motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack of it) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this movie ... maybe the slapstick in Lester's version is more appropriate for the moronic script on which this film is based. Super-Duper bad.
