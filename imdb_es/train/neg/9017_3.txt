I captured this movie on Sci-Fi before heading to work. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being engulfed in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that does not interest you, well, I'm afraid you wish you were involved in flames, because this movie is pretty bad. The performance, to begin with, is horrible, horrible, horrible. All the characters are completely unpleasant, and the dialogue is worse than that of a typical Z-grade science fiction movie. Towards the end, the movie began to remind me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escape through the elevator shaft) , except with a Dragon, not a naked and invisible man. However, unlike other similar movies, this was not so bad ... it was just bad.
