We had the STARZ free weekend and I turned on the station to see what happened. It was this Howling II movie: The acting was terrible, but the sweet eye was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the sweet eyes mentioned above. I laughed a lot about the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never want to go to horror movies. If they saw this movie, they would know why. They used to laugh me so hard. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of trivial notes: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, had played Captain American in a television movie Marsha Brown was the inspiration for Mick Jaggers for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick It tastes great in women for sure.
