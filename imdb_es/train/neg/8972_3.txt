<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this film is, how to film a musical porter and use only 3 of its 15 songs? Merman and Lahr played the lead roles on Broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker red skeleton and the lucille ball. the changes in the plot abound and the fun is lost. <br /> <br /> PASS.
