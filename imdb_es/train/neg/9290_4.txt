STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The inmate of long duration Twitch (Kurupt) is transferred to a harder prison than the reopened Alcatraz. He says he is closer to his lady, but his true motives are a little more grandiose. There he meets Burke (Bill Goldberg), a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. The contraction, despite being less muscular, is equally appetizing and quite similar. But there is a gang war between Black and Hispanic inmates that explodes in a hostile takeover of the prison when the leader of the gang of blacks is gunned down and the fingers point to Burke. But the truth is that Sh! T hits the fanatic when the real murderer and leader of Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter as hostages. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not make sequels (apparently he is very opposed to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only accepts to do it with the condition of the cinematographic company he was in. He directed his own film. Therefore, despite being a DVD sequel, the main role this time is for Bill Golberg. (Steve does not even appear in some of the footage from the first movie that appears towards the end.) But there is a reason why he has not worked much since Universal Soldier 2 and is because he is not a great actor, and Neither is an action star, since it is a character that begins as very dark and melancholy, but that certainly becomes A hero of standard action who moves uncomfortably away from the foolish As for support, the veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have simply taken advantage of the possibility of extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tried to copy the style d the original quite well, with the dim lighting, the dark shadows and the rap music are reproduced in large part. He does it quite well, unfortunately he can not deal with an uncommitted hero, a villain equally cardboard and an apathetic story that the creators seem to have invented a lot as they went. **
