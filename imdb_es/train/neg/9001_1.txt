When I'm watching a movie, I realize it's 'just a movie', but nonetheless, I like to let myself be absorbed as much as possible in these circumstances. I think this is what makes us cry, scream, laugh or react emotionally as members of the audience, although, deep down, we know it's 'just a movie'. What I do not want is for the film to remind me that it's just a movie, so I can not slip into the aforementioned intrusion, regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this film chose to use multi-angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find that this distracts me terribly and irritates me. They could also place a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen that says: `Attention: this is just a movie. Do not let yourself be too interested or absorbed. ' If I want `picture-in-picture ', I will activate it from the remote control of my TV, but never during a movie that I want to enjoy.
