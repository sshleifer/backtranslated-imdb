This movie is a good example of how, through the manipulation of the media, you can sell a movie that is nothing more than a very funny little television comedy. In Puerto Rico, the largest circulation newspaper has written continuously about the wonders of this film, almost silencing everyone else. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the form and content of the film, and has pointed out all its flaws, clich√©s and bad writing. <br /> <br /> Just because a movie makes a portion of the audience Laugh with easy and obvious jokes, and because one can recognize the actors and the stage, it is not an acceptable movie.
