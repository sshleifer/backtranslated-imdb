I felt that mine was watching this ... but it seems that that is the reason for the madness that runs in the family in this movie. Anyway, it does not make much sense, as others have mentioned, this was one of the last films of Karloff and it is only his presence on the screen that gives him credibility. It's sad that all the great legends of horror films in the era of sound are ultimately reduced to starring in low-grade garbage like this. Marginally, Boris came out a little better than poor Bela Lugosi, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to keep all this mess. Strident background music does not help and distracts from any lucid moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast doubles in a strange, clipped, English tone reminiscent of the type used in porn movies of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> On one assumption, I think it is the "House of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe, from which this is taken, but it would be difficult to find a large amount of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> However, there are much better movies out there with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and give him a wide detour to this, unless you also want the curse of the 'shrinking brain'!
