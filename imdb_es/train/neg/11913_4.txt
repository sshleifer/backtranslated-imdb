A good idea, poorly implemented. While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good background story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite the good performance, this film fails due to the bad writing and writing of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another criticism made the point of needing to know where you are going to be able to arrive. This movie does not do it. It is organized in such a haphazard manner that you know that the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is a scene that is completely unnecessary and could be eliminated without anyone noticing. This scene even starts and ends with them driving a car, so you can cut from one scene from one car to the other and you have never missed the pointless scene in between. <br /> <br /> This movie also had the strange habit of explaining some details while explaining to others, some to the point where you can guess the complete "plot" in advance. He also had the habit of aborting an early fight, probably just because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes in which the "plot" is revealed in a computer and the final battle involves a "toxic adhesive" conveniently placed (seriously, what is that?). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's okay. She manages to get out of her "Roswell" character several times and become a good tough girl (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's done since he played Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this film a rating of 4/10.
