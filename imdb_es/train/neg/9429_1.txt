I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store, and I regret it a little. I will start by saying that I am a big fan of corny horror movies. They provide horribly tacky cheap entertainment. This movie was entertaining for the first half hour, because it was so bad that I could mock it in an MST3K style way quite easily. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> The acting is the most terrifying part of the movie. While you can not expect a great performance, this was ridiculously bad and, honestly, provided all the entertainment you were going to have. This is the positive side of the movie. Where the film really fails in entertainment is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie provides too many "What is the% $ @ # going on?" moments There are many moments, like the mother having strange attacks at dinner, and that has absolutely no consequence in the film. In the dinner line, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes in a row without dialogue each time a meal was served. During meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts out the pure darkness outside. Then go back in. And speaking of darkness on the outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the weather, where apparently it's not at night, unless it's raining. And speaking of the dark, a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit that you can not see what happens half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything else. In one of the climate scenes, you can not even say what you're supposed to be seeing, that's so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climatic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say "Wow, that surprised me, and that's good". I can say that the great revelation surprised me, because I did not see it coming. The reason why I did not see it coming is because it did not make any sense. I will not ruin it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding several parts of the movie to find something that would have validated that, and all we found was more things that said it was not possible. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is really better when you see it with the comments tracks that make fun of it. I love horror movies, but this was too much.
