argh This movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> maybe it's just my hatred towards the action genre, but even as a child when I was swallowing gut like Navy Seals, I still considered this movie with displeasure. now I despise it completely. <br /> <br /> take a pretty good story and fast-paced. Save the title and throw the rest. instead, use a story of future half-hearted gladiators, which is so full of holes in the plot, all in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the center of the arena, what about the cameras? Why have they clearly marked the images of what really happened?) In Bakersfeild in an unattended room?) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams eighty years, from the tremendous score to the bright and soft costumes . ugh. <br /> <br /> do not see this movie. I know some people liked it, but others resent the urination and I do not understand it either.
