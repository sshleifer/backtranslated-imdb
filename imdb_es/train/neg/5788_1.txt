Okay, then Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious matter with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a terrible mix of a Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What is this horrible mixture? I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three totally unrelated Japanese science fiction animation series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONAS de Dialogue (believing firmly that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and the artistic virtue of silence), edited the whole lot heavily by violent content, added some metaphysical jumbo, nicknamed using some of the worst voice actors on this side of the interpretation of hell (Reba West's singing was, and remains, unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to Ms. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity and plot issues. <br /> <br /> Of course, the mecha were great (especially those from the "Macross Saga"). ) and the parts of the plot that were unharmed were good. But what was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "announcers" he recruited. It was due to the efforts and efforts of the Japanese creators (uncredited, why would it be so bold as to accuse HG of plagiarism here?). Those of us who finally learned about the real deal and compared the originals with Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are much better, of course, and they make much more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, did something worthwhile: it prompted the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators. 'Intellectual property of such unauthorized and unnecessary works that produce people without talent like Carl Macek.
