This was a less than exciting short film that I saw among the Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film exploded due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself was not so moving and, at times, the plot was rather cheesy, as if it were made for classroom use and grabbed the attention of an audience wider. One consideration In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated, like when the characters talked to her, they used to say "Clara Barton" instead of "Se√±ora", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". In addition, a sickly Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a confederate a rebel, ...", almost as if he were the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. This was just a period of sloppy writing. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" on the TV show SUPERMAN) in a beard as President Garfield. Yes, it's him under that beard.
