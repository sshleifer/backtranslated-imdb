I saw it on TV the other night? or, rather, I went to another channel from time to time to see infomercials when I could no longer bear it. That was wrong. Really, very bad. It's not "so bad that it's good", just bad. How was it financed? Who thought it was a good idea? An actor, my friend, auditioned and was told he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what they wanted to say was "save yourself and run away from this pile of @ # $%". I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be fair, the acting was difficult to judge due to the dreadful American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was clumsy and forced. The dialogue was inane. By far, the saddest thing was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a ship in disrepair and, in the movie, it does not work well. Instead of trying, unsuccessfully, to make it look like a new crew liner with pieces of mesh around rusty polls, I'm not kidding, they could have changed the script to explain or even celebrate the disrepair. Mute, Mute, Mute. Do not look at this movie, not even as a joke.
