The poster that called this "Plotless and meaningless" literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I would add is "dispassionate". For a film made by a married couple in real life and with many graphic scenes of sex, this film manages to turn what should be a sensual situation into a beyond the ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during sex scenes, and the viewer could also take a Valium and have it done. Also, please, the women in the audience have seen WAY too many tampons used in their time, and anyone who goes on seeing Willem Dafoe taking a tampon of blood from his wife's vagina really needs therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the film (if any) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to Dafoe, who has perpetual sleep, what a "deconstructed jambalaya" is. (All the ingredients of the dish remain separate instead of simmering together). This movie is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: spooky house, isolated, dead spouse, creepy violins in the score, rare caretaker who comes and goes when he wants, deaths in car accidents and near deaths, characters with a secret past. Basically all the clich√©s of suspense that you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything simply sits there and never gets confused in a coherent plot or even in a piece of artistic humor. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes the "deconstructed jambalaya". The potential tenants of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the shelf of the video store.
