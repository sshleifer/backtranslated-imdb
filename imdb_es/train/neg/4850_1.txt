Some unrealistic movie spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From real-life experiences, this film continued to disappoint from the start. I am currently deployed on my second trip to Iraq as an infantryman. This movie has nothing to do with what would happen in real life. From the beginning to name a few: the car of the bomb, the elements of EOD that are thrown alone without escorts, the sergeant of EOD that slips out of VBC, the sleeves rolled all the time in ACU, to where I had to leave it in my Copy of 2 dollars haji, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is not necessary to list the things that went wrong with a time lapse of 2 minutes before other things were wrong; and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics to see that they have no understanding or experience with the deployments or the army. <br /> <br /> People with a military background or knowledge of The military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
