I did not think it could be done, but something happened and it replaced Open House, a low budget horror due to the fact that someone killed for the high price of real estate, like the worst movie I've seen in my short but sweet lifetime. <br /> <br /> It was touted as the best film at the most recent film festival in Montreal, which leads me to believe that all other entries should consist of blank shots along with people who read dark poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a small portion of hell. He is from Austria, and tries to find the steps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet: scenes of several characters who live in a suburban area with a dark area. There's the owner of the fat dog and his fat-bred wife getting naked for him, the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead son, the annoying flaunting woman who recites the ten best lists ... The list goes on Forever. Like the other two hours I spent in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in an intelligent, interesting, or even relevant way. I could not tell if they were good as actors, since, according to the subtitles, they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You're so lame!" Certainly they did not have to learn many, since each one repeated their same lines at least three times in a scene. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo, nor any of the films mentioned above. There's no art to discover, and there's nothing to stop after, except if you have to change your policy of "never leaving during a movie" (what some older couples did during a random orgy scene, and if that sounds like that) appetizing, it is not, unless he is one of the few who does not find the idea of ​​his parents having sex, and with some local middle-aged couples, to become a rebellion). <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me. Not the naked nudity, nor the soundtrack that induces it, nor the scenes without impact that involve weapons. It offended me that someone would spend money to do this when there are able writers and filmmakers looking for funding. It offended me that someone from out of town had gone to see Dog Days and wondered if that was the best thing that Montrealenses could find. Above all, I was offended that, somehow, the people involved in the festival deceived everyone into believing that the emperor had a magnificent and fascinating outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat wife who was making a Striptease <br /> <br />
