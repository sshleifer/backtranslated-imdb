I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series admits responsibility. The script is so funny that it must have been written by someone who failed the entrance exam for the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that's saying something!). Take out your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been crushed to degrade with this garbage. The rest of the cast lacks any kind of comedy or performance ability that surprises me that has lasted beyond the first episode: correction, beyond the auditions. All I can say to those who have fun is that they should be entertained very easily. And it is obvious that production costs must have been â‚¤ 100 per episode. And in case someone thinks I'm commenting like a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I should add that I'm actually English.
