This is not a comment about the film itself, but about the release of the RUSCICO DVD for North America. I do not know if there have been different versions and updates, but the discs we rented had a 2000 copyright, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mix on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. The levels often rise and fall; when the scene went into a panorama of the battlefield, the orchestral track sounded with thunder so loud that I did not know which would explode first: my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume used to fall into something barely audible. From time to time, the orchestra and Foley's work would be kept aloud while the dialogue overlapped at a much lower level. My wife and I discovered that the only way we could see this movie from these DVDs is if one of us kept a hand on the remote control to continuously modulate the volume. And, as another user has already commented, when we selected the audio in English, the dialogue continued to alternate between Russian and English; and, occasionally, when the characters spoke in French on the native track, the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you do not understand it. Ultimately, we gave up after the first record. Before disbursing more than $ 50 for this DVD movie for your own library, I recommend that you get a copy of the rental to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when it's loaded with such a bad sound, especially if you never read the book and I really want to understand the story.
