I still have not decided if this will replace Anaconda as "The worst movie I've seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the unreliable accents, the low production values ​​and the horrible camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing. for it. I only went to see him because he had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is that they did not. The characters appear with little or no explanation as to who they are and then proceed not to play a valuable role in the narrative. Even the main characters act for no reason so that when the movie reaches its climax you do not care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books from time to time must be rewritten to fit them. films and that it may be unfair to judge this film against the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of the trip home explaining what was supposed to have happened. <br /> <br /> They even changed the true meaning of the title of the books "Stale aluminum" by pressing it in another meaningless voice so that the film has a great title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of a movie from start to finish.
