This movie seemed interesting; I read the book several years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the scheme of the plot quite well. <br /> <br /> I started seeing it and almost from the beginning it did not meet expectations. In fact, I did not bother to see the whole thing ... completely silly: bad performances, bad acting and instantly nasty characters, that was the point of the movie, I guess. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie Leave a bad taste in my mouth and put me in a drink for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
