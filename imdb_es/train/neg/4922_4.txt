DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that was continuously shown on Sky Movies in Britain and, considering that it seemed to be screened three times a week for a whole year, I have no idea how I managed to get lost until it was aired for the first time in the net. TV tonight Actually, since I'm not a big fan of horror movies, the reason was probably due to my theory that this was going to be a gut. My theory was correct for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! SMALL SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of silly scripts involved. For example, at the beginning of the film, the bad guys are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (on a two-engine turbo prop plane!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the hold where Dracula comes to life. A fight breaks out, there is a lot of noise but the bad guys in the booth do not hear any sound until the script demands it. It also appears at the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems forgotten as the film progresses. The script is careless, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are numerous character scenes in the New Orleans mardi gras, after the characters are in a different place, like a police station in the next scene, then return in the mardi gras, the scene after that means that the lack of credibility in the plot has been improved <br /> <br /> There is something else that pulled my string: the placement of the product. There are innumerable scenes where the logo of a certain record label / chain of retailers is in sight. I will not dare publish the company's brand (except to say that they also run a train company that is a national joke in Britain) but I had the impression that this type of advertising was against the British guidelines and I am surprised that the BBC has shown this movie, if that is the case <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects in DRACULA 2000 like the images, for example. Actually, this is a good movie with a good looking cast, and those vampire girls were very good, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood in recent years: a very good looking movie that is very silly
