I admit that most of this movie was not inspired, but it was still entertaining. It has a wonderful sense of frenzied energy, music above average, and the women in the film are fiercely defending themselves, there are no prissies here. I can think of dozens of other movies that were much worse, at least this one had an intriguing plot along with some social commentary. They allude to how the military faces viral epidemics, destroys everything in sight, even if it means that people are supposed to be saving. In addition, how dangerous can martial law be since at that time democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to try to combine his previous work (zombie, beyond, gates of hell) in an effort to improve somehow in them. He failed, but definitely not miserably, as many people would make you think. I have a weak point for zombie movies, so I admit I'm a bit skewed when it comes to reviewing them. The only thing I say is that this movie is good for once, if there was not so much descent in the making of this film. (Fulci quit and bruno (I can hack with the best of them) mattei took over) could have been much better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song. A surprising note is that there is a scene in the zombie 3 that the man from the cemetery actually started, I could not believe it, check it out, you will be surprised.
