I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before completely giving up his job. Unfortunately, having dealt with Lucas at such an early age, Howard is now trapped in many of Lucas' traits. How else do you explain your disaster rampage? His only useful movie, of course, has been 'Willow'. Everything else, including this, depends too much on surface garbage. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> You can not even have a semi-intelligent approach like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard is so stuck in his Spielberg imitation qualities that they forget him quickly. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "love conquers everything, even disease". It's a pity for Howard that Lynch has already passed all the subtext with more skill. Hell, even Disney did better than this. Ron even makes mistakes with the possibilities presented by imagined realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's comment track is just horrible. Do not even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
