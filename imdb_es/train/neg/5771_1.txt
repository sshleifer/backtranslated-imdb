I will begin by apologizing to filmmakers around the world for using the terms "filmmaker", "movie" or "film" in relation to this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh. <br /> <The writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The direction: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The performance: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too inept for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to put together this atrocity: NONE NOTHING. <br /> <br /> This mass of rubbish could hardly be called cinema. Most family home movies are closer to winning that distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a capture of 10 cars captured in the video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the plot in this review, because there are too many holes to cover at the same time. Let's say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. Calling the one-dimensional performance would be to give them credit. What little there is is, to begin with, atrocious, and it gets much worse because of the terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, however, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects. ... or rather the disturbing lack of it. There are no blank spaces in the guns, no flashpots, and the few sound effects that existed were the "gun" sounds or those that were generated by the mouth (yes, you read correctly). The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt that it made them sound more futuristic. This is supposed to be established in the year 2031, after all. However, that does not explain the sounds he created by mouth for the scenes of the fist fight. <br /> <br /> If it was not bad enough for the quality of the sound to be terrible (just use the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and you see), the use of the sounds of the guns It was almost worse than not using any sound at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a flock of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. Imagine this: the bad guy enters an office building in search of his prey. A lady starts running with fear. He raises his weapon (an uzi), and shakes it. We hear a sound that clearly is not an uzi. The woman escapes from the camera, and suddenly a bag of blood (only 1) explodes on her back (it looks like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Hold on. Keep in mind that my description does too much justice to the ineptitude of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, one that almost, but not quite, makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place on a staircase. The bad boy pursues the good man and the lady who is protecting by the stairs, waving his plastic uzi all the way. You may want to bend over; There are badly programmed sound effects flying all over the place. <br /> <br /> I assumed that Alan DeHerrera can not be locked up for conceiving this train collision, but he followed it all the way to edit it and release it. . If there is some justice, it is likely that there is a bit of karma out there with your name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see this pile of industrial waste, and I highly recommend that you do so, be sure to watch for the full scenes being almost literally deleted from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that works like a walkie-talkie. talkie Try not to focus too much on the plot; It will only hurt you more if you do it. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And that's being generous.
