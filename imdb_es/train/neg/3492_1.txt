I do not buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for fight scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it moved too slowly for my liking. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fighting scenes, which lasted only a couple of minutes each. The last fight was a little longer, but at that moment I was so bored that I did not even pay attention to it.
