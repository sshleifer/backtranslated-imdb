"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call it ... it just does not reach the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I do not like Gangster's comedies (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked) It's probably more "witty wordplay" than the whole Comedy, only it's not so witty nor so sharp as (or the other critics) Do it to be. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start making a current gag sometimes painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There were not enough Location or Sense Changes for the period in which they were supposed to be. Most of the film was developed in the "Dreyfus Club" or in a variety of dark offices / rooms. .. (what happened to that Sit down Gun off off thing that Goldblum kept winning?) <br /> <br /> The support cast was ... in excellent paper (it was good to see Silva and Drago) but the characters were eliminated before They had time to develop. and the Richard Pryors cameo was a joke! The element Romance and love of the film also stuck. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll see him again soon.
