I read the books of the ordinary man of Kings like Bachman and the main character of John and his family. This movie could have been much more. The problem? It was set during the great madness of the action movie. I saw the movie and it hurt the whole thing. I did not feel anything for the character and less for his cause. Yes, I had fun (or laughable) scenes, although I think he did not keep the film in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire in John's heart as he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. It may not have been so low if I had not read the book.
