A terrible story (Amis at its worst), a useless and timid "decadence", obvious shock tactics and an irregular interpretation make this film (like "Rancid Aluminum") incorporate everything that went wrong with the renowned film renaissance British. The humor is, in the best of cases, weak, and the pretense of all the configuration (including some type of "terrorist group of Internet", ooh, how contemporary) begins to thin. <br /> <br /> Final summary - a half-hearted attempt to be "nervous" that does no favor to anyone. However, it is always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
