The first episode of this new show was today, and it was horrible. Shaggy not only had a new and shrill voice that made his lines torture, but it is so far from the original concept and animation style that it is barely recognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew, Scrappy, was there, the team was still solving mysteries. Instead, this new show features Shaggy and Scooby battling a super villain-type James Bond and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode that promised a transformer-type robot did not reassure me). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do THIS? <br /> <br /> The program earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo gang, all of whom speak with the correct voices except for Shaggy, and even then I am being too generous.
