* the review may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. It has a feeling of a television movie. The idea that the UN is taken by Satan is an interesting turn to the end of the world according to the Bible. The premise is interesting, but its performance falls short. If you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, at least make it quality! I was looking seriously at my watch as I looked at this piece of dreck. I can not say much more about this film, since I saw it more than a year ago, and there really is not much to say about this movie other than ... omit it!
