Where to start?! . . . I feel violated! That's right, violated! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours I could have spent doing something more useful, like watching the paint dry, in this so-called horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not action, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> It's predictable, it's boring, it's tragic ... < <br /> <br /> It may be a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, do not see it ... unless you also want to feel violated.
