I entered this movie hoping it was similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a badly written plot, badly acted on the film (with cells and CG animated peptides to boot). However, the real focus of the film is the talking "experts" who spew a new era of nonsense between the segments of the plot. <br /> <br /> Sure, the stars are pretty innocent. There is a bit of real quantum physics at the beginning. He asserts, for example, that electrons exist as a particle and as a wave, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the film takes a giant leap (and not a scientific one), saying that subatomic quantum effects also occur at large scales. The talking heads take it even further. According to them, the following is true: <br /> <br /> -When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see their ships because their minds were unable to perceive anything so different. - Meditation can reduce the homicide rate. -With positive thinking, you can walk on water. -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And that's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie felt like a movie that you would be shown to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that basically it's just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this could be seen as a campy comedy (even if it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: do not watch this movie.
