I grew up in Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love it. It's one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This program is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the melody of the song is tolerable and has a good animation. However, it is quite disappointing. Normally I do not care for Scrappy, but when it seems to be the main character, it becomes annoying quickly. Complete with the Puppy Power slogan, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. Also half of the gang is missing after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and lines of the story were, in general, lame and unoriginal, very little chasing the monsters or unmasking the bad guys. In general, it's not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get a clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, the voices, the melody of the theme and the fact that it is good for the children.
