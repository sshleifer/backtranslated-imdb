I was expecting a bad movie, and I have a bad movie. But I really could not imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. It's not about blood surfing, but about a big crocodile to $$. They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times, and it is the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the chance to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the opportunity to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you've understood how bad this movie is, do you have some good parts? Not really, she received some nudity and a sex scene that is straight out of a playboy movie. The performance is not bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she does not remove the lid. The main actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started well with some nice surf scenes. The fault lies with the writer and director without talent. The dialogue is one of the worst I've seen, and the script is very badly written, and the director has no talent, nor a great fantasy. <br /> <br /> Do not look at that. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. Not worth it. Watch the sirens to see Kate naked and look at Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks very nude, and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of shit they had to work with.
