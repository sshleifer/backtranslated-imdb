Naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of trash in film history is not an easy task, since the candidates are so plentiful, but Nemesis 2 has been my favorite from the moment I saw it. It was so much fun that we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard it literally was rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I watch "Scott of the Antarctic" by Monty Python.) <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an overwhelming feeling of "devils" firmly grasps the viewer. I am absolutely confused that this clumsy home video has reached the production stage. It's supposed to be a sequel, but it has no apparent connection to the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, although it took us half the movie to stop guessing, with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomadic attire! <br /> <br /> There really is not a plot, it's just a long chase scene, only it's so slow and meaningless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as good considering the quality of it, and then the film suddenly ends with an abrupt end after a brazen action scene with lots of gas explosions, without really explaining what it was about. Fortunately, it never gets boring, because there is something silly and false at all times! <br /> <br /> Generally, terrible movies are tedious, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect blend of sobriety and complete and unintended madness. that is really entertaining Rent this movie, or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
