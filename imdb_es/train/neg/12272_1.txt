In short, this is the worst movie since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one). <br /> <br /> What were you thinking? Some ideas must remain just that, an idea. The fact that this idea can be filmed should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about that, I hear you ask. A word ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Cost of rent: $ 4.50 Cost in time to see: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund of both!
