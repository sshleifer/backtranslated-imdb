THE RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer as a host of a TV show called Jerry, but it's not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, your guests are trash trailers, but not the trailer trash you get in JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack each other, but not as. in ..... What is the point of making a film about the program THE JERRY SPRINGER and pretending it is not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And on top of that this is a very boring movie.
