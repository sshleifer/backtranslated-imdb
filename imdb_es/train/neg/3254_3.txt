Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and, of course, this cute little girl burned the screen with her artistic skills and sexy and sexy body. China O'Brien gets angry as a police officer and decides to stop smoking and return home to his hometown and return to his roots and to his father, who is the local sheriff. His father is getting old and the city has changed, the mobsters have taken over the city and they have started to make local women start doing tricks and the people of the city were getting sick and tired of their city going to Hell. Well, you can almost guess what's going on, and you're right, China O'Brien defends herself after a great tragedy hits her life. Bad acting throughout the image, but Cynthia Rothrock takes this film to a wonderful conclusion.
