Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, it ruins all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, and then started making hideous car chase movies in Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the most popular property in Hollywood, just to invite him to make fun of himself with the dreadful Last Action Hero. And here, the talkative Eddie Murphy erases the memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure movie, which is incredibly tedious, childish and, in general, tremendously evil, in which the opportunity to see the big breasts of Charlotte Lewis in a tight blouse is The most attractive aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pure joy. This is the social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told him that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. Your job is to rescue a Tibetan child with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, the elegant actor Charles Dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was paid to sacrifice his talent. Of all Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I have read some reviews that suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a kind of film that is not a formula, and although both points are vaguely true, it is not necessary to forgive the fact that the film, for atypical and non-formulable. It could be - it's an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
