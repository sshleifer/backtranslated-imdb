That's the sound of Stan and Ollie turning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to list the fundamental flaws of this film, since they are so obvious that they do not say so. Little things, like "The new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" even though the stars died more than thirty years ago when they were made. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to have actors play buffoons that are called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as it is, it could have worked. For a really bad idea, try to choose two actors to pose as the duo. Okay, you could say they are nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be fun. Okay, forget about your crazy crazy "Cousin Larry" in Perfect Strangers, and look at True Romance. Here, however, it stinks. It's probably not all your fault, and, like the director and support cast, everyone who's better than the material, he was probably desperate for money. Some people say that it is difficult for Americans to master an effective English accent. Pinchot does not help here to this cause. What is stan Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in the trademark of Stan, the scream approaches, although as the cry is exaggerated to the point of tedium, there is nothing to emphasize. Gailard Sartain is a little better than Ollie, although it is like saying what is worse: stepping on the land of a dog or a kick in the handles. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the originals with your split-second time, your intuitive teamwork and your innate kindness? Well, that's totally absent, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes so you can park a bus through the gaps. While the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels, this one has some long-winded Mummy Hokum (and what a lousy title!) Which is mixed with the stage of the children's fraternity. I can not say that I have seen each and every one of the 108 films of Laurel and Hardy, but I think it is a safe bet that even their nadir was long before this. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were as if they were playing themselves, or at least using their own accents. At least it felt natural and not forced, unlike the artificial cartoons Pinchot and Sartain. And since when did Stan make the bad manners, and so many in that? "I was going to give you a standing cremation"; "I'd like to marinate my friend." For! <br /> <br /> The only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Harmon, of course, bought the copyright name (the disconcerting thing about seeing Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this farce. <br /> <br /> Questions abound. Would Stan and Ollie fake if they were alive today? Would they be glass mummies with broken bottles? Have they hit Stan on the genitals with a spear and end up in a great CGI final? Hopefully not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once, but I think that did not make me believe how terrible everything is. Why was this movie made in the first place? Who did they think the manufacturers would like? Possibly the worst movie I've seen, an absolute abhorrence that I got tired of seeing only after the first five minutes. As fun as having your head trapped in a vice while red-hot poker and nettles are forcibly inserted into your backward passage.
