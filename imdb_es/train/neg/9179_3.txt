It's cheese If all you want is a video game, complete with what looks like sequences cut directly from the computer for the action, the movie was too cheap to make special effects for that, that's all. My friend and I had a great time watching it, since the theater was almost empty and we could make some noise. This movie REALLY requires a heckling. <br /> <br /> Parcel? There was a plot? Okay, some stupid colleges or later people are invited to "the rave of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If only they had stayed in Seattle, they would have survived", direct quote, or almost.) Attend . They arrive there and everyone is gone, and the place is a bit shattered (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of an old crunchy captain and a woman from the Coast Guard (who acted just a little less hard, and a little less well than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight against many zombies (some of which spit acid), they hear strange legends , and they are mostly killed. That is all. <br /> <br /> It's not as BAD as Demonicus, but not much, and even better than Severed (they're a kind of personal alpha and omega for bad movies, the first is bad but fun for heckle, and the latter is too bad to see more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a video game movie as excellent as Resident Evil, run! run away now! <br /> <br /> Well, some very important questions (without too many spoilers): Since when did the Spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is there someone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling weapons and to whom, CANADA, for shouting out loud? Why is a rave in an anonymous (oh, excuse me, it's called "island of the dead", shya, on the right) on the island of San Juan? And outdoors, considering that this is THE PACIFIC NORTH OF THE CITY. And the rave has around 30 people present, "the rave of the year", my patoot. <br /> <br /> Luckily, there are a lot of axes. Many of them. They all have them. There must be an ax sale shop nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, although the movie started with a small "parody" (with nudges in I Know What You Did and Jaws), it was not achieved. near enough. <br /> <br /> Well, really finally, when the introductory comments (in a voiceover, not less) casually mention that one of the characters "gave up his boyfriend to focus on his fencing" can be sure that There will be some fences at the end of the movie. Not GOOD fences, but a couple of people who pirate with swords, anyway.
