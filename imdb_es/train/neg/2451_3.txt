This movie causes more involuntary laughter than anything else I've seen. Actually, if you're a Tolkien fan, rent it just to laugh at it with your friends. I will not be the millionth person to break their shortcomings ... all I'll say is that the movie (for me, anyway) lost important points for turning my favorite character, Sam, into a clumsy idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
