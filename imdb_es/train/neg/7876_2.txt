At a round table that I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers declared that one should see this not as a movie but as a thought provoker. Well, the only thoughts that caused me were the loss of time watching the movie. The tricks of the film (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as distractions from what was supposed to be a careful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views, usually a very boring film that preaches to the choir.
