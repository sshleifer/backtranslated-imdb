I can not believe that this movie has become a video, and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I asked for a literary refund. Eliminate the fact that the film has no historical truth and remains the worst movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a classified movie. B Do not waste your money or your time in this movie. Only a list for the voiceover and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved with this film should be removed from the union, it gives the industry a black mark, but after seeing most of this film, I really do not think anyone involved is a member of the union.
