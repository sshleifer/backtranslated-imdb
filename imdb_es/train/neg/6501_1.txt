This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think they understood. Anyone who tries to understand this is a MORON! My advice would be to take TWO not one, but TWO very strong acid beats and at least you will get a visual thrill of it. Although in the end you can kill yourself by wasting your acid. Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who will try to defend the film. Unintelligible Garbage Schitzoid. Waste of talent The film is ice, with paper in the destination with looming clouds, in a sunny dip in the pudding ... It sounds like a lion at a red light with the hair you see. Now explain that to me !!!!
