Basically it is a couple who wants to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt him. If you think this is stupid, wait, because it is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Save me!) The rest is practically the usual cliché, about family problems, the jealousy of the older "brother", and in the end all problems are solved and everyone is a "happy family". Bored and worn as it is, it is also shown in the most forceful and least sophisticated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director thought he was being creative when he put a mouse on the cliché. or I was just trying to complete the minutes, but it only improved the cliché from boring to abhorrent. <br /> <br /> So, why did I give it a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some fun concerts, where Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the film would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother". second. He had kept up on the funny gigs, like Stuart trying to outwit the cat, and he had left out the boring clichés that do not even match anything else.
