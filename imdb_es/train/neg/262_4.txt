Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that it sold out to get your first leading role in big budgets. Foxx follows in the footsteps of people like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have seen stereotype producers who think that black men who commit beautiful crimes are a waste of their talents (see: Money Talks, Blue Streak) ). <br /> <br /> Well, I laughed a couple of times and I gave all these comedians to continue playing funny roles, but I'd love to see these guys perform in the portrait of Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or, in Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans, from In Living Color, the moving performances in the Bamboozled satire of Spike Lee.
