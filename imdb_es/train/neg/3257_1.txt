After having seen the movie, the first question that came up in my mind was: is this supposed to be an irony or not? After reading some comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew that this movie should not be ironic. Then, the story tells us about a US and American Super-Doc that saves evil from a South American republic. It sounds like a typical story. But it comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory final fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I've seen. The movie could be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.
