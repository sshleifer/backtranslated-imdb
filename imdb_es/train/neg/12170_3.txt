It's no wonder that Pamela Springsteen quit acting to become a full-time photographer; It's a much better idea to have it behind a camera than in front of one. While this film is not exempt from interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is overcome by defects. On the one hand, Angela, the murderous assassin, seems to be almost the same age as the campers. Having a bigger and more threatening field director would have done a lot for the movie. And then you have the murder scenes. Apparently, the budget was too low to run most of them correctly (no pun intended), although the drowning of someone in a guest house bathroom is certainly original. But in general, there are a lot of movies out there that give more fear / more fun by spending an hour and a half of your life watching.
