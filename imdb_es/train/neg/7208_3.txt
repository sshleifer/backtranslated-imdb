I grew up seeing the old Inspector Gadget caricature when I was a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not solve any case and all the work is done by the talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action movie was decent, so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and felt that I should have paid to see this. <br /> <br /> Broderick is not at all close to the caliber of Don Adams' performance as the voice of a contraption. His voice was wrong. The girl playing Penny was nothing like Penny's caricature. She is brunette, where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does a decent job given what she had to work for. Dabney Coleman performs well as Cheif Quimby. Saldy, never hid in any strange place or had explosive messages that accidentally threw him through the device. <br /> <br /> The mobile device was wrong. He never spoke in the series and he did it well. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too smart in this movie. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a half decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was an imbecile. <br /> <br /> It also completely destroyed the slogan. Borderick says "Wowser." It is and must always be "Wowsers". It sounds lame with the 's'. I was upset when they showed the previews and they did not have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The ONLY decent jokes were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group to recover the henchmen / companions. Seated in the audience is Mr. T., Richard Keil, also known as the fame of the movie Jaws of Bond, a Herve Villacheze, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other one is at the end, where Penny is looking at the gadget clock and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams tells the dog that he says: "The brain is not in this moment, please leave your name when you hear the sound of the plot. Of course, this is not a loud laugh, just a nice nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. I should have expressed at least the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like this, anyone over 13 will not like it.
