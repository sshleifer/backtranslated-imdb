When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE premiered at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be as moving as some of Lassie's early films. No. <br /> <br /> The story was abysmal, the songs of the Sherman brothers were well below their usual level, the characters had no inspiration and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had seen much better days. <br /> I was also interested to see how ALICE FAYE's contribution would be, since she had been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so interested in her first roles on Fox. Alice too, was disappointed by the silly writing and unflattering photography. Another disappointment <br /> <br /> Here there is nothing original, nothing that is even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy, and clearly, no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this without missing anything.
