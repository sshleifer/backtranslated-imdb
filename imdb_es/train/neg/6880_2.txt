I was thrilled to hear that someone had made a documentary about what it was like to be Puerto Rican. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I asked myself ... could she possibly know what it is like to be Puerto Rican? As far as I knew ... she was a Nuyorican. Well anyway, I sat anxiously with my popcorn to see. I realized 10 minutes into it that my initial fear was correct. Rosie PÃ©rez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more a first-hand account, very personal about what it is to be a Nuyorican ... and all that implies. She (like most of the Nuyoricans I know) has a diluted, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not ... live here?) Yes, everyone is proud. As they should be! But many do not know the ins and outs of the REAL culture, history and political background or the language for the most part. Everything became very evident with his participation in the Vieques theme. Regardless of my personal opinion on this subject ... at least I know what the hell is the fight for. There she is being arrested for something she knew little about ... and she only participated because it was a "Puerto Rican cause". I really do not understand how she is not ashamed to acknowledge it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, see it as a partial account of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as a gospel ... a lot of that is not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian This film is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the basis for its information. Instead, it is only a step towards finding more information, learning and debating reality. Not just the one that comes from this woman's eyes.
