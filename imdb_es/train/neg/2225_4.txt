Honestly, I can not understand why this movie qualifies so well here, nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his best movie. I'm a big fan of Bakshi's previous work, particularly 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but frankly 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good movie he made. After that, he went to the mainstream, starting with the diabolical "Lord of the Rings" and then kneeling with the sword and sorcerer Frank Frazetta, for "Fire and Ice". <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is puerile, the animation is of television quality, I insist that it is considerably worse than in its 70 years, and while 'Wizards' had real imagination, rarity, a beautiful artistic background and an adult sensibility, 'Fire and Ice' It is designed only for children of 14 years and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked the Gor books, you might like this. However, from my point of view, this was just another weak point on the slide in quality after 'Wizards' of which Bakshi never recovered (although he has recently done some decent TV stuff) <br /> <br / > 4.5 out of 10
