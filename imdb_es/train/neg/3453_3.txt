It seems that more attention has been paid to the IMDb reviews of this film than to the source. <br /> <br /> Here is an unpretentious review: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing is going to happen, it is not like that. <br /> <br /> Wear it as you like, this is a boring movie, full of unattractive characters who do very little interest. <br /> <br /> One to put on Yes, if you want to convince an impressionable emo girl that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> However, it is not something that you should watch out for your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless << br /> <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
