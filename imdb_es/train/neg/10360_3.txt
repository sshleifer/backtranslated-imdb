I was very excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and enjoyed it very much. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for great disappointment, as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters did not seem to fit very well with the book. The address was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what was happening. He just seemed slapped and rushed through. In general, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you have not read the book, it could be fine by itself. At the very least, it could prompt him to read the book, which he will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
