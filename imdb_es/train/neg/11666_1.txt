As gently as I can, I sincerely believe that this movie is a waste of time. I did not find the movie "warm and emotionally satisfying" that others did. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the movie. The story was thin, the characters overdrawn and the direction pedestrian. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I am going to write something more about this movie, so I do the minimum 10 line. There really is no more to say and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so here it goes. <br /> <br /> The anxious child finds an incipient talent, looks for time with aging, a bitter mentor in spite of the parents. cartoon homophobia. Aging, bitter mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. the conflict arises. Although I do not think this is a spoiler, I have added the warning in case someone feels that so much information is too much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I just found the movie boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. Honestly, I do not understand the scandal that seems to be, especially in this website, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it's really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller used to say, "Maybe I'm wrong."
