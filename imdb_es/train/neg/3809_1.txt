This show is simply annoying! I'm sorry for the actors who try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laughing song tries to hide the sad jokes and the track "Awwww" appears in the most unnecessary moments. Too dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. In addition, this show is cliché city. If I had to look for the word cliché, it would read "Casa llena". Each story line has a "life lesson" that must be learned in the end. A good speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most abused children have a sudden realization of kindness. GASP Too bad this could not be possible in real life. I do not know how anyone could see this program without talking badly about the behavior of the characters or the hint of laughter. I find myself screaming on TV saying: "THAT'S NOT FUNNY / SAD / CUTE" If life were like that, the world would fall apart.
