For a series of fans, I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not all bad. But, review this series can not be based on whether it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I reckon these are people with ordinary jobs and a big heart enthusiast for Star Trek. But, doing all this work. Pulling all these resources. Taking all this time, and still with all those faults. <br /> <br /> First the acting, and the lines are horrible. For the majority. The dialogues belong to a military show of the 70s, not Star Trek. The captain (Mr. Squinty) seems to be about to burst into laughter at any moment. And most of the characters are just reading their lines. Directors should be aware of the fact that "take back" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think that the series is made in the manner of "Two Takes Frakes", who directed many of TNG's episodes and films. Also, I could not help thinking that most of the actors are typical of Trekkies. Without going deeper into that assumption. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern regarding the whole project is the quality of the releases. When they decided to spend so much time and resources on this series, why did not they make it available with a decent quality? The use of fast time format, with low low resolution, is a waste of talent. Even episodes of "higres" are considered to be of poor quality compared to the standard quality from which the series are launched. The use of the Xvid codec, with a larger resolution and a file size, would have improved the experience in a massive way. If the problem was the band with problems, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved it. <br /> <br /> We hope that the team decides to review the series, and maybe release it on DVD, giving the project quality. deser
