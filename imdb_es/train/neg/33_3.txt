This is the worst thing that the TMNT franchise has generated. I was a child when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that I remember when the monkey gangster explains his rhetorical questions to his followers. are. It is atrocious. Many fans hate the series for including a female turtle, but that did not bother me. So much that I did not even remember it until I read about the program recently. In general, it is unfortunately forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the musical theme. Pleased guilty, they call him ... Nananana ninja ...
