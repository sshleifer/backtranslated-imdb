I know you've read it before, in many other films, without a doubt, if you're reading the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the worst movie I could find. there is no doubt that the really bad are not even available to buy or watch on television, but even so I think it is fair to qualify that I am not just a foolish tenant who chose wrong. <br /> <br /> i 'I've seen two thirds of the 100 lowest films here at the imdb, and I'm marking the rest with all the possibilities. most of them are way above this ... exaggerated in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to rate really bad movies (like those that have no humor, even in how bad they are) for the amount of people You need to see to do it all. If you can see it for yourself, it's not so bad. If you can see it with only one friend ... it's bad, but it could be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took 5 of us to get to the Voodoo academy. and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad movies (detect the mic boom, for example, 3 times in this if I'm not mistaken) could take away the dry taste of my mouth. Yes, I had seen it, but I had also forced 4 of my friends to see it with me to achieve that goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we saw the directors cut off ... to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big ears with eyebrows glazed with baby oil, rubbing their torsos, it just scares me very much . Much of the film focuses on this. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decoteau for having managed to define this film in two days with a reduced budget, just as I applaud him for convincing people to pay him to do what is undoubtedly a version in celluloid of some of his fetishes. But it's not a good movie. The original store of horrors was shot in the same time period by a comparative amount of money (considering inflation) and was a real gem. It is not an excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead ... <br /> <br /> it's not even worth separating the holes from the plot or cliched to know all the hero characters ... The rhythm of the movie. .. is crazy ... nothing ... is interesting during the time that Decoteau devotes to the pectoral massage. It does not matter what your alignment or sex is ... rubbing just can not stand that kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> the performance is a cheese ... but not too amateur ... I have seen much worse in better films ... but somehow it is the semi-competent delivery of some of the worst lines that ever you've heard in a movie, what really resonates. <br /> <br /> Rent this if, like me, you have a fascination. with the worst of the worst, and only if you go to see it with a group of people who are prepared to work to overcome this. this is not ha ha ha the matter is wobbled affair. it's a resistance test that you probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there's something worse ... but I would not be surprised if it has the name of decoteau.
