If the only sex you've had is with a farm animal, then the label line for this movie probably remains misleading. <br /> <br /> This is, by far, one of the most boring movies I've ever had. pleasure to try and see lately. I found the DVD at my friend's house, and I made the sad mistake of not recording it. <br /> <br /> I can not tell any details without ruining the movie because there are only about 5 details in this. movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things in c-span, only that the fiction movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate in c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in this. Movie, but I could not say exactly what it was after I took my eyes out and threw them at Richard Gere.
