Many terror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I will not be very popular when saying that I found it quite boring. The idea behind this was interesting, but it seems to drag a lot. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes, horror films in the dark can work (like Humongous), but Scarecrows is in the dark throughout the movie. Most of the time it is difficult to realize what is really happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were difficult to see. If a little more lighting had been used, maybe it could have been better. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies that include killer scarecrows, other than Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that about Scarecrow any day.
