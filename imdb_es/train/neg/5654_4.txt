['I never heard of this film until it was performed as part of a retrospective of Robert Mitchum at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years on the cast list seemed tasty to say at least seven names, in addition to Mitchum, of high bills, in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not far from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and possibly even better known as the daughter of stage designer Theater Norman, Walter Brennan, who needed no introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic nurse in The Lost Weekend and Robert Preston, the best small-town man in It&#39;s A Wonderful Life, is still a decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter inventing the numbers. Unfortunately, most of them were wasting their time. I searched in vain for any &quot;signature&quot; scene since it was Robert Wise in the megaphone. By then, I had done about half a dozen movies and I still had to find a style. The story is our old friend, the war of rank, and Mitchum must have thought it was just a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy cakes in which he had cut his teeth. There are no new changes, if you do not tell the incredible scene in which Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to obtain information about his father&#39;s plans to move his cattle. This is perfectly true, but how did Mitchum know? We have not seen or heard anything that indicates how he discovered it. After all there is not much to say for this.']
