This movie has a very Broadway feel: the backdrop, the acting, the 'noise', and yet that's all it has. A little "sense" of a Broadway without the explosion. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow-paced, the image is disconnected, the song appears to suddenly remind you that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolerable: Sinatra's fianc√© --- surely, the tone and accent of his voice were unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's discrete singing (very skewed!) <br /> <br /> Surprise : how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in his scenes from Havana. It's the bone structure! How he would have killed for seeing Miss Leigh on a role challenging Brando again.
