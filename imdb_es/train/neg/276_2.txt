The characters are clich√©s and predictable, and all are pure or totally evil, like white snow. The acting is too forced to be bad in a fun and exaggerated way. It's doubly disappointing if you're a Bette Davis fan, because your character is not a typically funny Bette-Davis character; he simply frowns thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> In general, neither my wife nor I found the film interesting, touching or enjoyable at all.
