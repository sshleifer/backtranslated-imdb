Absence of a GOOD PLOT, absence of decent PERFORMANCE, absence of a good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of SPECIAL EFFECTS of decent appearance ... do I need to continue? Review MAY contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to be READING their lines, and not very well at that. Most of the "actors" acted as if they were in a SECOND DEGREE work. The story seems to have been written by one of the aforementioned second grade students ... it's not really that intricate ... it's so SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks that something must be missing and that he thinks it's complicated. No, it is not, it is EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think. I UNDERSTAND the "movie", that's how I KNOW IT SEEMS! MOST of the movie only had people sitting talking (reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was upset. The "special effects" were laughter. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in THIS movie ... it can be said that they were not paid, or that they were not paid much, because neither their hearts nor their hearts talents were in it. I LOVE Tony Todd ... however, he was only adequate in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason why I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony only participated for a total of TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest moving the DVD quickly to Tony Todd's two-minute segment. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this "movie", it would have been P.O.'D and I would have claimed my money. Hopefully the people who did this will do better next time.
