Unless you are an evangelical Christian, do like an Egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> It's horrible, why? Oh, why does IMDb list the most favorable reviews at the top of the list? of these that I just wasted the end of what started as good night in this trap. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot started strong enough: I was attracted to the film and became interested until the moment where the sermons of the Bible took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie has so outraged me that I registered for IMDb for the first time, just to complain, I hope at least to save someone else's night. <Br /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
