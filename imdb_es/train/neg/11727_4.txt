I would not call it horrible, but nothing shines in this movie, and it's taxed with a really incredible basic plot development. It starts well, but once the main hit is made, it becomes a long secondary plot around a girl that is not convincing, and some action scenes that are theatrical of the absurd and unrealistic. For example, there is a prolonged shooting at the airport where the lighting is strobe. There is no explanation for that. How believable is it that a storage area at the airport has lights that go on and off in a confusing way, and just enough for Snipes to make his incredible escape trap? This is one of the few action scenes marked by useless configurations that fail to draw a belief to suspend. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole premise seems to be that the CIA team of the United States can shoot the place but get away with saying "national security" to the British. This trick is based on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are many better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This is entertaining at times, but there simply is not enough meat in the bone and after a while it becomes boring, something that should never happen in a good action movie.
