We bought this movie in a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration since we previously bought the movie No Big Deal and we redid it. <br /> <br /> We were hoping that this movie would be very inspiring so we can redo it and put it in the tube. However, this was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. The bad effects and the script are not enough for you to see it. The main body of the woman seems to be taken at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, it only makes you wonder, did they blow up the budget and took their clothes off? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the shots do not even match each other and the camera work is so amateurish that it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. I CAN NOT believe that this is being sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> IT'S JUST BORING and UGLY to see. The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
