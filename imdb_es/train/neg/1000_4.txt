The plot for Descent, if in fact it can be called a plot, has two notable events. One near the beginning, one at the end. Together, these events represent approximately 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean everything) is basically the director's desperate effort to complete the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I do not care about gritty scenes, but if you expect me to sit for 60 minutes of nebulous / dark scenes (literally) without ANY story, you have something else to come. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she does not get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a couple of hours to throw and you want to see "Descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.
