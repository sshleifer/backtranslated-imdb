Hip. Erotic. Maliciously sexy ... whatever. It's "The Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The policeman saves the girl (the waitress!) From the big monster and refers to himself as his "protector". The main actor Ryan Alosio does a good job emulating Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre in a police district ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and even contains a dialogue like "You said yourself, he will never stop. The terrible script comes from a scriptwriter for the first time who, thank God, has not sold anything since this time, and everything is made up of the famous and bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a strip bar (it's always a good sign), and a bad-looking type of motorcyclist bursts in for no apparent reason, pursued by three policemen. One of them is black, and (horrified!) He is the one who dies in the first five minutes. The film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little bit with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal end. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the cast is presented as competent actors who do what they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to settle for less. If nothing else they seem to be learning how to act in this film, and Alosio, along with some of the supporting actors, shows signs of talent. Dark Wolf in his human form is played by the giant Kane Hodder, famous for his numerous portraits of Jason Vorhees in the films of "Friday the 13th". It's decent enough, especially considering he's not used to speaking roles. <br /> <br /> He has become famous among groups of teenagers who are horny for the lesbian scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who takes off the kit. A couple of times in the great tradition of the former actresses 'Power Rangers'. And it's disconcertingly clear that the editor spent too much time in that scene ... anyway, the main feature is that the physical effects of the werewolf are pretty good and that the design of the wolf is not bad at all. But the CGI is bad. Just bad I mean seriously, if you can not reach a certain level of realism, why bother? Just throw a little extra money into makeup! Apart from the terrible script, this movie has its moments, many of which are involuntarily funny. It's good to laugh if you do not have anything better to do, but just do not spend money on it. Please.
