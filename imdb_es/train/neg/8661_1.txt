the film seems as if the director was forced to make this film by a gang of terrorists. it should really be called dinosaur crap. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in this movie ... even the actors are not worth a penny. Do not waste your time watching this movie. The director must be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie. I mean, are not you ashamed to look at people's faces after they've seen your movie? the dinocroc seems that it was done in power point and practically in cut and paste things. and it's the same old story. man plays god creates some creature. He escapes and is happy eating people. and, finally, a pretty girl and a man in a sleeveless shirt have to come and kill him. bla bla .. U will discover the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
