Irwin Allen was great. All of his television shows had a great pilot, or first episode. The rest were basically a scam from their other shows. Some episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were a scam of their older TV shows. An episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the group needs an appendage operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost his contact with television programs after the 60s. The performance is strong with Martin Milner. The children's stars that arrived there begin with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. A bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption calling him the "Master of Disasters".
