['In general, I do not comment anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one, this one - I have to comment ... I was convinced to see this movie in worlds like action, F-117 and other high tech things. , but only for a few minutes and I changed my mind ... Acting badly, badly written and a great science fiction. <br /><br /> It&#39;s one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen ... <br /><br /> Just ... do not bother ... <br /><br /> And one more thing, before any movie, I usually check the comments of the users and the rating on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this film a chance, now I wonder WHO qualifies this movie with more of 2 points? ???????']
