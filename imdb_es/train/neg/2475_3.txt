I was disappointed. The film was a little predictable and did not live up to the exaggerations in the whole box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, the myth of Windego was used in a single premise and the house was pretty creepy, but I missed it. I kept waiting for that great AHHHHH or BOO! But I never arrive. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was riddled with poor filming of poor special effects. In this way, it shows much of the bad and does not use the atmosphere and imagination of the viewer to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if you're looking for a low-budget yet well-conceived horror movie.
