The movie is just bad. Just horrible The chain of bad Bollywood movies has no end! They must be running out of excuses to make such horrible movies (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have shown in the past that they have the ability to offer great performance ... but they were directed so badly. The poor script did not help either. <br /> <br /> This movie has many ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, he meets Om Puri (from whom he fled about 30 years ago and spoke again) and all Om Puri has to say is that there is To be careful. Of his friendship with Salman !!! What a load of garbage. Seriously. Not to mention the soundtrack of baaad. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is a total disaster to play a rock star. <br /> <br /> Only salvation is good performances in the second half. Ajay shines while his character shows his dark side. So does Salman as the drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look at it maybe only for the last half hour.
