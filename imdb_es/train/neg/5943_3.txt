This movie reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's seminal mafia opera was only wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable example of which took place in his fourth season, when Junior Soprano went to trial for his life. Instead of following this fascinating (and fundamental) plot, the writers chose to ignore it completely, focusing on Bobby Baccalieri's constant moans about the frozen pasta dish of his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br /> When something of genuine interest occurs in Notorious, for example, the first and mysterious assassination attempt of Tupac Shakur that caused the first dispute between the east coast and the west coast and ended in death. As much of Tupac as of Christopher Wallace, the film treats it like a plot more to advance. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that his own people had sold it? Did he just feed his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation from a primitive office drone into a sex-obsessed vampire really banal as it seems here? <br /> <br /> Neither of these questions is briefly addressed by the screenwriters of the film, who are much more interested in depicting Wallace's turbulent love life at zero convincing and dramatic. These sequences (which include an indescretion of grouping clich√©s in a hotel room) are so toothless and forcefully manipulated that the only real comparison that can be made is with a TV movie. <br /> <br /> The narration, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its theme and educate the uninitiated about the complexities of their life and work; The movie is almost totally useless. Confidence in the tracing of the meat and potato genre, along with lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should surely increase) is translated into a film that seems to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those. involved, leaving the questionable status of Wallace as a giant in his field as a preservation of the easily persuaded and only previously converted. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, in which the posthumous cultural identity of Wallace is painted in general terms as that of a saint of the last days, frankly made me feel like vomiting. <br /> <br /> At that point, as with any other, Notorious is coarse, calculating and committed.
