For a "horror" movie made for television, the movie started very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the end was a total disappointment. The film was advancing at an accelerated pace and was being built, anyway, it seemed to have a very climatic end. But guess what there is no end. The film has just finished and after almost an hour and a half, the audience is left wondering what happened. Why were all the unanswered questions in the movie unanswered? There was no explanation on any of the key points of the plot. This movie is like watching a murder mystery and then not discovering who did it. Very disappointed. This movie seems that the producers simply ran out of money and never finished the movie. A real bomb!
