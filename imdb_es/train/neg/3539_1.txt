The first two films by Ritchie were agile and elegant entertainment. Here, pave two recent classics? 'The usual suspects' and 'Fight Club'? and it still comes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite parading as a scammer (with the subgroup of 'Usual Suspects' "), the biggest scam he ever made was to convince you that it was you or" whatever it is ... ) and when attempting a turn of the 'Fight Club' on which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. For the last third, you know that you are being led down a dead end, and tediously slow. <br /> <br /> The cons, chess and game theory are all big issues, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitive to make much use of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the film (almost) visible is Ritchie's audacity with a scene and the dynamic camera of Maurice-Jones. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot and succumbed to a stricter edition, there's no reason why he could not make another nice gangster race. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of time. Incomprehensibility is not equal to depth. If you want to see a great movie that does not have a logical sense, but is a virtue of it (and, by the way, that also implies an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) see 'Lost Highway'.
