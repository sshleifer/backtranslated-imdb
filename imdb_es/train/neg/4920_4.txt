A very elegant modernization (keeping it sensibly modern) in the history of Dracula (although it is maintained with traditional customs) with a rather interesting story, if not fully understood, of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to see it I could only reach half, before losing interest. Again it starts well (especially the scenes with the thieves and then his encounters with Dracula), but for me it was less complicated when he arrives in New Orleans to focus on the daughter of Van Helsing. A great place to set it up, but never took advantage of its configuration (despite recording a paradise in the damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and they do throw that name), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, he had his moments with few dream images, but some kinetic editions and cheap shakes do not help. The messy script becomes considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains quite glassy, ​​inserting a lot of blood (makeup is properly achieved) and a lot of "Virgin" advertising. No, I do not mean the virgins, it's the music company, since it receives a lot of shots and the daughter of Helsing also works there. Oh, that was not obvious to plant. The soundtrack is a fun option of rock melodies. Now the performances are in the whole store, but there are some familiar faces to detect (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula simply did not come out, since not much presence was formed. It was simply surpassed by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's girlfriends. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are very good. Christopher Plummer takes a turn to grizzled while Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with their role.
