I saw the movie tonight in a free preview, and even though I did not pay a dime to see this movie, I still felt cheated. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you watch this movie, you will leave a Benjamin in your seat. The acting is clumsy at best; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst personification of Jack Bauer, and it seems that Michael Douglas realizes that he made a bad decision to leave Catherine Zeta-Jones during the time it took him to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; It seems that he is reading his lines from a teleprompter. And if you can not detect the "mole" in the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without television and without recycled stories. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In the line of fire. If you see and buy in this, you will begin to fear for the safety of the president because the Secret Service looks and acts like the major versions of 90210. No matter what you think about W, let's hope this is so "Art" does not imitate life.
