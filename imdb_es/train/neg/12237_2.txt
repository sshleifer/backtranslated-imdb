Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Frosty original caricature: it needs a little work, but it could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on July 4? Let's go! Give me a break!!! This was a movie that should not have been made. That was wrong. Actually, it was not for any particular party, except on July 4. That made it especially bad, since Frosty and Rudolph are often associated with the holiday season. And any movie can be ruined by singing too much. The frequent songs made this movie seem much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix two familiar characters of Chirstmastime with a traditional American holiday (which almost seems to "limit" it to the United States), too many useless songs and a lousy plot. The result? A bad movie that can not be seen at any time of the year. I suggest you give up this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
