Maybe I'm out of date or I just do not know how Electra is in current publications ... But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. Usually, he used others to do his dirty work and often it was a kind of double cross. Just when you think you have it all solved, put the wool over your eyes and get away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite weak in the dialogue, the performance was not particularly convincing and the action was irregular. I was really looking for something more like Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin". Which is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where cool and funny action was sometimes interesting, but most of the time the story and plot were slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not ... malicious enough. She is the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I just did not care.
