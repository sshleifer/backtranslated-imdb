Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that does full justice to any film merit. Unfortunately, that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It has a competent cast of second-rank players who absolve themselves as well as might be expected in these circumstances. It is run efficiently, completely in sound stages and standing sets in the backlot of the studio. It looks good, but it is excessively woven and, in just 80 minutes, it is still very padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the IG was surely an attack too. <br /> <br /> The issue that Julia has chosen to marry Pete instead of Tom is never anything. Tom falls in love with Lisa immediately and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia (nor she either). <br /> <br /> Julia's "feminine intuition" is presented as if it were to lead to an important plot. development, but it does not. Similarly, Pete's investigation of the cobra cults and the suspicion that falls briefly on Tom have no other purpose than to fill screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured as a mystery but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters are meticulously discovered what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly scarce. Julia is threatened purely by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her, she's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom shows up just in time to save her, it's not even clear if they threatened her at all. Then he simply gets rid of the cobra the way any of the previous victims would have done it. <br /> <br /> It's such an insignificant story, that I found myself wondering how he had thrown himself to Earth. the heads of study Then it occurred to me. Somebody said: "Those Val Lewton films were very successful at RKO, so why do not we do one like that?" <br /> <br /> Cult of the Cobra is clearly inspired by Cat People: mysterious, problematic, the woman who changes shape falls in love with the hero, is apparently frigid, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the friend of the hero and die at the end. But 'modeling on' does not mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin. Copy, but do not understand what you are copying. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he is trying Lewton's style, discreet and suggestive, but this approach does not apply to the story. Lisa is not Irene. It is supposed to be strange and mysterious, but there is no mystery about it. We glimpsed it after the first attack in Asia, so we immediately recognize it when it appears in New York. There is never any doubt about its purpose. There is also no ambiguity about whether or not it becomes a snake. <br /> <br /> Then, again, during your night walk, we do not have one, but two "bus" attempts. Nor does it follow, because the director does not understand what makes a 'bus' work and, in any case, they happen to the harasser, not to the person who is being harassed. <br /> <br /> These faint echoes of Cat People Dale the Cult of the Cobra the small distinction it may have, but only draw attention to the chasm between the original and the imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the most sincere form of adulation, but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattered when this small, warm time passer came out.
