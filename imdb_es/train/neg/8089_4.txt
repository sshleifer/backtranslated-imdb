I do not know what the acting style or vocal style of Donald Sutherland is about, but he always seems to be acting behind a wad of soggy Kleenex. He is just ... I do not know, THICK? Sleepwalker? In medicines? Strange. <br /> <br /> That said, I just watched the movie for the first time since its original release and, frankly, I do not remember finishing anything like that. A bad ending, too, because nothing is tied. What about the dead husband? The annoying child (and was the child bent?)? The Scotland Yard and the military persecutors? I would have liked something to wrap things up and give a dramatic closure to all this, not just the great panoramic view. <br /> <br /> And what woman sleeps with the man who knows she has just killed her husband? Even if he tried to dispel Needle's suspicions to protect his son, he could always have had a headache. That last encounter made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
