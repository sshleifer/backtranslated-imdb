1ยบ seen 12/6/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): musical disappointing from the point of view of the development of characters, in my opinion, of this much-publicized piece by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are a couple of good songs and a decent comedy performance, sometimes, from the King of Siam by Yul Brynner, but the film really does not do a good job of presenting the situation and setting. I can only blame the script and possibly some of those who act because we do not fully understand the situation of the character and their situations. I know it could be too much to ask for a musical for the enjoyment of songs and dancing, but even this part did not stand out much for me. The basic plot is about an English woman who comes to Siam to teach the children about top European things. Later we discover that the king is actually the greatest pupil. There's a forbidden side to the romance between the King's newest wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latina as an Arab, come on!) And an old mistress who causes some complications, but nothing really fascinating added. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie, is fine, but she is not that convincing either. The king learns some things because of his presence and then the movie fades away as he does so. This is really a tiny story with some songs and dances, but it is not such a good experience for a viewer.
