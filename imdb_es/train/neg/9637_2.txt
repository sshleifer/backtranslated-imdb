Boy, this was a terrible movie! While I have not seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This rich but ill woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean, which governs a service staff when she is suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who talks about common places. In fact, the whole movie is just a conversation festival, and a lot of the conversation does not make sense. Even in 1968, nobody could make face or tail of this pretentious fool, and the passage of time makes it even clearer. If it were not for the beautiful cinematography and the stage, it would deserve a negative rating. The only thing this film is good for is its involuntary laughter at the expense of the stars.
