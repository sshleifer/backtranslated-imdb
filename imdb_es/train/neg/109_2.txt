I think I'm going to make a movie next weekend. Oh, wait, I'm working ... I'm sure I can fit. It seems that who made this movie fit. I hope the creators of this shit have a day's work because this movie stunk. It looks like someone's home movie and I do not think they spent more than $ 100 doing it. Total crap !!! Who are we going to throw these things at?!?!?!
