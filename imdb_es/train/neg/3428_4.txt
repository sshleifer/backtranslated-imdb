Well, if it were not for Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis, Jr. (from here without billing), Rufus Jones for president would be one of the worst depictions of African-American stereotypes. seen from the early age of talkies and would not have been worth seeing for that. Mrs. Waters is excellent here singing "Am I blue?" and "Underneath Our Harlem Moon," while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in the entertainment world prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He is so good at playing the dance here that for a while I thought he was a small person with decades of experience. So, if he is willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for president should provide him with a good enjoyment. PS This is the fourth time that I've seen and heard the song today, "I'll be glad when you're dead, Rascal You", played in the film, this time by Davis. It must have been a very popular song about this time.
