I saw the Canadian videotape of this movie as "The Witching" that somehow went to the state of New York. The audio was pretty bad, I had to upload it to 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often overwhelmed the dialogue. Orson Welles was a murmur, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others were executed through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that keeps reappearing had its distorted voice. Some closed titles would have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or Satanists (the final credits say that the group was not meant to represent any real group!) They have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband moved to a city called "Lilith", where she was offered a job in a toy factory. Even though one of the AKA in this movie is apparently "The Toy Factory", we never see it, and it is only mentioned occasionally. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of his questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about his religious persuasion. Drive aggressively, and make another car go off the road and explode. After the police arrive, he takes a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused his miscarriage, although she does not realize it. They love her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware. <br /> <br /> Some images of the film have some impact, but in general the film is not very interesting. The film seems a little messy, and this is undoubtedly largely due to its reissue and the addition of new images. The original version, according to the final credits, was called Necromancy - A life for a life. The magic of the DVD could allow us to see both versions on a disc, but re-releasing this movie is probably not a priority.
