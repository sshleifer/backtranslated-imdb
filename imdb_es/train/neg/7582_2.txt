High heels are deceptive things. They can elevate women (or transvestite men) to new heights, present a clear statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a pain in the dangerous foot that will inevitably lead to stumbles, falls and final tragedy. Distant heels is more a disappointing trip than an elegant high-end one. <br /> <br /> The drama mother-daughter of Almodóvar is elegant, but in terms of the plot it is a tedious and tedious affair, full of complex and confusing. Characters that never get fully involved or make sense. Leaving aside some moments of comedy, Distant Heels is simply not interesting. The best comes at the beginning in a wonderfully macabre homicide case orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant black comedy things are improving, but then the film reaches its climax. <br /> <br /> There are sufficiently solid performances and there is an artistic direction with style that could be expected from Almodóvar, but otherwise, Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, spectacle, femininity, fractured relationship between mother and daughter and a character who is alternately judge, transvestite and police informant, this could have been a melodramatic power. On the other hand, he is poor. High heels stumble safely.
