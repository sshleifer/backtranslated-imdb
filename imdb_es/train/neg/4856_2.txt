For my life, I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally incredible film ... and I think I have the qualifications to say it ... I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the "lifestyle". .. This movie was totally unreal and, obviously, it was written by someone who investigated very little life in the Army, in combat or in teams or platoons. <br /> <br /> Three EOD boys chasing each other around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... There is no chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD clearing buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified Sniper Sergeant ???? Be real ... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me away without firing another shot or being hurt at all. Get Real ... I rob an Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with a 9,000, I break into another house of civilians, I mock for his wife and then I return to the camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night. As much as a scratch or a confrontation? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no adherence to the military protocol {Army} and it does not look at all like any Army unit I've encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who, contrary to this bad movie, are not wild adrenaline-seeking Yahoos, but extremely skilled professionals who do an incredibly difficult job.
