Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a serious problem with cocaine, and does not remember much. That would explain why he made this movie, but it does not explain why someone else in the cast or crew did it; I can not believe that EVERYONE had had a coca problem. This has to be one of the worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. The fault can not be placed at the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, since it is obvious that this image was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently he only joined spontaneously, since there is little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, plot, meaning, intelligence or anything else. What is really surprising is that there were some real professionals who participated in this plan. Co-star Robert Joy has done a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are veterans of the industry. Marks was also a director and it's not bad. Why they got involved in this pile of steam spoils is beyond understanding. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has done a lot of low-income horror and sci-fi movies and, having seen most of them, I can tell you that none of them is good. This, however, is by far the worst he has done, and that is a great achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is 12th place, at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is ridiculous, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is trivial, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time not even looking at the lid of the video box, let alone renting it. A complete, absolute, annoying, total failure.
