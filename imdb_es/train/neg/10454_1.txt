When talking about a movie called 'snakes on an airplane', we should point out early on that snakes are very important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here are very bad snakes that do not look or move. like real snakes. Snakes are scary because they seem to be slimy, crawl and slide. These snakes do not do anything like that. They slide like they would in a video game. They are cartoon snakes. I would dare to say that even someone who had a great phobia against real snakes would not be afraid of these <br /> <br /> why on earth would I want to include extreme approaches to these CGI failures? why not trust suspense ... the whole ethic of 'less is more'. Or better yet, why not make them look good in the first place? and then maybe I'll still use them in moderation. <br /> <br /> Take a look at John Carpenters 'the thing'. Here we have real silt, and gore of mysterious proportions. They spend 20 years and we get this pile of stinky sfx shit 'snakes on a plane'. When are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee? the special effects are receding! <br /> <br /> Sure you could say ... but the movie is a joke, you understand? I'm sure I'm with that idea, but do it right! Besides the above, this movie has a fucking dialogue. and the music and the sound effects are not spooky or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could handle any other actor that is part of this movie, except for Jackson. What was he doing there? The man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. Is this career progression? Are you offering people value for money? do not. I would like to know what Tarantino was thinking when he was halfway through this stinking movie. <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them what they want. When leaving the cinema I saw a series of announcements of some really horrendous future releases, like ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) animal CGI movie called 'flushing away', and another fucking comedy called 'click'. On top of that, I saw some horrible trailers, including one for (another) garbage / British comedy. I have not really seen the film industry in a mess like this for a long time <br /> <br /> I hope to see this movie for sale in the DVD deals section for Â£ 1 in 6 months. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of snakes that look great, and some great dialogue from samuel l jacksons lips. forget this.
