I saw like 8 or 9 Herzog films and none of them impacted me. <br /> <br /> I saw several documentaries about him. Obviously, he is an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but this makes him a good director. Definitely not! A complete anti-talent. You can make a good documentary because of the features mentioned above, but a movie with actors? Never! <br /> <br /> He can not direct or write. His scripts are full of ill-conceived situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and poorly made that they can not hide behind the word "art" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unskillful, so amateurish address. To say that he wants to lead like that and write shit like that is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene in which Scheitz is arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS THE ONE ESTABLISHING? <br /> <br /> He is a cheater; He knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get his attention and empty praise. It does not matter the rest of the script and the careless direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, then he could revisit his old films and try to find talent in them.
