Considering your pedigree, this should be a much more enjoyable movie than it is. Even with a collection of eccentrics in the cast, which fan would not eagerly anticipate a movie that brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The entire event is properly scheduled, badly done and often ingenious. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comical, as confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as he skillfully demonstrated in films ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he comes out better from this disaster than anyone else. Except maybe the cat.
