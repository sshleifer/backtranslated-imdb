A few weeks ago, I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. He fascinated me and I thought it was one of the best books I had read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation adapted. Unfortunately, the film was not even close to creating the atmosphere or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully made in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who watches the movie has read the book, because he does not try to show WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is delighted all the time, and almost does not act until the end. We never really discover what he does for a living, or why his love relationship is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not do justice in film form without the appropriate narration and explanation of the political system that oppresses the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest flaw in this film. In addition to that, John Hurt was a terrible choice for the casting, as he looked about 15 years older than Winston, 39, whom he was supposed to be portraying. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's a shame they got into a movie so horribly adapted with the wrong main actor. -Brian O.
