Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a B-grade mix of pop-psychic thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is obsessed with the demons of her past (most of her family has been murdered and she was, in at least one case, the main suspect), or simply has a really bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is his new roommate, and most of the action focuses on him. <br /> <br /> The character of Newbern is quite nice, and both he and Barrymore do a decent job (although not exactly good). The mediocre writing for (sometimes) totally horrible and the unimpressive direction seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. The character of Leslie Hope is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her. <br /> <br /> The plot eventually disintegrates into a forked (an arc of history is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) extravagant climax that is so poorly conceived, acted out and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of the value that the movie had previously obtained. <br /> <br /> In general, the film has the feeling of what could be the result of the first work of M. Knight Shamalyan. undergraduate film class. The performance and script of the two drivers are good enough for you to worry about them a bit, at least until the film derails completely and completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: send your doppelganger, but avoid a first personal meeting.
