Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with some top-notch credits under her belt. I'm certainly glad he's recovered from this movie that his fans seem to have. I am not one of them. <br /> <br /> I have seen better acting in high school plays than in Smithereens. The plot as it involves the young Susan Berman, who is ambitious in the world of music and is willing to do anything to get there. Even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who lives from his truck in the East River played by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn contributes to the worst performance of the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is good for capturing the familiar locations of East Village where the film was shot. But his work with his live artists was not up to par. I'm not sure I had so much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look quickly and you will see a young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street con man. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit through this for the soundtrack. I'm staying with Bing Crosby.
