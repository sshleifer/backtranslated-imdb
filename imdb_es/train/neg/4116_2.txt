My summary of a line should explain everything, but I will try. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie seemed like an exaggerated soap opera, and that's all I can comment on. . There were some interesting scenes, like the "Big One" that occurred during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake * pant *, wait a minute! That's Dante's peak! Well, parts of it were killed and slapped. I can not believe how bad this movie was made, "borrowing" scenes from other much better movies. One wonders what the director thought that the spectators are foolish enough to believe that there are large wooded mountain backgrounds in downtown Los Angeles, wing Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget the Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally). <br /> <br />
