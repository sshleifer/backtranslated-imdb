The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and their thoughts about her past. The flashbacks are about a weekend where young Ann is at her friend Lila's wedding. At the wedding she meets Harris, who will impact her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. His daughter Constance is older, more "responsible", mother of two children and has things together. Nina jumps from one boyfriend to another and from one job to another and is not sure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all the good things. The detail of the time in the movie is great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. They really place it in another time and place. And there is some quality acting in the film. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at portraying the main character and her fragile state of mind as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as a protagonist when she was young (and is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy gave life to the character of Buddy, Lila's brother. <br /> <br /> Now, for the bad, that unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly interrupt history as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between the young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. So ... you're supposed to believe that she really does not like you more than a friend and that her desire just bothers her. And I thought that the whole "he could be gay" thing was unexpected and had no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character acts wooden and chilling. If this had been another genre, you would know that Harris was the serial killer from the beginning. It's an incredible effort to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they do portray the others as foolish enough to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why do not Ann and Harris get together? They fall in love with each other. They have this big night of sex in the dirty old house of a gardener, they come home to discover the tragic end of Buddy and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet a few years later, everyone got confused and I could not help wondering why. WHY? The film does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people, so it cost me to feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The part of history in the present is quite boring. The cliche of a good daughter and the clich√© of a bad daughter. Nina changes throughout the movie, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene in which the daughters connect that coincides with old Ann dreaming that she is chasing a butterfly. It's really boring and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes", Ann advises us. The statement does not sound true with the story. And it does not sound true after watching the movie and wishing I had not wasted the talent of such good actors.
