My comments on this film have been removed twice, which I find quite offensive, since I am making an effort to judge this movie by other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Obviously, writing in the spirit of Nietzsches is not understood, so I will completely change my comment. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Subject: One You should be very careful when making a film about a philosopher that even today is not understood by the masses and among his colleagues takes passionate discussions. One thing philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. Therefore, making a film about your life, which obviously includes your "ideas" is something that one must be extremely careful about, or preferably do nothing about. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. One might think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who really lived and had / has a great influence on yesterday's world, today and morning. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen topic, the tomato. There is a responsibility for the producers when they make a film about real events. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Script: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accents. Why? It is distracted from what it should be; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It does not help to put things in a geographical perspective or at the right time! Come on, do it well in English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson understood it well ... letting his characters speak some Aramaic in the Passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is very exaggerated. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not an actor to represent Nietzsche. Bad launch. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It is a waste of celluloid.
