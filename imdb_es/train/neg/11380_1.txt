When I saw Robotboy for the first time, I found it cool and interesting, but then I realized that with each episode, this program tries to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. The episodes became predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyperintelligent child, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand his son, and his friends: girl and fat. In addition this show does not have logic. A super modern robot that works with two AA-size batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between the activated and superactivated modes. We see two different robots, and declines the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn to behave in human society."
