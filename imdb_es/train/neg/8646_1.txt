This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. I was going to get up and go to tape 4, but I took it off. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought that the main actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. Apart from the bad behavior of the camera and the excessive zeal of the camera, I thought that using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, everything on a screen near you" is shameful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. Telephoneing Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the terrorist planes that took place that day, was appalling. The movement of the camera did not make me feel bad, that cold-hearted trick did it.
