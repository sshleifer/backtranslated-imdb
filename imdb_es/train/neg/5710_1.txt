Well, it looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer are back together, this time in a mix of the movie Heist, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But, oh dear, this is for Indiana Jones what Speed ​​2 is for Speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights a childish script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advertisement for Freemasons. However, these Freemasons are not their usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think he has revealed No spoilers of the plot because there is none. There is practically no suspense, no surprises or climax, it simply stops. National Treasure points to Dan Brown but reaches the same intellectual level as a Scooby Doo episode without humor.
