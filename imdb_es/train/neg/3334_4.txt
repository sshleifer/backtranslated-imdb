This scared me a lot when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than scary, but with some rather disturbing moments and with a kind of bad quality that I like. And, now that I think about it, the plot is really quite unpleasant ... but it is handled with some kind of flavor. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are HAPAS ENORMAS in which nothing interesting or interesting happens. In addition, the ending continues forever, making a potentially tense climax look silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster", after it is exposed, unfortunately is not very scary either. The somewhat monotonous aspect of the film also works against it, making it appear like a television movie rather than something made for theaters. But it is an example of movies that are rarely done today, so I urge horror fans to see it and feel a bit nostalgic ...
