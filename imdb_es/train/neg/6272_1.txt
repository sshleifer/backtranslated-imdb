That's a fragment of choice dialogue delivered by the wicked, dancing assistant of a famous scientist to her maid, just before luring three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion to conduct behavioral modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to listen to 80s rock songs. A biker punk has sex with a bitch cyclist at a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the virgin daughter of scientist Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another cyclist (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! Back in the house, the bimbos of the sisterhood of women swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies to the mouths of the victims and turns them into slobbery murderous bibs! <br /> <br /> If that is not enough to entertain you, there is a hilarious theme ("Nightmare Fantasy"), skating on wheels, some serious goblins and a psychic puppet (!?) that warns "DANGER! DANGER! ! "Like the LOST IN SPACE robot, hitchhiking is recommended as one of the best ways to pick up men! <br /> <br /> This disaster filmed in Florida is so appallingly terrible that multiple visits are recommended to soak it. and it's not that NYPD detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN news anchor Andrea Thompson into one of the most frequent women of naked bimbos. It is safe! Supposedly, this started in 1982 and then new images were added for the release of the video in 1985. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (and I say it in a good way!)
