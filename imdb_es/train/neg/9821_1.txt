It is not often that I see a movie as terrible as this one. I kept looking, every minute hoping that this was a joke only to discover that I was meant to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre demands. <br /> <br /> The acting was shameful and the situations horribly devised and clich√©d. If a film were made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we would think that the cinema at that time was naive. As it happens, this movie was made in 2000 and I still have not seen a silent movie that has as little charm as it is. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not for the real fans of the movie. <Br /> <br /> [Not worth a rating]
