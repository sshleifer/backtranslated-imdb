I went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. This is what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not homosexual. FOREVER. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and was reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter. So it's safe for Americans to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. She looked beautiful in all her short cameo scenes that, although numerous, were probably all filmed the same day, one after the other, with the director saying: "Very well, now they look beautiful ... well ... well , now Look scared ... well ... now look depressed ... well ... now look interested ... well ... now look beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> more Greek men and Trojans had British accents. Those with an American accent could not act. <br /> <br /> The Trojans looked like the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink Camera. <br /> <br /> The biggest line of Helen of Troy was: "They come for me". <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go up all the way. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young friend with whom he was very close, but that's fine. They were cousins. It does not matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a complete story with just one expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, just like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the film had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were many blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would have resisted. <br /> <br /> Despite its location in the coastal desert, the Greeks had the strange ability to find unlimited amounts of wood to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like. <British actors seem ridiculous with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes his expression only when the sun shines directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their costumes always seemed impeccable. <br /> <br /> The Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were new.
