There is this girl and runs through the woods, but ends up in this woman's clinic and wants an abortion. His dad is out in a van and he is angry about that. The entire episode takes place inside and outside of this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted the option to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the baby leave and went to the corner. The part where they were doing the ultra sound was also quite funny. I was really feeling sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I really could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I was laughing too loud and I would suggest seeing "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode but it was not so good.
