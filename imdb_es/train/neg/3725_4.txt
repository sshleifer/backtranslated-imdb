This is an interesting treatment of a topic that is quite controversial (just read the other comments about this movie). Apparently, either you love or hate it, and it seems that most people make that distinction based on whether they believe that the tribulation and the end times will be reflected in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie, and its sequels - were made for around $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are right down there with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the performance is almost at the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Leaving aside the religious message, the story is as terrifying as they come. Add even the slightest thought that the story could really be close to something that could happen in the future and it will become even more terrifying. <br /> <br /> This movie, and its aftermath, did not try to include it. reasons why the tribulation happened when it happened. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get into everything "Thief" did and explain all the politics and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to it. The net effect was that "Thief" did a much better job in the terrifying part of the movie, rather than going too far to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget politics and watch this movie, and its aftermath, for what they are: horror stories. That they can be stories of horror told, indirectly, by God makes them even more terrifying. If it makes you think about the subject, you have done your job, even if you never believe.
