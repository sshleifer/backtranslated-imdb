I got a copy of this movie thinking it was the 1964 film with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie has a better rating on this site than the title mentioned above; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This movie is pretty bad too; obviously you can not enter a movie that calls itself 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and to be fair, it's up to the title with the amount of blood shown ... but everything feels very old and tired, which is not helped by the atrocious acting and the stupid plot. It's just that their average nuclear spill causes people to become zombies, etc. The film begins with a sequence that makes people melt and that lets you know what it is. Low quality zombie garbage. There's a lot of blood in the movie, and it's a really good job, otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath also seems very cheap, and was clearly created by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's Day of the Dead, although in reality it could be anything that presented zombies and gore. It all comes down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and, in general, I can not say it impressed me.
