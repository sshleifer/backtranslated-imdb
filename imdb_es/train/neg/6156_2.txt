This is a bad movie, bad. I am a real fencer: trust me when I say that the pretension of accuracy of this film is just that. This is especially true during that vile little scene in which shooters combine footwork with 80s pop. The ending is predictable, and the movie is a bore from start to finish. Horrible.
