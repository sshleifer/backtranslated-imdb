I have to say that although this movie was a formula with an argument stolen from movies like Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horror movies that Hollywood has recently released. The murders, although sometimes a little too imaginative, were in most cases just that, original. The cast was mediocre, which is expected from low-budget features, but much better than what the much larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio has offered. My only real complaint that was not due to the budget of the film, which must have been small, was the "twisted" end devised. I'm sorry, but this is what put this movie in the bad category for me. The ending was simply stupid and continued. Before that I was a little bored, but I was really enjoying it. 4/10
