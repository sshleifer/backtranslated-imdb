<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some of the impossibilities, this was actually a pretty decent horror / monster movie. Then, I will give some of the good points first: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially when he went through the tunnels to find lunch (hint: she likes humans). - The action was quite uninterrupted and, after a weak start, I became quite absorbed in the story. - I'm sorry to say that she was like encouraging the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, for the unlikely things ** maybe some spoilers **: - if you were hunting a dragon that spits fire in 1100 AD, would it charge in your cave with a gunpowder under your arm? ? Duh - A female character with a totally American name, blond hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend she's Spanish? Eh - A leading scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut with a knife, and supposedly was born in Chicago, educated in the USA. UU.? A military helicopter pilot who makes his own repairs, flies a huge transport helicopter without another crew and is an expert marksman and combat soldier? IN AGREEMENT. UH Huh. I will not mention that he gave 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> Still better than some of the Japanese monster movies of the '60s, but not by much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although, of course, the end left that possibility completely open. Or, maybe, they'll hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, I gave this film a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if you rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets Eaten in the first ten minutes. <grin>
