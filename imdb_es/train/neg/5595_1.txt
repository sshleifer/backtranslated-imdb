Wow, it's okay. Then, after reading the little fight here, I decided that I had to watch this movie by myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped looking at him. I highly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more scared / entertained. <br /> <br /> It is low budget with bad performance. <br /> <br /> Whoever is giving this 10s movie is completely wrong and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am not connected in any way with any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad MOVIE.
