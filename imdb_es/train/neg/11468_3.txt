I do not know who had the idea that orcas are out there killing people and hitting and destroying things for revenge, but my God is absurd. Killer whales are definitely not the cold blooded killer that this movie makes them ... it's nonsense. Killer whales are extremely intelligent, do not get me wrong, but I doubt very much that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I have to say that all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how absurd it was. So at least I had a little fun. Personally, I would recommend going and seeing Jaws if you want to watch an Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you're like me and you want to laugh at something so far from realism, I'd say go ahead. :RE
