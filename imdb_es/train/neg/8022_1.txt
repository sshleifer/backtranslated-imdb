I see that someone already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there but there was no plot. In addition to the sexual scenes that limited child pornography (which I think could have been edited or presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically), I would compare this movie to a recipe that was split in half. ingredients, without instructions on how to combine them into a finished product.From the beginning, the development of the character and the development of the story are lacking ... unfortunately, many times in this monotonous nonsense they bother us with bits of plot and think "Ahh, it's well ... finally, let's find out more about WHY this scene is happening ... or ... WHO this character is ... or maybe we're finally going to meet and appreciate this character is more ... or understand and gets more involved with this inter-character relationship ... etc. "But there is not so much luck! On the contrary, I was often tempted to turn it off more than once, but I stayed outside when the horia was hanging, only to find that any mini plot within w Whatever the mini-plot (and which is badly presented) was just a ruse. Why I stayed with him until the end is a mystery, apart from that, generally, IFC has better selections and they gave him 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters are not nice in SOME degrees, or that you can not identify with them or with their humanity at all ... it's just that this could have been much better with a little more effort. I realize that it was filmed in Santa Cruz and I wonder if it was the project of someone's film school. I wish I had given it a better review, but honestly, it was a frustrating and disappointing loss of an hour and a half.
