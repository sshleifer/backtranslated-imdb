I was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city ... I was younger then ... but it was an excellent play ... so could someone, please, tell me why the hell they had to make a movie out of Is .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He did not adapt to the role ... this movie really stunk the BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT to rent this movie ... save money for something better like "Cats" ...
