It mixes exotic tropical places, babies with tiny outfits, explosions, Dudley Do-Right clones of good looks, a movie star with his best years behind (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts and a sexy villain (Tracy Lor ... .er, I'm sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you'd think you'd be in an escapist fun. Not so! This is a dreary television movie and although she likes to promote herself as a "Charlie's Angels" deal, she is not nearly as good as the original series or even the sheaf, irremediably stupid, recent C.A. films. This abomination is best described as a film by Andy Sidaris of THIRD VALUE. It's not as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii," although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. The girls spend too much time posing and trying to look too delicate and after a while it becomes annoying. There are better gender things than this out there. Oh yes, and the "babies" are not as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
