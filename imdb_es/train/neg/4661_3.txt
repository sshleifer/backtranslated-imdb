This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious movie from World War II, and it serves as a statement about racism. It is worth looking to understand the fact that films reflect how we feel about problems when they occur and not about the period of time they portray. Which means that this is a movie from the 70s, not a movie from the 40s (WW2). However, there are some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a prey. The story centers on the fact that the Captain learns that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a World War II film that reflects what the film is about. The Black Lieutenant gives a German woman an innocent kiss on the cheek, and the White Captain gets angry. I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity point of view since the stars and the genre interested me.
