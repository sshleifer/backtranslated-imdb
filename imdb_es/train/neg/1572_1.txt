It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Terrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (it is evident that the cars travel slowly), atrocious scripts, appallingly unsatisfying end and incompetent direction make the hash of a movie. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is not a lot of tension inside the car and, when the characters encounter moments of hope, they laugh like crazy banshees for some reason, even when they are five years old when they see that the bridge is low! <br /> <br /> In addition, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same credibility of cars. Apparently based on true facts, however? If that is the case, the truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Regrettable then, that he was portrayed in such an inept manner.
