I can not believe that so many are comparing this film with Argento's. His work is much more imaginative and vicious, and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply lacks the ability to create real tension. The scenes of murder, and let's face it, that's what this genre is about, they're not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the killer was, and I really did not care when he revealed himself. The cinematography is not memorable, and the praised Gothic atmosphere of the 19th century simply did not appeal to me. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the director and the sadistic girl who lords over the younger students), but they are given very little to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are nuances of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add very little spice or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
