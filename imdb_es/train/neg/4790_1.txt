I hated this movie. The original Ghost had such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror films of the 70s, it looked and felt like a chilling and unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, of the late 80s, drove the action, but kept this good attention to the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is simply horrible. Tediously explains all the strange events of previous films, which diminish rather than expand their power. It shamelessly degrades the images of the first Ghost as a cheap recreation of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more domestic pests than threatening orbs. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the shot. Nobody, the prop master, the PD, the editor, the director, realized or cared that they looked so malicious? Worse yet, Phantasm III presents a cheesy and graceless joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first movie. The original Phantom used humor to alleviate his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to establish countless cheap jokes about Reggie's tenderness: several refer to the "flying balls" of the film, ha, oh, I understand, balls. Maybe the crew got angry with these jokes, but they are on us.
