I spent eight years running theaters in the 80s and 90s. This was, by far, the worst movie I've ever shown to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it resulted in trying to be a great inspirational movie. Even the great Gregory Peck could not prevent this horrible piece of nonsense from being much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in a previous role in a movie without horror, clearly showed that he had not yet learned to act (he is still trying, but he is not improving much). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. And here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid of playing minor league baseball! Even the Nick and The Disney Channel shows are not stupid enough to try to make the dreck believe. <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time you would lose watching it on cable TV. It's not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar would be better spent on an additional package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it can only be better than this).
