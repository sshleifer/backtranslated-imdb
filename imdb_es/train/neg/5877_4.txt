Williamson's accent is hard to understand. He talks incredibly fast, as if he were in a hurry to cross the lines. During soliloquies, he acts as if he is talking to someone, when he is supposed to be talking to himself. All that and his bald just bothered me. He was too old for this role. When reading other Williamson's stories, maybe he got this role because he was crazy and the director decided to do a bit of imitation acting of life art or forced method. When the actors declare Hamlet angry, you believe it! Marianne Faithful is an awesome beauty and could ruin Ophelia's role and still get a pass. The stage is dark and preconceived, but it seems as if it were filmed in a royal castle, especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
