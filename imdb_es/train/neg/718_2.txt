The main reason why people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." It is that it has Peter Sellers in a second invoice paper. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers plays Amphibulos, a vague reptilian Prime Minister of the poor island nation of Gaillardia, a former British colony, which now houses many Russians. excavators during the height of the cold war. Amphibulos wants to play the interests of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union with each other for easy wins, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table." Terry-Thomas is the main character, a lazy British diplomat eager to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, they all seem to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> A positive criticism here says: "The reason for this movie is considered average is because the comedy is underestimated." I would say that the reason why "Carlton-Browne" is considered inferior to the average is because comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that establishes the only two strengths of the movie, a terry-Thomas sympathetically naughty. and the larky score of John Addison, things slow down quickly in a series of slow burns and jokes of miscommunication. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne on the part of his boss and the darkness of Gaillardia (which no one can find on a map) dies to death. When we arrive on the island (after a series of dizzy jokes), expectations are quite low. <br /> <br /> They are still too tall. The island itself, which seems to exist in Latin America or the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that its honor guard faints at the airport, and the checkpoint collapses in the middle of a parade. Apparently, the army is still pulled by horses, which allows another speaker with a thick accent to take it: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never occupy a central place even when we're on the island of their character. The plot is assumed by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen is boring and does his paper as straight as it is written. Normally, this would make him the likely target for stealing scenes from Sellers, but stuck behind a thick accent and greasy mustache, Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him much happier in two other movies made this same year. "The Mouse That Roared" and "I'm All Right, Jack." <br /> <br /> It's strange that this movie, like "Jack", was a Boulting Brothers production, with Roy Boulting here as co-director with Jeffrey Dell. Generally, Boulting's films combine evil social satire with comedy of everything, but here there are only punches in both directions. Amphibulos operates his shattered English vibe for all its value ("This man is like, how do you say, the bull in the Chinese ship") while Carlton-Browne is generally mistreated by his superior far more than he seems to deserve? <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest element of the film is the romance of young Loris with Ilyena. Score a point to be interpreted by the dazzling Luciana Paluzzi, and the fact that they are apparently cousins ​​is never addressed. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a sparse and staged revolution whose surprising resolution will not surprise anyone, and a bit of Carlton-Browne's final action that seems to literally nail the lid of his coffin. Apparently, he lives to see another day, but the movie of the same name is strictly DOA.
