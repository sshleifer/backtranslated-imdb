I will never be a member of any club that has me, <br /> <br /> especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mother / stripper who is attacked by a <br /> <br /> Vampire Woman and left for dead. She starts to feel like <br /> <br /> blood, and runs into John Savage, looking <br /> <br /> wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants to allow Andreef to join his little vampire <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vampire, the blond vampire who <br /> <br /> attacked Starr, and a green-haired dwarf (I'm not doing this <br /> <br /> above). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> <br /> and Starr's son. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his time on the screen displaying more facial tics than <br /> <br /> Hugh Grant in a Jolt Cola folder, and reads all his lines as <br /> <br /> He's making a movie of Farrelly Brothers. Andreeff tries to make <br /> <br /> most of a badly written paper, but screenwriter / director Ruben goes <br /> <br /> for all the vampire clich√©s, like Starr eating the pet hamster of your child <br /> <br /> and buying a lot of raw meat to combat the craving for blood. The child <br /> <br /> is also beaten a lot, for those who think that seeing violence against children is really entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely bloody, but not wildly, above as "Killer <br /> <br /> Language". Here, the gore is rude and never justified, it just happens. <br /> <br /> You're alone in the budget. Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff's coworkers <br /> <br />, who go through shameful stripper routines at the bottom <br /> <br /> of the conversation scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire fangs! All vampires must stab their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> An ingenious idea, unless you've already seen George Romero <br /> <br /> "Martin". <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes, and once it launches Ruben's attempts in the direction <br /> <br /> (skewed frames, blurred scenes), this is a heavy, boring and dirty journey . Leave this club and take a shower, <br /> <br /> you will need it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, violence with firearms, sexual <br /> <br /> violence, strong gore, strong blasphemy, female nudity, sexual references, abuse of drugs and adult situations. <br /> <br />
