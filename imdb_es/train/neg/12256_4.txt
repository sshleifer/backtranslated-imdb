Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or 12 years old, (do not ask how) I may have been young, but I was not stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, unpleasant, disgusting, thoughtless and very silly. I have seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I have seen better performances in a school play, and I have seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit on the water, ignoring the children who touch the glass. . <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the north of Australia. A handful of ambitious youngsters are trying a new water sport, surfing in waters full of sharks. It soon becomes clear that there is something more dangerous in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grayish middle-aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to take revenge for eating his family. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen all the crocodile movies made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst crocodile movie, I think, with Primeval and Crocodile followed closely. <br /> <br /> The Australian saltwater crododil is one of the most dangerous creatures in the world, resulting in more than a hundred. Injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf, however, ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the life of the spectator. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
