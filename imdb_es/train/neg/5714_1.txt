I have seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and movies with a darker tone, but this one stinks. The director seems to be a sadist, who got someone to produce some scrap metal. The movie lacks entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone really made a movie like that. Although acting is fine, the story line and the feeling that it is going is horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'm not going to see any films by this director. It makes no sense to make movies, and a complete disappointment to have moments of suspense. All he has is showing scenes with psychopaths wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more thought of blood and violence that makes it exciting. Very disappointing movie and I highly recommend skipping all movies of this type.
