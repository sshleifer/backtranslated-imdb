Poor Paul Mercury. After playing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best movie in history, he managed to make a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this movie is very unpleasant, not even hateful, but Mercury's leadership is the kind of person you'd rather ignore: completely unbearable and use OVERALLS. Big mistake in costume design, that.
