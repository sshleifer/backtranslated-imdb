By far, the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure", but that it was changed to "Shark of the Sharks" to take advantage of the emotion created by "Jaws". I think the sharks were in a scene from this movie; The fact that they were included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. It did not work. Every time something "good" happens in the movie, the crew of the ship is provided with a certain beer brand that was just presented at the time the movie was made. Wow, do you think the beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made it more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is if they manage to overcome this. That is reason enough for the celebration.
