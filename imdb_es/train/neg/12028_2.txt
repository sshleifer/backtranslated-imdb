I agree with all the people above who said something that will convince you not to waste a moment of the briefest watching this amazingly amateur movie. Very poor performance, improvised production values, completely pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inanimate that it should never have been written, much less produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad job. The races should, on the contrary, have FINISHED by this inconsequential turn. <br /> <br /> OTH, there's something fascinating about seeing something so amazing. And Chad Lowe is terribly bad.
