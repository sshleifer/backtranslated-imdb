WARNING! THE DETAILS OF THE PLOT ARE REVEALED! <br /> <br /> I can not find practically anything positive to say about this movie. It is so badly written that each character is a caricature, but it seems to be taken seriously. It is poorly distributed, especially Ralph Macchio (all with baby face, 5 feet-nothing of him) like a street nut. The elements of the plot are drawn in black and white, with each situation almost immediately reaching an extreme climax. <br /> <br /> The most atrocious of all (ELEMENT OF THE PLOT THAT MUST BE REVEALED) has perhaps the most gratuitous and artificial nude. Scene in the history of semi-serious cinema. One can only imagine the filmmakers saying, "We need JoBeth to shed his top ... hmmm ... I got it! ... At the beginning of the movie, we give Nick a ridiculous dialogue about undressing in the corridors ... then JoBeth can use that line with him later and REALLY got undressed in the hallway ... yeah, that's the ticket. "<br /> <br /> I'll give credit to the producers for tackling a important issue in 1984, One that was very heavy at the end of the 90 with events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrible. This film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of "Heathers", a political statement like "Network" or a serious test like "Brubaker". Instead, try to be all these things, and end up being none of these things. The "teachers" get an F.
