Mary Pickford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has an affair. As the commentator Snow Leopard said, the movie is somewhat episodic to begin with. Some of them are funny, like Pickford whipping his clan members in the church, while others are there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the plot of the devised and recycled romance and its climax. The transfer is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the landscape, but even taking that into account, this does not seem to be the best work of director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated one more time on the species 'The Poor Little Rich Girl', something more accessible, typifying Pickford as a child character.
