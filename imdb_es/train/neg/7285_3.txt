The sun should be in this movie, forever. <br /> <br /> It turns on forever (which is not usually a bad thing: the English patient, Schindler's list) but it is TED BOTH. The aging of the actors is incredible and so is the endless storyline that never seems to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a loss of talent and cinema.
