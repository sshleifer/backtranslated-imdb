I can not believe how incomprehensible this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, except it's with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that's supposed to be a partner. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but this is complete stupidity. Not only is there no argument for this movie. It's like seeing someone who pretends to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words as if they were chiefs of staff at a major medical center. Also, people are wearing clothes that are not suitable for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a movie "b" from the girls in the valley, in space.
