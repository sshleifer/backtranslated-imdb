Confess that you have fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty difficult admission for a heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Maybe it's that extra something famous that everyone talks about and makes a star a star. Cross that barrier. It pushes you into unknown, sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in his favor, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, of course, James Dean and, more recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. The women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, with just one hand, has redefined the concept. He is the only reason to get out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, buy popcorn and go to a theater to see "Troy". If you liked the epics in the style of "Jupiter's Darling", you can enjoy this. But if he does not, stay the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
