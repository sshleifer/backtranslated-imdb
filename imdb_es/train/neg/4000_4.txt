I enjoyed "American Movie," so I rented Chris Smith's first film, which I also thought was a documentary. In the first minute I saw that it was not, but I tried. <br /> <br /> What a dead end movie. Being faithful to life hardly serves you if you are simply going to examine the tedios, especially. Tediety with which we are already familiar. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but will it be relevant for ANYONE that 1) many jobs are stilted and 2) most of them are precious, minimum wage jobs in the service sector? I knew it before I saw the movie. Anyway, it did not really provide an examination of that, because while the film strives to feel "real" (handheld camera, without music, etc.), what is happening does not reproduce as it would in the " real world". br /> <br /> Would a employer be so happy with Randy when he withdrew his check, after Randy quit him after 3 days when the man said he expected him to stay 6 months? Or the day after leaving his job (and ruining the machine he was working on), would everyone be so easy with him? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. . This guy is a loser. Not because you are stuck in these jobs, or have an unpleasant apartment, or look like one. He is a fool. He does not pay attention or does not really try these jobs. He has zero personality. If I had to hire someone, he would not do it after the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Chris Smith doing the following, but boys, remove the "this is a and important movie things." American Job "does not work.
