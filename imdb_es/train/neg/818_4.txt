This movie is remarkable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' series, this low-budget feature was made and launched into theaters, scoring George Reeves and Phyllis Coates. Early appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the city of Silby, a six-mile-deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth', allowing the 'Mole-Men' to surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force to preach and reinforce tolerance and acceptance of the difference. against a furious mob of segregationist vigilantes. There is no 'educated reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and assertive, takes control of the situation ("I'll take care of this!"), Even assisting in a hospital gown in extracting a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark towards the fighter Lois, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he criticizes the vigilantes as "Nazi stormtroopers". <br /> <br /> Third, you'll notice that the transition from Superman's Fleisher animated cartoon flight in the two series to the "live action" that flew in the "Superman's Adventures" has not yet it has been done.
