This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book ruined by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. There is no argument, the frames disappear and the editing is horrible. To make matters worse, the music is directly from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly terrible. The performance of Bridget Fonda is decent, but the performance of everyone else is totally amateur. I would suggest this film to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a film, as it is full of bad scenes, bad transitions and performances that should have been relaunched. Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
