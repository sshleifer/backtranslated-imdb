This was one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I generally praise any movie for some aspect of its production, but the extremely irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate it. any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common was the conclusion that the guy who designed the building was to blame for an avalanche that brought it down. Er ok. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to ski a slalom-style avalanche will not work. Running 10 feet on some trees will not work. Unfortunately he does here. As mentioned before, the innate stupidity and stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In a closed space, with limited oxygen, a four-year-old could tell you that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the film is redeemed and acquires some appreciation. However, if you have a minimum of intelligence, you will also find it difficult to tolerate most of this movie. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that so many quality stories are not published and yet, someone will pay for things like this. fact. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give it a hook, you must keep watching to see the latest in combat avalanche techniques. Absolutely invaluable.
