Who likes the scary "comedies" like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two types of people I can see this are: One, Muslims and self-proclaimed liberal advocates of all ethnic groups who are so excited that there is a show about Muslims that it does not even matter if the show is good. Or funny at all (which is not). Two, elderly people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, obsolete jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC really needs to take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If you just keep writing comedy for really old people, then guess what will happen, your audience will die soon and you will not have more audience. Would it be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think they are really Muslims, or fun and modern young people? No, I bet they're old white guys who've been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you watch the CBC comedy shows out there, Air Farce was only finally finally out of the air (thank God!) But we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer for which we are paying, not to mention this poor excuse for the "comedy" Little Mosque on the Prairie. Is it supposed to be offensive and funny? Only the CBC would think that this boring show is not at all offensive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on programs that only a few people bother to see.
