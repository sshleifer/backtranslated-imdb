Waiting to enter the theater with tickets in hand, I was expecting an interesting science fiction fantasy movie that could finally feed my appetite for films related to robot technology, instead I was disappointed by every aspect of it, once more demonstrating that amazing specialty Effects can not help a boring plot, which in my opinion was the worst in this year. Acting in this movie also made me feel dissatisfied, Will Smith did not show anything new in this movie, but I never saw his performance change from "Men In Black", which in his opinion was his only success. He had to retire since then, not ruining his name with titles like "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
