"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King has written a script. Considering this, and the excellent song of Santo and Johnny that they used as the theme of the film, you would be expecting a strange and, ultimately, satisfactory visual experience. Unfortunately, that is not what you would get. The thing is, they probably could have made a good movie. The start is intriguing, with its spooky small town atmosphere. But something strange happens at 20 minutes in the movie. The movie becomes fun for no apparent reason! As of that moment, the whole environment of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined. For those of you who have seen it, you can forget old Johnny yelling "COP KABOB !!" After sticking the pencil in that policeman's ear?!? But do not get me wrong, humor does not have a quality of redemption. I just rented it again to see if mabye was wrong the first time, given how original the plot sounded, but she was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe they got the rights to that Santo & Johnny song. I gave this a 2.
