I discovered this movie with a retailer that sold OOP's. And this is surely an OOP. A year after The Exorcist, she is back in business with this movie, but what we all know was that Blair's career never broke, never became a mega star. That is one of the reasons why many of his films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It is a rejection not recognized by their parents and has no friends. He played at age 15 playing with a girl of 14, that's funny. The film is also known for the scene of rape in the showers, where they put a broom in their virginity. In most editions it's cut out, I do not know, there's no blood involved, it's okay, Blair is naked but nothing is shown, there's no T & A, so there's nothing that offends people. But the movie is slow, extremely slow. It usually does not make me happy, but I almost feel asleep. It's about that 14-year-old boy becoming a rebel against society, but no blood flows, no gore or anything. Why this is classified in horror is still a wonder to me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it, otherwise, leave it as is.
