This comedy has some pretty funny things, surrounded by a lot of things without grace. Almost all the scenes involving the castle servants and their nonsense are a waste of time. And the layout is so careless that it makes you wonder if you really had a script ready before you started filming this, or just invented everything as you went along. (* 1/2)
