"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about movies since "The Exorcist", I think. Seeing how EVP is supposedly true, really had an easy passage to be a truly feared fact. There are not many movies that really instill fear in the minds of people. Like I said, this movie could have done it, but it did not. The film degraded itself to a low-class scary movie PG-13. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" in any way. Someone really needs to take over the horror film industry and make a movie that not only makes us think, but makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. Honestly I'm sick of the horror genre PG-13, because it's becoming a genre of its own. We need the old days, the days of blood and blood, the days of Freddy Kruger, Jason, The Mike Myers. Few films can suggest that this mentality is not so terrifying. So, why try to achieve it? A few jumps in this movie are just one of the most stupid endings in the history of the film without any resolution ... do not waste your money on this movie.
