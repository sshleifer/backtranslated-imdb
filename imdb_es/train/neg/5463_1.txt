Years ago I saw Arthur (the TV series and the books) and I never really liked the program (if you're a fan of this cartoon, forgive me if I'm spoiling you, but it's really what I think). A lot of people liked it, but I did not like it. <br /> <br /> The characters of the school children seemed to be fighting all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were kind to each other frequently, but gradually grew weary of Arthur's plaintive attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (however, the name was spelled), and DW was an ADHD (or ADD), like Arthur's 4-year-old sister who was sometimes picky (which could be the reason why Arthur got annoyed by what were her routines, like her imaginary friend and her collection of stuffed animals, etc.), Arthur's friends acted as teenagers instead of what they were in Arthur's books, and the parents, well, did not care much . <br /> <br /> The best caricature was Rocko's modern life, not Arthur (no offense).
