A rich Harvard man falls in love with a poor Radcliffe chick to the dismay of his strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> A sybaritic, sugary story and, above all, a battle of "classes" when wealthy kid Ryan O'Neal brings home the plunder of a librarian who is ridiculed by his snobby parents. Ali MacGraw is the socially homeless with a dirty mouth, while John Marley plays his devout Catholic father, but no one in the film is more upset than O'Neal with his portrayal as the yuppie Harvard champion. <br /> <br /> Followed 8 (!) Years later by 'The Story of Oliver'.
