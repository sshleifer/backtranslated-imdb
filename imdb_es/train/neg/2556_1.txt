Well, everything has been said about this film and I hate writing reviews in which everyone else has already said what needs to be said. But the point is that I've seen billions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews about all the movies I've seen. Then, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The acting is stupid. It's really stupid how the news anchor expresses his sadness about the plane crash. However, the nun is nice and the professional assistant comes to take care of the child. The three main murders in the film are so weak that one wonders how stupid the creators of this film can be. Do not they realize that even scams can be scary? We do not see how grandpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, just do not like them. And Uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have worked better. We only hear him scream and we do not see anything!
