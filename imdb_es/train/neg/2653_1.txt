I could not believe how horrible this movie was; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought: "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I'm corrected. All the people involved should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I realize that there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the script for this was so inept, clich√© and disconcerting that I am surprised that it was ever put into development or that the Mrs. Keaton thought I could make a silk bag with the ear of this sow. None of the characters had a bit of credibility and they were so incredibly unpleasant. The performance resembled the exercises in a BEGINNING class. I stared in horror and with my mouth open for most of this question: "What were you thinking?" Very, very sad that it has come to this. Do not waste your time.
