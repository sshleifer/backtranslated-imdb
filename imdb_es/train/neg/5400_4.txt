This is just a small gore festival based on a story by Stephen King. Two tabloid reporters, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so accomplished (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can really be a vampire. Stranger than strange is this modern blood sucker who does not advance in his way naturally, but through a black Cessna he looks for his victims. The blood becomes really frightening when the movie comes close to its stupid ending. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a little scary in the early hours of the night.
