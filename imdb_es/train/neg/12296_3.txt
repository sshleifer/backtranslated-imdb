A very bad movie, with very few good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> Start with the pregnant Linda Blair, who runs through the corridors to flee from what could be monsters or people with pitchforks, I'm not sure. Jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see that she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and an annoying and possibly retarded child that I thought was her son, travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find children more irritating to put in their movies! On the island are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff ...). He is taking pictures, and is translating an esoteric German book about witches, I think. <br /> <br /> They also travel to the island an older couple who bought it, a real estate agent and a woman, I thought. It was her daughter. Obviously, she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the children of the older couple. I guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed that Linda and the boy were separated from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems clean, certainly from the outside, but is not used to any great effect. An old woman with bad makeup and a black cape keeps appearing to the child and sometimes sings something in German, which eventually records on her Sesame Street recorder. <br /> <br /> People start to be killed, either in their dreams. , or aspired to hell or something. Some of these scenes are fine, but not enough to recommend the movie. Although the copy I saw said that it had not been cut in the cover of the box, the death of a character whose veins explode seems to have been cut. Much of the scene shows the reaction shots of another character, since we are not seeing anything by ourselves. The most spooky scene is one in which a man or a demon with a really messy mouth wound violates someone. It seemed particularly unpleasant. There is a ridiculous and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I would like it if a horror film presented her, they would do something original with her role, and they would let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the annual horror conventions). <br /> <br /> In the strange, largely Italian, tradition of claiming that it is a sequel to something with which it is unrelated, this is also AKA The 4th House and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to House 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - is not (that's also a better movie than this one). House 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987), again unrelated to Witchery and The House 3 (and much better than those). There is also a House 5, The (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to be a sequel to the fake series The House and the House series: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) ) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How does The Horror Show fit in there? Not really, it was said to be a sequel, so it is required that the entry of the real series be renumbered to cause less (or more) confusion. Interestingly, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and The House 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head still hurt?
