I have seen many horror films in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none of them reaches the depths to which this garbage is reduced. This movie made me more and more angry when I saw her while trying to understand exactly what this movie was about. Now, after having seen it, I understand, more or less, what happened and why, but the film itself is too confusing to be funny when you're watching it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of gratuitous violence, of a single line that show the comprehension capacity of his characters ("The road belongs to me ... ME!"), And enough nudity to distract us enough from the " plot". ", but still, he will leave this film alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy that is no longer wanted and left in a box on the side of the road.
