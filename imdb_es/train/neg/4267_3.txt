I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as presumably all the other voters. The Director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and very committed to the project, which I think explains the reception and the qualification that they obtained above the average. It is more similar to a long episode of the favorite version of the Australian children "Round the Twist", but it takes too seriously to have even that redeeming feature. Maybe it's worth watching the movie itself. If you are trying to make a world cinema tour visiting all the member states of the UN, since I can not think of another Fijian film, but in general it was generic, badly acted (even by a cast of fans) and prey to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that the native islanders will try to deceive each other, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to intervene in, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
