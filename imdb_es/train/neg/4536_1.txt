This film is no more than a religious stretch that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age occultism disguised with Western images to be swallowed up by those who ignore fundamental religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both now and in the 1600s) obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield has tried to mix Eastern mysticism with Western Christianity. Their attempt at syncretism can deceive or confuse those who do not seek the truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As the ad used to say in old Berkeley Barb for $ 10.00, we will show you how to start your own religion. As one famous prophet said: "Use force Lucas".
