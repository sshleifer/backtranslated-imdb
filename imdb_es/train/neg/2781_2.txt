This is a film that tries to retell the history of Thailand, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with many Thai films I've seen and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors who speak Thai madness and martial arts. Well, it's nothing like that. This movie is shot entirely in English, it's full of Anglo actors, and it has such terrible production values ​​that it's ridiculously bad ... but it's not funny! Who can we blame for this crap? The acting, the dialogue, and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some of the fight scenes seemed to have been choreographed by the local high school theater club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but some were simply a cheap animation placed on the screen that provided a particularly cheesy effect. It has a great epic-style outdoor battle scene, where a few thousand extras can run through a disguised field, but when we see the two armies collide in combat: HA! What a joke! The movie has a couple of beauties. What a pity they did not show a little more skin. At least that would have been something for the boys to appreciate. Do not bother yourself
