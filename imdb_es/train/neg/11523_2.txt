"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally inept and amateur attempt at a crazy horror movie hippie-cult-killing-spree. Apparently, almost twenty years later, Charles Manson continued to inspire the most enthusiastic but incompetent garbage filmmakers. This is a typical production of Troma, that is, there are many boring and totally irrelevant filler images that accompany the plot without meaning. Is there some random blood and free nudity on the screen? which is not bad ?? but everything is so useless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that he's even using a lot of images twice, like the circle he saw killing, for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult led by the drug addict and the aspiring Charlie Manson Paul. One of Paul's lower-order disciples, named Igor, becomes a little obsessed with biblical stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the whole cult to descend even further into criminal madness. Just to illustrate through a small example, just how crazy Igor is: rips the heart out of the chest of a really sexy black hitchhiker girl! There is an annoying synth soundtrack and some truly embarrassing pseudo-artistic camera tricks, such as slow-motion sequences and spooky dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that more or less qualifies as something worthwhile for junk fanatics and that is when a poor girl cuts herself in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera keeps firing the blade in the bloody stomach for fifteen full seconds.
