I've seen anime but I'm not a fan of die hard; And I do not read manga. I say this because many of the critics who are getting lyrical about this movie seem to have that background. I have seen "St. John's Wort", and although it is not a masterpiece by the style of the imagination, it made me catch "Shinobi", especially because everyone seems to like it. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it this afternoon, and I fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it is very beautiful: the water scenes in slow motion, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the flickering of the CGI eye, majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was boring as dirt. <br /> <br /> It seemed that someone took "Romeo and Juliet", the translation even mentions that they are The lovers of the stars crossed - and launched some "X-Men" just in case. Two of the characters divided Wolverine's powers: the man in a bear suit had his claws and the gray-haired boy had the ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poisonous kiss, that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such foolish powers? The poisonous girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Man, that is a great power for you. And the other girl, she can create insects from this yellow powder that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the stars of the crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic look. Wow <br /> <br /> In a way, I came to the end of the film with a quick advance and saw a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this with "The House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero." Do not make that mistake. They can share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur, the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are between 12 and 18 years old.
