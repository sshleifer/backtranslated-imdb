Do not even waste your time, let alone pay the rent for this piece of dreck! How it was done is beyond me. (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I've already summarized this film of poor quality, but, well ...) The performance was horrible, as if everyone needed lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think that the cinematography was the only thing that did not stink at all ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist. The only good thing is that, if you could make this movie, even earn some money with it, there may be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea. So, everyone take the heart! I guess the same thing applies to the actors ... if these people get paid, you can too!
