To quote the film, "it's better not to know, better still to forget, the best thing is to be abandoned." Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical improvements of a Hollywood horror movie, but a horribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel like they preach to you. the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's as if the cumulative character dialogue of the writers could be summed up in a bad police television and a Jerry Springer program. Maybe it's appropriate for a movie like The Hitcher, not a horror movie set in Russia. The result is that a potentially grandiose scenario and some potentially bloody scenes are wasted and foolish, not scary or meaningful.
