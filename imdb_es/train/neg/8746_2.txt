An obvious attack on Microsoft made by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or market economies in general. <br /> <br /> Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious cartoon of bill gates, and is a corporate cartoon villain who orders right and left killings. <br /> <br /> Although Microsoft can participate in some anticompetitive activity at times, it is unlikely that they will actually murder people. Therefore, the film is exaggerated and ridiculous from the start. <br /> <br /> The "deepest" point is apparently that the main technological innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most important innovations would never have developed if not for the incentives (and rewards) of the market offered by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> One thing is to oppose anti-competitive behavior: - That's common sense. Another very different is to oppose the competition of the market in the first place, which is what the movie mantra represents ("knowledge belongs to humanity"). <br /> <br /> Another example that Hollywood is completely out of touch with reality. .
