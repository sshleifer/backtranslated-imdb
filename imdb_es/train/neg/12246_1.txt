*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you reviewed the movie based solely on the premise, you might think you were watching an average animal-oriented horror movie. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers head to an island to shoot a documentary about surfing with sharks or surfing with blood. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf"). It is true that this seems to have behind a rather interesting idea that, if it were explored more, could have improved the film a little. However, this is not the case, since the part of the film that is surfed by blood is minimal because its documentary is interrupted by a large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is that when someone eats for the crocodile, which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to care. Most of what anyone did in the movie was simply to toast the victim in a scene that should have been touching, but it ended up being ridiculous due to the fact that the dialogue in this movie was of a very dubious nature. Another thing that really irritates this movie is the fact that they introduce characters that are totally superfluous from the movie itself. They present a group of pirates who can only be seen as adding another 10 minutes to a merciful short film. <br /> <br /> You can say that the acting is mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work with. In short, there is not a person who has had a terrible impact on me. Each person seemed to be a watered-down caricature and, in this way, none of these actors had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile is huge, with more than 31 feet exactly. and this sensation of size is well represented by the obvious forgery of a crocodile that we have been given in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously false and artificial that it makes the stomach turn. With a great shout of bravado, the hero of the movie announces that he has a plan that turns out to be falling downhill and causing the crocodile to be impaled on a spike placed fortunately at the bottom of this mentioned hill. <Br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this movie should be seen so that you can believe how bad it can be. What probably seemed like a good idea at that time suffered a terrible script and an overwhelming feeling of low budget that served to create a truly horrible movie.
