Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the extraordinary psychic Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, has been resurrected with The First Power (... given by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber) and can possess The bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (... who has an understanding of what they face), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in their bloody hands. They will seek the help of Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing ... a cross with a leaf that can penetrate the Heart of Channing ridding the world of its evil. She'll take it anyway and give Russell a hand, who will need all the help she can get when Channing kidnaps her and prepares her for some kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable supporting actor, receives the role of Russell's partner ... so you know what will happen to him. As in movies of this kind, everyone who is close to Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he is simply murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses. <br /> <br /> Pure hidden garbage ... stupid The entrance door to the goal. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a movie like this they have no chance. Kober, who is usually as effective as the heavy one, is really nothing more than a foolish villain who jumps in the air and throws rotten jokes.
