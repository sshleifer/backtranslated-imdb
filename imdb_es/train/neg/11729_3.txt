Virgin is selected to marry a rich boy. Rich guy urinates. Woman in boat likes sailor. The sailor urinates. Virgin attends the dinner of the commune. The man urinates on the dinner table. Boatwoman does strip tease for little kids. Man pretending to be baby urine. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he is lost in the world. To say that this is a strange movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who barely speaks ten lines throughout the film, bathes in chocolate syrup. In fact, it's a sweet scene, but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth, unless you share the director's fetishes.
