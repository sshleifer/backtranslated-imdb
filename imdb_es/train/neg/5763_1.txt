<br /> <br /> "A step aside for Hollywood veterans?" (It was "asked" to the Wayan brothers) that's what Hollyweird demanded and that's what he got. However, like many of his recent decisions, this was a big mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is SO out of touch with the audience of today, trying to regain physical sympathies and jokes instead of funny dialogue is simply a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did you never consider changing the director? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played as two of the four main characters, without them it's just a farce and another sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
