['This has to be the stupidest movie I&#39;ve seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little boy is weird and they move to a hotel because his father takes care of him. We find that the child has a gift, the &quot;Brillo&quot;. This gift never has anything to do with anything except make the child look good. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the boy and his wife because ... well, he wants to do it. Why else would he? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bathtub. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a corpse, which is absolutely disgusting. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then, the boy and the woman take the vehicle of the black man and leave the father, who dies within a few minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a total waste of time, but this falls into that category. The music is of poor quality, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is crooked and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the story is slow, tedious and boring . This movie is very overrated. Avoid this movie at any cost. I am surprised that you have obtained such a high rating in IMDb.']
