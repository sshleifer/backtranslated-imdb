The wonderful "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had so much hope for the actress, and then went from being bad to obviously WORSE in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it was the '80s and I must tell you that Harold Robbin's work had been overshadowed by smarter writers. . Jacqueline Susann got angry with him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work reached many women and, of course, Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom at the end of the 80s and then came Jackie Collins, who made the stronger and equal women. Men in every way in their books, more so. That's why this job smells. Harold Robbin's work in the 1980s simply did not reach the public. The performance of Pia Zadora in one of Robbin's works was like throwing kerosene on fire. The cast of support was not a help either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... this was horrible to watch at that moment and even 20 years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and everything went off when this was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters who introduced her in "Hairspray" was a spark), although she has a good singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..The spray can go on tour! Join the show. You may be the most important story back yet. <br /> <br /> I just hope you burn this movie if you do it.
