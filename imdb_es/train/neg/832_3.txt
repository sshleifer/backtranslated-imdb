I give this movie the details that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. But I could not overcome the implausibility of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First of all, a game created around the notion of "Russian roulette" that has to be filled in an hour. The big problem is that if you are doing a "live" show, you run the possibility that your first participant is the one who has the bad luck to get the "real" bullet. What will you do next? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that it's okay, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means that number six has the bullet and can not get paid. He is not going to shoot himself at that moment, so it's a bit anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> second problem, almost as big. The human nature People will shudder, panic, dirty their underwear and do things that otherwise would not be good television. Too much randomness That is the reason why "real" reality television is actually written and even tighter. <br /> <br /> (The only thing at random is the "performance artist" tirade about female sacrifices, which were actually historically rare, predictable, since she shot herself without any effect.) < br /> <br /> We are led to believe that the ratings of the programs will increase while it lasted at 1 AM in the morning (unlikely) with the Asian token. Girl who announces each increase in the ratings. <br /> <br /> A point about race and sex. Big surprise are the films that survive two minorities (one gay) and two contestants. So we are left with the two white males, and of course, the least sympathetic of them is the one that buys them. The purpose of such a program would be its randomness, but the one that you least like is the one that dies. <br /> <br /> Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself. Actually, it raises awareness when someone dies, what did she think was going to happen? A passer-by shot him immediately, angry at the whole thing (the reasons were never explained) and the program became a great success Really? <br /> <br /> The problem with media satire is that it has to have some basis in reality or it must be so exaggerated to be ridiculous (like Red.) This is none.
