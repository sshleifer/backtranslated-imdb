This miniseries, also based on a book by Alex Haley as it was 'Queen', tried to use similar formulas, that is, built a long history following the life of a family for many years. While in 'Queen' the result was masterful, here in Mama Flora inspiration was lacking. First perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in this TV production. Too much time is put too quickly over the years, so that the saga that develops is superficial, superficial, not as authentic as in 'Queen'. An outstanding one for the staging in the previous parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, it seemed to degenerate into a kind of unpleasant dallasian-forsitimate mixture in the last third of its three hours or so duration. I expected more; but, evidently, Haley was less inspired with this story than his almost "biographical Queen", and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long stories of generations that grow.
