I decided to see him because he was nominated for an Oscar this year. I guess so many people here really wanted me to like this movie, but I ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the movie in "shaking hands" camera mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I suppose the main reason for making a movie of this type and nominating it for Oscar is as follows: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who make money in the war) urgently need an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq to confuse something (something) patriotic. <br /> <br /> why these "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to "inspire" the audience with an idea of ​​"love-like-a-drug war" ... Oh, Please let's go! how boring! <br /> <br /> Look at this to get an idea of ​​how low the film academy can fall ...
