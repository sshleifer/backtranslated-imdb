LOL! You just have to smile and smile if you really did it throughout the movie. I guess he says something about me. I think the movie itself was created as a kind of psychological test, or as a kind of drug, to take you to a place where you've never been. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical article, the tract (sp?), He said it did not make sense and that it did not make sense, but if he read it, once it finished, it would take it to a new level, like a ladder, and then I could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding. I think this movie is the same. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it is without doubt the worst movie I have seen in a long time in such a unique way. First of all, this is snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in several movies. and I have suffered through a few weak ones. However, although you know that the movie could stink, you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it really was. that's the fun of it. I mean, this is snipes. You know it can be good, but it will be fine, right? smile. <br /> <br /> so this on all levels is pure boredom, pure originality. The reference to the professional is both clear and obvious, but so poorly made as to be comical. There is not a character in this movie that is interesting, in the least. and to make everything more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts of several Bourne identity type movies, but it's not quite right. In fact, although it seems to be close to the background music of the action movie, it just so happens that it's done in a way that will pay off fantastically. <br /> <br /> then all the scenes in total black tone, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you really do not care what happens, but in spite of that, after it happens and someone he is murdered, he simply says to himself: am I supposed to see that? What else? What about the scenes with flashes, unpleasant flashes at a strobe rhythm, for a period of time that is too long to endure. Of course we're going to throw that away. How about this? When you try hard and your eyes can not take it anymore, do a little more of this in the dark where you can not see what happened. and on top of that, let's be honest, you do not care. You were very bored from the beginning. <br /> <br /> So I went in and out a couple of times, but I captured almost all of this movie. and it becomes something that you can see, without something that compromises your mind at any level, therefore, it becomes something that you can effectively dodge and start thinking about your life, where it goes, where it has gone, to what we are. people. <br /> <br /> and that ... that's the real magic of this movie.
