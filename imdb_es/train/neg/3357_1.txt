The way in which viewers react to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original film of 1963 (it is quite true), will be based, I believe, on the following: who were big fans of anyone The book or the original movie will not think much about this ... and those who have never been exposed, and who are big fans of the current Hollywood trend that "special effects" are the first and The last word on how "good" a movie is, you will love it. <br /> <br /> Things I did not like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was NOT a true adaptation of the book. Of the articles I had read, this film was supposed to cover other aspects of the book that the first never reached. And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word by word unless it's the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this movie that were never mentioned or insinuated into the movie. It reminded me of the way they decided to kill the black man in the original version of the movie THE SHINING. I did not like that either. What the press release of the film SHOULD have said is ... "We got the basic and very basic idea of ​​Shirley Jackson's book, we keep the same house names and several (though not all) of the names of the characters main, but then we decided to write our own story and, what the heck, we saw THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and we decided to include a bit of them too. " <br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the subject of a parapyschologist inviting a carefully selected guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that really seemed to have "been born wrong". No, on the other hand, this "doctor" took everyone home with the false pretext of studying his "insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like laboratory rats , whom he mentioned was never told they are part of an experiment ... good boy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original film as the night of the day. <br /> <br /> 3. In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both films, "some houses are just born wrong", this house was not born bad, but it was made bad by what happened there .. and, this time, Nel falls apart. The mystery (nuances of THE CHANGE). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was said so incoherently that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience ... but, first, there was no mystery (not in the book), because The House It was wrong to start. She is the first "victim" to die before putting her eyes on him. <br /> <br /> 4. The way in which the character of Lucas was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be an elegant playboy who would one day inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of his "story") ... and in this he was just a clumsy wine-nerd nerd who could not sleep (Insomnia remembers) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also bothered by the way the film jumped from almost trying to recreate the original scenes word by word (the scene with Nel's sister's family and the little opening speech of the Mrs. Dudley ...) to go to the fantasy flights that made me think. more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It's as if I could not decide what I wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nel's narrative throughout the movie. The original was like a Gothic novel in the way that the story was told primarily in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we were always aware of her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel a much more heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could it be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) And she liked to complain and lost patience. .. This was almost too good to be true. This was never more evident than in the climax of the movie where the writer had obviously been seeing GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house and it is too busy. There was no Abigail Crain (Hugh's daughter whose legend was great in the original versions), there was no "companion" and there was no daycare. There was also no "Grace" (wife of the original doctor) and the wives of Hugh Crain died in totally different ways. These changes, changed the story too much. I do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy that Shirley Jackson is not walking on this earth anymore or if they should ... WE ARE SORRY (if you understand me! ") The appearances that she could imagine are not something that can be played . with !!!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you some words from the original Luke (the proper substitution of the word "house" for "movie"!): "This 'movie' must be burned to the ground, and the I'm sprayed with salt! "My favorite movie of all time is still that way. There is no competition from this.
