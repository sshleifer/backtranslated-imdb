"Ask the Dust" seemed intriguing because of the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be considered a drama, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. Practically it seemed satirizar, and without entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this to improve, my wife and I went out, appreciating not having wasted any more time in that nonsense. It just was not interesting, touching, funny or artistic. It seems as if it was written, produced and directed by a high school child; Worst of all, it was such a shameful waste of extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
