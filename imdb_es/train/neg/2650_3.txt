When I sat under this televised mediocrity, I wondered why. Why did Dianne Keaton agree with this garbage? The film uses meaningless artificial raster lines to deliver garbage to homes of thousands of people. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film made no sense, and all credibility was lost by the excessive use of the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile, but in the end she needs to remember the old adage that you can not polish a turd. I hope you did not waste your New Year's Day watching another meaningless movie made for the television movie. Now I know why the chains began to broadcast series on Sunday night, to get rid of the garbage!
