Do you know how sometimes you can watch a fucking movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, this was beyond that. I bought the DVD on Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard that this was a movie you could laugh about. It really is nothing less than pathetic. Approximately 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we committed to move to the end, to see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching all the time in search of Matt Walsh). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It is more than painful.
