Like Freddy's revenge, this sequel takes a rather strange idea and does not make a big effort to squeeze a story. Basically, Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is obsessed with Freddy, which gives her an outlet to pursue her friends. This has the least number of deaths in the whole series and the cracks are pretty poor, so neither fans of horror nor comedy are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about this. It is moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but it is not worth watching a movie. Unconditional and inescapable, possibly only the direction of the competition prevents it from being the worst in the series.
