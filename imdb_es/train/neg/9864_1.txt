As a player, I can not say that I like this movie. The fact is that, of course, I hate him. I tried to see him with the most open mentality possible, but when it comes to something like that, I feel quite insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I have met many players, from all walks of life. I do not know anyone who acts like any of the characters in the movie. It is as if the producers of the film took the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most of the players are quite social people, some with quite active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is not suitable for the theme of the film. A real documentary about players would really work better. While it looks good (I.E. cleanly as a whole), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. The players trust it, I admit it, but we do not have Tourette Syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of humor. Although self-critical humor is one of the pillars of my group and other groups that I have met, this is less self-declaration and is more like the mood of the bathroom. In the same way, a great part of the humor of the gamers is full of jokes and anecdotes, not of toilet humor. Most players would resist and avoid anyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: the precision. I do not mean the rules, but the dynamics. Invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even smaller budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, which portray players as real people playing a real game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat nonsense players in front of The Gamers, where you can say something like: "Hey, I know a guy like that ... Yeah, he's definitely like Gary" . "
