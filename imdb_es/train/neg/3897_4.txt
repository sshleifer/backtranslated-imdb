The comedy worked has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigates a family of eccentric farms in Maryland that have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the tomboy farmer who squeezes the tax man not so disinterested. Debbie certainly did her share of lower theatrical comedies during this period, and this one is not better or worse than the rest. The image begins brightly, but it is marked halfway, it becomes frantic and ingenious. Randall is not a bad opponent for Reynolds, but the car itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a mix of poor sound that makes all the actors sound as if they were stuck in an echo chamber. ** since ****
