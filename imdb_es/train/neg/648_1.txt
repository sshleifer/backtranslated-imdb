The night of the prom: the most important night for any shallow girl composed almost completely of plastic. And so, the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when a tiny event occurred that assaulted the head in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There's really no excuse for Prom Night. There is nothing original about it and it would have really given zero or fewer stars if possible in IMDb. The only part of my vision that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of "ghosts". It was much more exciting than what was happening on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a guy who was in a riot. And the thing was, it was not even a slightly exciting fuss. Maybe if the guy had been remotely scary instead of a docile Robbie Williams with a baseball cap, he could have been sitting feeling somewhat anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than the color of the movie carpet did not contribute to the effect either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally unidimensional and alien. The hotel staff did not seem to notice or care that one of their maidens had disappeared and is further proof that a murderer is unrecognizable after having shaved. I was incredibly surprised that the mischievous and stereotyped girl in the blue dress was the only person who noticed who she was. She realizes this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, becomes entangled in a plastic sheet and then throws a lot of paint buckets. A beautiful one <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that he believed that the director was doing his best. He really pushed all the limits by not showing any murder that really happened. Shocking! And the music, do not make me start. It was almost as appropriate as getting naked at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to watch this movie. Conventional cinema seems to be going downhill and movies like this make the situation worse. If you feel the need to see this absolutely horrible movie, listen to my plea. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet to play ghosts.
