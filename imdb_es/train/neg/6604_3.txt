The first was the best. The second stunk because the dialogue was terrible. Although, the story was not so bad (in fact, all the story lines are good and bad). Throughout the film, I put on a couple of times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great expert in martial arts, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, a terrible performance (but that is based on his script). All the characters were not so good. But, some of the things that I like about Rush Hour 2 are always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan does not do those things that are good for him.
