This movie is a bad one, it's a good scam on Friday the 13th. The film is about a murderer named Bernie who kills people around a training camp for field counselors. He kills people because the camp counselor's training camp is on land that was owned by his father, and when the police came to take the land of his father by force, they accidentally killed his mother (another takeoff F13th ). The introduction is to see Bernie killing his first victims. Then, they introduce us to a family that camps in the same forest, shortly after arriving, they are joined by a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later, we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having taken him out of a mental institution. Put Bernie in the family so they can take their things and then the persecution begins. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for those who enjoy B grade 80 Slashers.
