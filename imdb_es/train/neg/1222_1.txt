This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even though the guys deserved some of what they got ... the sadistic and appalling executions were "slightly" exaggerated. The only character that showed some awareness at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could offer some help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be some promise of a mediocre adventure, but this was just a ploy to calm viewers in a false sense of security, before the joy of what was in store for them. come. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the film for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and shouted "and, where's the batman?" Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> That would have been great!
