I wanted to see this movie since it was first announced on television. I went to Tinsel Town to see him last night at 7:40. I regret the day I wasted my ticket on this trash when I could see something better. The beginning was a lot of garbage of sex and clich√©s. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo type. The boyfriend was too stupid for his age. The gases that passed and that the pregnant girl still had barely laughed. The robbery to a bank was completely boring with gags that have been used in other films. His escape car was an old Chevy truck that said he had no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a good girl's vehicle for the robbery? It could have increased the opinion of the audience about the film. This movie was very low, low, low, low, budgeted, since there was nothing damaged or destroyed. This movie had many things that could drive Christians crazy. Hey, I even expected a car chase scene because all the bank robbery movies have car chases but me, but there never was. So I rate this movie b which means low budget and 1 out of ten stars.
