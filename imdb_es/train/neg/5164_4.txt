The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A lady makes him great and returns to his alma mater to be adored. But, in spite of the good performance of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a disaster. The fault of this that I assign Joan Crawford, the director or both, since his performance is simply horrible. Instead of being a real person, he makes a wonderful personification of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares into space and has an expression of "I am very surprised". After a few minutes it really became annoying for me. This is not the only Crawford movie that I do not like for his performance, since he had done more than his overacting, in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or in many of his later films, like BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford movie: there were certainly better ones.
