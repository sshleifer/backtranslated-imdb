This had a great cast with big names like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a group of lesser names but with shorter roles. I also had Technicolor, one of the few films that was made with her in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ... unfortunately, I can not say anything positive about the story. He portrayed the James boys from a totally positive perspective ... and Hollywood has done it ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the "good guys" is beyond me. This film seduces them and converts their enemies, the railroad people, into vicious human beings. The latter was so exaggerated that it was absurd. Well, that's the movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hello Hollywood: here is a breaking news: the Jamess are criminals! Really - look!
