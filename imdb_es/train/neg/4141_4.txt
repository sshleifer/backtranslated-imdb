Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. Like vampires that walk in the sunlight. Although there are parts that simply make you enjoy the way society makes movies. A scene in which a vampire is stabbed and shouts "Oh, this hurts ... it's really stuck." Then it seems that scenes are missing but you get used to it after a while. And there are sequences of random dreams that do not really help with the plot. Now that I think about it, nothing made sense, but I only got a group of friends and I saw it twice to get the full effect. Now that I think about it, the fight scenes were terrible, and the zombies were fun to watch. Slowly as I write more of this I like this movie more. But, you know, in general you can not wait for the Schindlers list, but it's a fun watch.
