LOC could have been a very well made movie about how the Kargil war was fought; I had the locations, the budget and the ability to have been "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down" from India. Instead, it presents itself as a boredom of 4 hours to try to combine the war movement with the masala movie. Even the scenes of war were terribly executed, using the same hill in all its battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time in informal conversations. Instead of trying to attract the Indian public, a better film would have been a direct account of what happened in Kargil (such as "Black Hawk Down") or even spend time in the militant point of view (such as "Tora, Tora, Tora "). Even better, he could have used a competent director such as Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I'd like to see someone reissue this movie, with only the relevant parts included; It would make the movie more visible.
