What fails to make "noise" is to make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer deal with the annoying noises of the city, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie, which has as much creative credibility as "Death Wish." It is smart in the points; particularly a scene in which our hero tries to read through Hagel: "I am too stupid to understand this". He reads and reads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and we do not understand it either. Only then does a car alarm sound. Throughout the film the interference of alarms and noise of the city is constant. Although, in general, it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows all this to ruin his marriage and to be distracted by lateral plots instead of deepening in his person. <br /> <br /> The shooting itself is too foreign to realize its own sound problems, poor quality editing and visible microphones. No, the "noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not fall flat. In general, take home a logistics point, one you probably have not thought of. At least he had not. Although in total, ninety minutes, it could not have ended before. The story went on and it seemed to be lost as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those movies that can be seen at a film festival, but probably will not be picked up for distribution. Watch it on DVD if you are really partial with someone involved in the project. Otherwise omit it.
