This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and it has a dismal story that you've seen a thousand times much better elsewhere. Not to mention that you can see every point of the plot that comes from a mile away. Worst of all, nobody bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that she can not sing. But who cares, she's incredibly good looking. But I'm rambling, nothing new here. In the bottom line, the group of hot girls takes advantage, someone gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a boy, someone goes to hell and then horrible things happen. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe that so many people think that this is a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to rating Black Movies. I do not play that! If you want to support these movies by going to see them, great! If you enjoyed it - super! To each his own. But do not try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I would like people of color not to own this type of film just because they have black actors. Do you want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Thunderbolt. Or The Purple Color. Those would be great movies regardless of the skin color of the actors. Why? Because they told compelling stories with a great performance, that made you feel something long after you left the theater. The fact that it is our experience does not automatically make it a good movie. It's only good, when it's good. Period.
