** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a B movie actor employed during the forties and fifties, runs an expedition to Mars. Before arriving at the Red Planet, we are entertained with a romantic pounding between Mohr and the scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the vision of Les Tremayne as another scientist with a goat's beard. Martian exteriors have false backgrounds and dyes that range from red to pink, the "Cinematic" process that is promoted in advertisements. The real monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, a large Venus Fly-Trap and the unforgettable rat / bat / spider. All the strange adventure is remembered by the survivor Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET, reportedly has many cult followers, and probably picked up most of his followers during the psychedelic sixties.
