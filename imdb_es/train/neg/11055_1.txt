I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and I like to see the few films made about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the main character seemed to me something noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the time he spent struggling for the disabled to be recognized and integrated into the labor market of society in general is excellent. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this movie is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the message that is preaching, so I found it insulting. <br /> <br /> First of all, they did not assign anyone the leading role with a real physical disability. Of course they were competent actors, but it seems totally unpleasant to preach about hiring people with disabilities and then, in reality, NOT HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the movie. In addition, it is complicated by the fact that in a scene in the middle of the film a man is seen walking towards a podium with crutches, which seems to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What? Could not you find a real amputee nowhere for the movie? For a 5-second shot, was it more financially successful to do CGI effects than to hire a REAL amputee? At that moment in the film, I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message I was trying to convey that I came here to complain and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I am. <br /> <br /> Find out that.
