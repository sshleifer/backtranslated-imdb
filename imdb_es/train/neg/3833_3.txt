This movie is a farce, and it is not suitable to be in the company of the superior original. The plot is an absolute disaster, and the movie is too long. Each time they fight, they inject desperately a sentimental reminder of the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the 10 best British films of all time, this is horrible.
