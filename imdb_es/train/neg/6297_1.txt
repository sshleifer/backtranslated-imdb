I am a big fan of Martin Amis, in whose book this movie is based. Unfortunately the director has not been able to translate the book to the screen. The novel is completely postmodern and highly artificial in its exaggerated characters and the disintegration of the traditional plot and the development of the character. It is a hilarious examination of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The director of the film has completely lost the meaning of the novel. In his hands, the film screams at breakneck speed, allowing all the known tricks and the "strange" camera angle possible. It's like Ken Russel in acid, and suffers from the complacency of that senior director up to a hundred. Not even the (brief) glimpse of the magnificent actor Christian Solimeno's penis was enough to save me this miserable movie. Abysmal!
