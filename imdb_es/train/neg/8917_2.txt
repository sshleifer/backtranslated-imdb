The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzsche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe it as insane, include mad doctors to cure it, a couple of somewhat attractive women, their role is played by an actor with a huge mustache, each character speaks with the strongest accent, shows ridiculous dreams, includes another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mentions some words used in the works of genius, exaggerates everything you can, especially music, and voila. Audience, please, stay away.
