While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. Many freedoms were taken when reorganizing events, excluding people and using sets that do not comply with the events of their lives in the 1930s. There was more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go direct long before the shooting, and in fact they went back to crime. Some of the events that were performed in daylight actually took place during the night. Bonnie's wound was much more serious and never healed well. It was so bad that someone had to take her to be cured, and even then she stiffened and walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while he was in prison he cut off a big toe. I know, I'm being very delicate and it was a television movie, but even without these factual errors in this "TRUE" story, the film moves too fast from one event to another and appears more like several separate snapshots of their lives, in instead of being a fluid and cohesive story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
