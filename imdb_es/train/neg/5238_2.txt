I do not understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and unpleasant at all levels and I can not understand how it was done. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound: Sue's dirty, alcoholic, playful Irish father is the best example. None of the characters is sympathetic or remotely, except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend, but even he turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I have no idea why Rita and Sue threw themselves into a consummate threat like Bob, but since they do, why should I expect me to care what happens to them? Many critics continue to insist on how "realistic" it is. If that is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to film it. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
