I thought that watching employment videos about corporate compliance was tedious. This movie did not go anywhere fast. What could have been a somewhat twilight episode of half an hour turned into a seemingly endless loss of film about the people who park their cars, an image of the pool of some kind (you really need to answer your phone by the way) making a matrix printer points his work, and Heuy and Louey, sitting in a yellow-lit control room, repeat "T minus 10 and count" as if something exciting happened. It is not like that, do not make illusions. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something different from the famous personalities of television, and that is stretching to find something good. And do NOT make me start with music that was totally composed of a tympanum, some large marine mammals and comments from microphones. This film is as close as the one I have given to one, but it gets 2 because I could actually finish this cure for insomnia and I did not have to leave in half. Avoid at all costs.
