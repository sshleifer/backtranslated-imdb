I have yet to read a negative professional criticism of this movie. I guess I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an empty bar and are entertained with invented stories. That is the best part. After the three go their separate ways, the film is divided into three threads. That's when boredom begins. Certainly, the thread with the Fellinies babushkas that make dolls with chewed bread is at first a curiosity that opens the eyes. Unfortunately, the director beat this one, even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular. In short: a thin apathy of two hours. If you suffer from insomnia, see him in bed and have a good night's sleep.
