One of the main faults of this film is that, although the mockery of pretentious yuppies is satisfactory, it does not realize that the same movie makers are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be mocked. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. Although the film ignores this feature and, instead, focuses on their dinner misunderstandings, it seems ironic that only the people who enjoy this movie have the same cocky taste in the movies as the characters in their dinner choice. If these pompous characters that were in this movie had a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
