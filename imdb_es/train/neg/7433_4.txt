I have to be completely honest to say first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a full opinion on the movie until I see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from the Finisham maternity hospital. This is where the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works, along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also present, including Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her husband, the future father, Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and Wendy Richard of EastEnders as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan does not work, because all the staff is getting in the way. That is almost everything that can be said about the film until it is seen again in its entirety. Good!
