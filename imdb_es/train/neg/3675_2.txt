Actually, everyone in this movie seems to want to be somewhere else! No wonder, the throw is not done with the left hand, but at all. I have not seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone posing as some kind of agent, carrying a weapon. You do not wear a spoiled-girl look in that role. The only worst thing I can imagine is to see Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is equally horrible, possibly with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did I mention it's a completely crazy story? Endanger the lives of many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German. <br /> <br /> 2/10, because the picture could be worse.
