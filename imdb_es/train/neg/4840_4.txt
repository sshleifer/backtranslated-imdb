This whole movie should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although it was an interesting concept / topic, it did not really develop as a story. Once the initial idea is presented by a bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) Brave (stupid?), And this happens very early in the movie, the rest is repetitive. The characters were not explored and aspects of location and politics were ignored. There was a good idea of ​​the terrible difficulties that the troops faced in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and enemy. But the way the unit operated stretched the belief! The individual performances were good and the special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content.
