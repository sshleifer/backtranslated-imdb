The only reason I chose to give this movie a chance was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever filmed. From what I could see, Borgnine was the ONLY actor. The other performances were so terribly terrible, I'm surprised that a studio paid the "artists" to appear. Combine this level of talent in the acting department with a story so complacent and insipid that I thought my eyes would start to bleed at the time the credits came out, and it has a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously, the film was made to appeal to a children's audience, and to their credit, it was better than most of the original programming on Disney Channel and similar networks focused on children. But honestly, that's not saying much.
