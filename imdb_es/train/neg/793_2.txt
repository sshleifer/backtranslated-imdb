I was not sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad that it was really fun. I'm not a fan of Gackt in any way, although he has talent, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing a hairball. Although I always thought that Hyde had talent, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the subject here, friends. This movie is ridiculous. It is so exaggerated and absurd that it is almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no plot here, except that it's just about vampires with mafioso friends. In a way, this movie almost reminds me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not having enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were ridiculous. Edited quickly, almost difficult to understand, with a choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very elegant during the action scenes, but that is the only redemption of this movie. I'm a jerk for good action movies, but the action was horrible. Although the final shooting was fine and the highlight of this film, otherwise depressing. <br /> <br /> Keep jumping between genres, it's not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, an action movie, a horror or a romance ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this revision is driving you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not kid yourself, this movie is bad.
