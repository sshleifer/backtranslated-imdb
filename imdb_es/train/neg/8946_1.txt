I think the shooting and lighting were very poor. When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really discovered the true year of the film, I was surprised. I did not know there could be such a bad movie made so recently. That is really all I wanted to say. However, this movie had a good plot, nothing you can not miss if you would just read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. Everything I really want to say has already been said, except for this: I can not believe that this film has received so many awards and nominations. I gave this movie a One (horrible) because I felt it was very badly done. Well that's it. Bye
