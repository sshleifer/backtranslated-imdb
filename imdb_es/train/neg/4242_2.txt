Men, I love police movies full of action, shooting, chases, and so on. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed after seeing this short and unsatisfactory movie. We have seen everything before, the hostages, the bank, the surroundings ... However, two bad guys who shoot down several officers and innocent people who simply remain in the line of fire, without being hit due to some Kevlar. <br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Returning to the bank, where the silly hostages did not close the safe or the doors when the bad guys left. How stupid the director thought we would be. <br /> <br /> Well, the shots between that fake documentary were good, but after watching the movie I just thought: why did not the police do it? A decent shooting course? And why were there so many cops and SWAT in a long, real break? Really bad.
