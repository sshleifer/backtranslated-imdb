The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pygmies and takes them to Scotland to later realize that they are not animals or subhumans, but that they are equal to him. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film: two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals and who, nevertheless, have a stereotyped role so superficial within the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the movie. movie because he manages to relate to the pygmies ... There is no idea of ​​how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their terrible experience ... It seems to me that it is a superficial film, with a fundamentally unilateral vision racist ... never manages to get away from the sight of the 'white man'
