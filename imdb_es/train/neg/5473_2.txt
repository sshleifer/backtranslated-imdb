I had never seen one of these original SciFi, this was the first. I think it's fair to judge the acting, direction / production, stage design and even the CGI effects in the other SciFi movies. Compare it with your typical Hollywood production is unfair. However, I will say that, in general, the Aztec Rex does not remember exactly the masterpiece of Werner Herzog, Aguirre, Ira de Dios. <br /> <br /> I will begin by observing that yes, I recognize the fact that this film has more to do with cultural shock than with dinosaurs. Although it is a science fiction film made for television, there is an underlying context in the story that I will examine. The included symbolic elements are quite evident. <br /> <br /> Consequently, as a student of history, theology, mythology and cinema: the outrageous dialogue and the themes of the plot are somewhat insulting. I'm not asking for any mea culpa on behalf of the producers, as I said before the movie is what it is. But what worries me is that a lot of the younger demographics for this movie probably rely on television to give them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem manifests itself in a more visible way with the character. Ayacoatl (not a comment on Dichen Lachman's performance, but simply the way his character was written, though, I'll say he has a lot of work to do before he gets Emmy's nod). It is through its character that the actions of Spanish Europeans are justified. His role in the film as the love interest of Rios affirms that the European way is the right one, simply because they are European. There is really no other reason given. Actually, it can only be assumed that the spectator must associate with the Europeans over the Aztecs because their dress, language, ideology, etc. It is more familiar to them than the Aztecs, so the Aztecs are portrayed as adversaries and vice versa. . And it is not simply that the spectator remains with that assumption due to the ethnocentric perception on the part of the spectators, but that it really seems that the story is trying to convince the spectator: as if the Aztecs were not capable of drawing up a plan, it is not better: to attract a dinosaur until its death in a bed of punji sticks. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there is a subgroup of Spaniards who are portrayed as looting temples and simply try to abuse the natives. Mesoamerican There is also a scene in which we have the Christian holy man who points out the achievements of the Aztecs: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - But in the end, it is still the Aztec warrior who presents himself as the main antagonist of the film, even about the "thunder lizards" (more on this later). He is portrayed as a traitor, duplicator and tries to dispatch the European European romantic by tricking him into consuming mushrooms that alter the hallucinogenic mind, an important spiritual component for certain aspects and religions of the Meso and North American natives (again, more on this later) . that can keep the woman who feels that she belongs to her and away from Spanish. <br /> <br /> Now, by analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving the obvious themes of Christians against the pagans off the table) from a symbolic point of view, a spectator can easily take these so-called lizards of the thunder as representatives of the Mesoamerican ideology / theology, which in this film is described as an attempt: blood thirst, ruthless, cruel, evil, maybe even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian vagabonds, led by a young Hernando Cortes who appears as innocent, but in general nobles, lambs trapped in the dark pagan world of the Aztecs. In addition, the name of the film is Aztec Rex, which leads to believe that it is dinosaurs that eat people. However, what translates into Aztec Rex is Aztec King, a head of the Aztec state, or in this case "state of being". (Hence, why the title of the movie was changed). So, who do we see at the end as the new Aztec king? It's the remaining Spanish, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to the new European ideology that won, through disease, bloodshed, war and hunger, the Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the European ideal, as the presenters of this film would like to be remembered (in opposition to Cortés, who represents the "practical European but still noble"). But when we examine the Holocausts of the Americas, let's be honest: do not the symbolic components of the history of this film have it the other way around? <br /> <br /> I have to say that Aztec Rex is, in the worst case, a bit racist, or to be nice, ignorant at best. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, Everything is meant to be fun, I understand, but in the end, do we have the idea that Ríos was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what the Mesoamerican natives would have to think about this ending ... as for me, I thought it was a little too self-indulgent. <br /> <br /> The best supporting presentation of the movie is due to Ian Ziering's wig, although conspicuous: at least it altered Ziering's appearance enough that he did not think he was seeing the yuppie of the 90210 leading a group of conquerors to the heart of darkness. Ziering actually proves to be a more than capable actor in this movie, I really bought his acting, or at least forgot that it was Ian Ziering anyway. I do not know who your agent is, but you should get more work. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I've been a fan since his very brief scene stealing performance in 1988's Scrooged. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
