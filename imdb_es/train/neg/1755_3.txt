This film is not without charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately, this effort is too vain and too focused on potential customers. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time, but she takes a lot of attention from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overload of the script with clichés The daughter who secretly leaves the university, an older woman who has difficulties getting a good job (and first ends with a rather demeaning job), the executive of the network of poor quality with its executive toys that opt ​​for the ostentation of the substance, the journalist who sticks in favor of their beliefs, etc. There is nothing really bad about any of these, that is, they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are too much and leave us with too many deja-vu and very few surprises.
