Of all the movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth something to you), this is the worst movie I've seen. I know there are probably some worse I have not seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She has not been accredited! His role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the cover? IMDb does not even list it in his filmography. This movie was so bad that we wrote a little note in the video store when we returned it and put it inside the case. I read something like "please save your future customers from having to see this movie completely and totally bad!"
