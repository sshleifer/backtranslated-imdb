This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad state of our cinema when a non-professional garbage like this is considered "worthy of an Oscar". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here the spectator is stagnant and the power rests on the actor's presentation and, most importantly, on the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good scriptwriter because he knows better the forms of words. The best playwrights know how to create images that the sterile stage can not show. <br /> <br /> The second level is the movie. In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one place all the time. With the film, the context can take on the qualities of visual poetry and meaning, in addition to strong writing. In addition, the film can manipulate everyday elements such as sound and color in an almost surreal way. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated into paper and then reimagined by the reader. Many more details can be included in a novel than is conceivable for a film studio. <br /> <br /> This is the reason why adaptations can go up, but never go down. The novelizations are never better than the base movie (see the tens per dozen at your local bookstore), while the film can not convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Movies can rarely be converted into reproductions and reproductions can always be converted into movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails. It's a movie that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to film something well. The characters speak the same thing and act in the same way, it's pure futility. Add to that an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a movie that you can not see. <br /> <br /> I saw him in my high school drama class with 20 other aspiring musicians. The instructor commented on how sad the movie was. What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. If this had been in color, the scenes of impotence, the party in the pool and the old prostitute would be considered a great comedy. Look at what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT the movie instead of trying to teach WITH the movie. Two visually powerful downbeat movies: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not this. It's the 'Last' that I want to see. 1 out of 5
