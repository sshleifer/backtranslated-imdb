Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. The films before that tried to take advantage of the festive spirit, especially "Santa conquers the Martians", at least it was entertaining to see him because of his camper character, and all the footage used ... for some reason, That seemed happy to me But this movie just screws Christmas in the back and screws the joy of all the children. Does Santa live in space? Your enemy is a demon called Pitch? Does Santa get help from Merlin the Magician? How random is this? Well, since it was made in Mexico, then some of you could understand how the movie was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were extravagant at the moment. It was a cluster of madness! Although, despite all the problems with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good conquers evil, and Christmas still represents a part of our hearts of all the good girls or boys of the world, or possibly of the universe, thanks to Santa Claus conquering the Martians ... apparently. So, I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... although I should put a smile on your face any day.
