Save the $ 8.97 you will spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and watch the real Steven Spielberg movie. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and, as I am an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took me four days to finish seeing this because I could not stand seeing more than 10 minutes at a time. It is awful. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell was it? Did you use most to buy a new house? Financing your retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is really good about this movie. He stays true to the book And there are some good performances in him. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good movie. But the good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible ... and I mean horrible special effects. Any first-year student at the film school could have done a much better job with the CGI. For me, most of them looked like "stop action" card clippings that were used instead of the sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project should use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post-production that was applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and in one day we had five scene minutes that looked better and more realistic than those created by Hines. I've seen that movies with budgets of less than $ 2 million look better. Better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than the special effects of Hines in this movie. In fact, I have much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse with today's technology for a movie to look like a 50's B-Movie unless that was the intention, which should not have been with this particular project. <br /> <br /> One problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the movie is uneven, another amateur film demonstration. <br /> <br /> In general, I must say that in 2003 I produced a $ 45,000 project that has better cinematography and special effects than this movie. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend to anyone who appreciates good moviemaking or who is a WOTW fan to leave this movie on the shelf and see the 50-foot Women's Attack instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
