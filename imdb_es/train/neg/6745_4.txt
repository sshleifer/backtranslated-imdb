This is a low budget "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new worker in a notoriously anonymous office, where she finds herself and begins a relationship with her co-worker "Chris". During a party in a jacuzzi, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to a "Murder Club" where everyone has killed someone for fun. When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, the thoughts follow one another. <br /> <br /> The movie looks good, and there are requirements for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe some slightly larger star cameos). that the cast), but, after the list of credits, you'll wonder why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.
