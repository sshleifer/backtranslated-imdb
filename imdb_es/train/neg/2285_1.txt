Well, that's 90 minutes of my life, I will not go back. This movie makes the television show for teenagers "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The acting was horrible and the plot unrealistic. I do not even mean the current band that is at the forefront of this story, boring songs, appearance, etc. You had to believe that they were one of the most popular bands in the country, and there is not enough irony on the subject. world to accept that one. It is considered that the guitarist is a heroine user, not that he blames him, if he were in such a rotten band with obsolete songs and wooden performances, he would also be injecting the horse. <br /> <br /> If you take Music remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.
