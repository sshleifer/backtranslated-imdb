Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have escaped from college. When the creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he blackmails them to help him score with the beautiful and courageous student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> "Stupid and incompetent comedy" - much more growling - Induce to induce laughter. The film tries to attract its target audience with its disgusting gags, but NONE OF THEM WORK. What's more, it's full of useless and unattractive characters, and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that it's a big change. The film even tries to use the actress / actress of the 60s and 60s, Mamie Van Doren, in the most scandalous scene of the film. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> What reduces it most is its absolute predictability and the waste (once again) of the talent of veteran comic actor Joe Flaherty: when will this guy stop accepting every role that comes along and will do something? Worth it? <br /> <br /> In general, the only thing I liked was James (also known as Jaime) King, who was very attractive and deserved better. <br /> <br /> This does not get more than one in ten from me.
