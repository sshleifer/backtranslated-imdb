Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see it, of course refers to the famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its part. <br /> <br /> Therefore, all three aspects of the title are covered in this film. There is a lot of drugs on the scene, and there is also a pale, dark-haired girl, with a prince who has to go through all sorts of problems to come to his rescue. <br /> <br /> But: it's not a fairy tale. It is supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Motto). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is close to perfect. Unfortunately, a weak plot, predictable dialogues, a mostly unreal scenario and mixed performance do not add up to create authenticity. Thus, as a spectator, I remained intact. <br /> <br /> And then there were the clich√©s, which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter of the upper class; Of course, her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. His best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steel worker and a housewife) live in a small, poor and happy apartment, and ignorant of the desperate situation in which their daughter is. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) From the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered the economically less successful but emotionally more fit in the country). He has problems with his parents. They are immigrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept their wild way of life, until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so it is. in: Naturally, the drug trafficker is brutal, the bankers have no heart, the owner of the club is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), only has in mind his career when he exposes Snow White in artistic pornographic photographs in a show . <br /> <br /> This revision does not need a spoiler to allow you to add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other films by Samir, for example. "Forget about Baghdad", I was quite disappointed. Let's wait for the next one.
