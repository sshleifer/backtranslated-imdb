I'm a big fan of Stooges, but the only redeeming quality that this film has is that Curley is in it. Done long before he starts drinking a lot, it's his classic self in this (and Larry is not bad either). The character of Moe is a direct part (mostly) and this movie would be better called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the Stooges films were very good (in my opinion), but as commented by a commentator here, it is very sad that this film has real potential. The casting was good, it was well directed, filmed and edited, but the story line tried to be something serious with just some antics of Stooges and musical numbers (which I think were good at the time) included. The best you can do for yourself during this movie if you really think it should be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash (which is subject to debate) is to wait for the Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it.
