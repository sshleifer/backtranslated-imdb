This movie is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". Why? Because the only positive thing about this was the good laugh I got before the absolute absurdity of the absurd, absurd plot and the horrible performance. Wow! <br /> <br /> Within this movie there are many unanswered questions ... for example; Why these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are "caretakers" of zombies and what is their purpose? Since when 6 people make up a "nation" of zombies? And the smeared black eye mask is "terrifying" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old boy? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this movie made at all? Why? why? why? Unanswered? That's what I thought. <br /> <br /> On the demand channel, they actually made this comment after the synopsis of the movie: We apologize for this movie in advance "LOL, at least they had the decency to do this so much!
