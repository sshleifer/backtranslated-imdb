I enjoy watching movies from the west, but this movie takes the cookie. The script and the dialogue is laughable. The performance was horrible, where did they get them? The music was good, I have to say. Luckily I did not buy or rent the movie, but now it's discarded. <br /> <br /> I was ready at the beginning when the stranger (Martin Brillo) started telling his story. I must admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong took the finger from Tex and told him to practice for 40 years to get to his league. But that's where everything went pear-shaped from then on. I had to watch the whole movie with the hope that it would improve, I never did.
