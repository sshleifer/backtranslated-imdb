In my opinion, this movie does not advance any new thinking. It seems to me that carrying a spear to a spear without looking to one side! The director seems to have an agenda! Duh! It seems to me that their rationality does not exist, there does not seem to be room for alternative vision. I, in general, I am on the side of opposites, but this film lacks credibility, since it is based on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street. really now, if you want to create a credible alternative to a creed held for more than 2000 years, you must make a greater effort for the other party to express your beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film I felt like an attack on Cristian's faith, for my part I'm not a believer, but I allow the beliefs of others, and I would not want to ridicule them but try to understand and understand. tolerate.
