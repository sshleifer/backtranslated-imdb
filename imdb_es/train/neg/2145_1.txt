I have a question for those who thought of this idea. Why? What made them think to make a second movie of this. If memory does not work, did not Cinderella end with "Everyone lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure he did it, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if everyone lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there could not be a sequel. I mean for sure, they could make Cinderella sing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A film that ends in "happily ever after" can not have a sequel; If he does, then they do not live happily ever after! Something has to go wrong, which causes problems with the first end! Why? That's not right, it's evil. That is my last word on this.
