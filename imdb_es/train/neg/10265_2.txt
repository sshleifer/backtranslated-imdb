Kirstie Alley, who seems a bit thinner, but just a little, is in this mess with a man who looks like MacGuyver, has bleached blond hair and all. The premise of the film is about an older woman (50 years old) who can not produce her script due to age discrimination, so she sends her youngest nephew to pass himself off as a writer. It is not an original idea or a very good movie with bad acting, inane dialogues and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot related to a writer in love or admired by the character of Kirstie and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who plays Kirstie's brother is so awkward and wooden that it was torture to watch his scenes. What is there to say about this movie? Avoid it
