It's not as bad as some do, although obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh; try not to compare it with Gabbar in the original because they clearly did not go for the same effect. However, apart from some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the movie is flawed. The development of the character was deficient and the development of the story was useless, with many gaps and missing information that I would not know if I had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie were the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and especially this new guy named Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoyed from the moment her lips opened for the first time. As for Prashant Raj, seriously who is this guy? Where is it from and why the hell was he present in the movie studio for more than just serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and has the same tone, dialogue and unwavering expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene in which someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed, which is more than I can say for his mistake of a partner. In general, it is worth observing the RGV Aag for the solid performance of Amitabh, and also a very sexy Urondilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
