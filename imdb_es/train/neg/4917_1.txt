**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take an important novel to list all the comedy routines in it. During the glory days of her show, Carol Burnett and company, who often took off in movies, skewed it in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the music came up and everyone looked around wondering where she was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with padlocks and he almost looks like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing more fun than this bit is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene at the end. Jenny really seems to be dying well ... dying for her makeup artist to come and give her a little color. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to sleep with them during the patient's final moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the film business is an instant classic. He had a lot to worry about. He never recovered from this.
