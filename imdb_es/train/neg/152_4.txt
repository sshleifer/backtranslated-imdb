You may consider that a couple of facts in the discussion are spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win an Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right about that. vote. (Other Oscar nominations for best actor and the like ... that I do not know, but it would be difficult to justify, given what they were told to do and what they see in the final product). The way Spielberg directs him is so artificial, so intrusive. While watching this film, a distinction that was made during a Film as Art course that I took shouted: "The feeling is an honest emotion that is transmitted honestly .. The sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false vision of life". This is exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life do two people begin to read aloud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when they are sitting in bed reviewing the Nettie letters they have found? There are examples of this kind of false behavior throughout the film: all the men crowd around Miss Millie's car and then jump in unison like a flock of birds that take off when she leaves to leave; Harpo falling through the roofs of several buildings he is working on (a cheap gag); the whole troop of revelers who are heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if they were magically enchanted by the chorus singing ... again and again. Nothing sounds true. I even wondered if the name of Harpo was chosen on purpose because it is the true name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah", the other way around. Spielberg is not above that "tenderness". <br /> <br /> It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly representing action and emotion. Schindler's list was astounding, deeply moving to me, and I also admire Saving Private Ryan for its realism, even if the story is a bit artificial.
