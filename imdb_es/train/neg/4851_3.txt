See a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq tell their time before they can go home. <br /> <br /> That in itself sounds boring. Every time that little legend came out that told us how long they had gone, it only caused this film without a plot to continue over and over again. Hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I must be missing something. I'm a big fan of war movies if they're well made. This had the "jarhead" syndrome. A film that is sometimes filmed beautifully, but cinematography does not prevent it from being totally boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And overcome the slow motion of "cartridges that come out of the gun" already filmed. They could have saved money and obtained archival images of any other movie with a weapon. <br /> <br /> I did not feel any empathy for the main guy, I always hoped that his imprudence would make him die. In fact, the movie would have worked much better if it had. <br /> <br /> I read some criticisms and seemed to have the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces did not like it, and everyone else loved it. I have never been in the forces, and I am with them. It is pretentious nonsense. The 3 stars are for cinematography.
