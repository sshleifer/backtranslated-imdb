Helen has many problems and none of them is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play the mothers of a couple of Leopold & Loeb as assassins who move from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, an aspiring star of Jean Harlow, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is his pianist. Soon Winters (as Helen) begins to laugh. Everything is very slow and, although there are moments of real chills (unpleasant phone calls, a visit from wino Timothy Carey), the film lacks real horror. However, it is still worthy of entertainment. The divas that act are fine and the production values ​​are excellent. A musical score by David Raskin, the cinematography of Lucien Ballard and the Oscar-nominated costumes contribute enormously. With this, A PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA in his honor, does someone make madness as well as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a teacher in this type of exploitation not quite A-movie. In addition to Carey, the supporting cast includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as very Aimee Semple McPherson as an evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (the Irishman Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, appropriately nicknamed Hammy.
