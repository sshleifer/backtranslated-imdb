First, let me start this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do not read books, I do not play, I do not wear underwear or cereal (if there is one). I'm just a movie fan. <br /> <br /> That said, I find it hard to see how people are giving so much praise to this movie. Taking this film for itself, and not comparing it with its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how it can be said that this is an incredible movie. For all the terrible deficiencies in the script: cheesy dialogue, devised scenes (that is, R2 is suddenly a badass, and intense CGI chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE performance and noticed holes in the plot ... How is this good? ? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; It seemed that a switch had been activated and, suddenly, it became evil. I was not interested in the film until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the Frankenstein scene "NOOOOOO!"). When BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious phrases when they could and should have been more, this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much lightness in the speech of ALL the characters. <br /> <br /> I conclude with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really? A sense of urgency and importance for what was really going to happen?
