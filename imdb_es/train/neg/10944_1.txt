Now, I have seen many bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including the one in which he is his own clone, the two in which he plays twins, and the three in which he is a cyborg. In fact, I'm the owner of the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if there's nothing else, you have a big butt and you can almost always see it.) With the DVD, you can even pause and get close!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. The tricks are bad. The effects are bad. The performance is spectacular, the terrestrial life is quite bad, very probably showing the worst performance of each actor of the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that is really something. And I would be willing to bet that everyone involved in this movie is wrong in bed to begin with. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> He manages to be involuntarily fun, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or very, very drugged. I myself could sit down because I needed to see something to distract myself from rinsing the cat's urine from my clothes. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a gay incendiary.
