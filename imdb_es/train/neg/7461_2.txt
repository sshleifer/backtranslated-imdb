*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From its first opening credits, this fantastic movie makes things clear: it's an instant classic. It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". The mere greatness left me speechless when I left the cinema and went directly to the ticket counter to buy another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires multiple presentations. The first observation will surely leave you with that strange 'Eh?' feeling, but do not feel embarrassed, it happens to the best. History is so devilishly intelligent that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot who infiltrates the FBI, turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the structure of the plot will disconcert you in your first visualization, but do not give up! It was not until my sixth or seventh presentation that I only started to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of 'Corky Romano'. And watch out for the unexpected twist at the end, otherwise, you might be caught off guard when it is discovered that FBI agent, Brick Davis, is the FBI's most wanted criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out as a homosexual. Surprised, I can tell you that. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedic talent is incomparable as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Reminiscent of John Reynolds 'performance in `Hands, The Hands of Fate', Kattan acquires innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all the scenes with perfect comic timing. However, Kattan is not just comedy. He is also a master of drama, since he controls the feelings of the audience with the smallest movements of his face. Their facial expressions reflect life itself, in a certain way. For example, in the scene in which he faces the faces of his brothers, one can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected in his anguished face. At a time like this, it's hard to find a dry eye in the house. <br /> <br /> Writers David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of 'Corky Romano'. With a history of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project. His skillful storytelling and unorthodox structure make 'Pulp Fiction' look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live drama. The story of Garret and Ward is so compelling and attractive that it grabs you by the hair, swallows you up, shakes you and spits you out. At the end of the experience outside this world known as "Corky Romano", you will find a different person with different world views and different ideas, and with only one question in your mind: <br /> <br /> Why God God, why?!?
