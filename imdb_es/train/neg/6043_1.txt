You should be watching my comments on many movies under Evren Buyruk. I'm going to make another comment about a movie that is not worth a minute of conversation. However, this film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself, almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough clues or knowledge of characters to be surprised. It was just a sad and sad loss of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie just sucked. Slow does not make the movie bad, it was just bad. The incomplete plot mixed with artistic divergences of anamorphic details do not unite in a cohesive way in a meaningful way for a plot, except to highlight some bloods that are illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again, which was even more disappointing). In general, I do not like to make negative or critical comments about the works of others, even when they stink, but this movie justifies it. . It is a pity that these great actors were ashamed with this final result.
