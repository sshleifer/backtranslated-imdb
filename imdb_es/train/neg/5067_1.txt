It is quite simple. Friends is a very basic comedy comedy aimed at teenagers and young adults, with a little sophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is also painfully obvious that, towards the end, they desperately tried to last 10 seasons. very likely to be able to say that they beat Season 9 of Seinfeld. The problem with this is that Seinfeld had 9 incredible seasons with great writing, Friends (and I'm being very generous here) in 5 or 6 seasons OK and then in 4 abysmal seasons. <br /> <br /> It became a telenovela with recycled humor and recycled character traits that were not so good, so it starts and will get worse by the hundredth time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so high. It is really horrible.
