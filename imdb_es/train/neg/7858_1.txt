I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for this kind of "horror" movies, but at least they should hire some suitable actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monotone to flatten every line he has. But let's be honest, the lines are not really important. There really is no recognizable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and another variety of bad words instead of a appropriate dialogue. <br /> <br /> The "story" as it is, consists mainly of seemingly random blood and death, with a couple of "surprises" worthy of circumvention, which happen about 10 minutes after seeing exactly what is going to happen. occur. Not only this, but there are several plot holes and continuity errors (why do they get in there? Did not have a weapon? Was not it dead?), So the whole movie seems as if it had been reducing the several hours that It would take to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another film that simply relies on blood and blood instead of any real cinematic experience.
