I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ... however, the first problem was that there really was not a story ... or actually there was a story but it was not It made no sense at all. The second problem was that there was no configuration for these characters ... yes, I understood that everyone went to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the film, they realized that they had nothing in common and did not they liked ... then, why did they keep coming together? The number 3 fault ... the director despite the long pauses and tight shots of the camera was equivalent to suspense (especially with the typical bent suspense music) ... I was sadly wrong. It was painful to see an excellent actress like Amber Benson waste her time trying to bring this one back to life ... my only hope is that the money she made here will go to the production of her own movie.
