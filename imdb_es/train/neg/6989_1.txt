<br /> <br /> The worst. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (apart from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the film's soundtrack)? Zombies that * run * ??? I suppose the director never saw the original "Dead" movies, which show creatures of rigid limbs (de rigor mortis) dragging their feet towards their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how, exactly, did the survivors know what the ship in the marina belonged to the recently deceased Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
