I just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A group of children, from 14 to 22 years old, put the DVD of "Titanic" in a fantastic entertainment offer for the home with a mega-screen of last generation. Only two of them had seen it before. But everyone had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic began, they began to worry, some of them asked the others: "Call us when the iceberg appears". After an hour and a half of the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, all returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with their mouths open, emitting Ohs and away. So, how I thought when the movie first appeared on the scene. What is this? An hour and a half waiting for the damn thing to sink, but what about the rest? Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar execution time, but think about how much happens in that movie within the same time period. In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the cream of the cream, supposedly, in the boat's first class dining room. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The story is so thin that they have to put guns and guns into a ship that is about to sink. The real collapse here is the cinematographic standards. All efforts focus on special effects and opening weekends. The movie became the highest grossing film of all time, so, what do I know?
