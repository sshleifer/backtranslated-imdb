This movie is even a big step down from the typical rate offered by Bollywood. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, becomes completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And despite striving, female leaders fail to be "sexy." Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck at a similar rate for the time being. But this monstrosity is even below its limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in badly written cliche papers. It is time for Indra Kumar to hang his director's hat. I hope he never directs another monstrosity like this. The future of Hindi films is in better hands now. To summarize, stay away from celluloid waste.
