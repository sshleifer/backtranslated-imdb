Obviously, many behind-the-scenes team members worked on this film, so do not even look at the credits at the end, you'll only see them against them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; Two fainted after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and they rejected the designs of the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the film obviously did not want to outshine the monsters of the third category film, so they hired first-rate actors who apparently could not memorize their lines, or in some cases learned to pronounce the words before the beginning of the movie. filming. Some scenes are incredibly inept to convey what is supposed to be happening, if anything happens. If you have the bad luck of being in a theater where this movie is shown, and do not faint, you will laugh at what are supposed to be the horrific or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will simply stun him, and the fact that Stephen Dorff regularly vomits 'Queen Mary of the curses' conveys the feeling of anyone paying to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it is in the trash can in the video store. If there is some justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it.
