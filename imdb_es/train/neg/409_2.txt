<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this one. It became a joke about himself. Once again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, women who look bad and many talks of attention between the characters and the dollying trays. <br /> <br /> Everything is for nothing. Because there is no action at all in this movie. Fudges all your fixed pieces. All actors give the kind of performances of a Verhoeven movie. In other words, unbridled by acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world in which the characters lived. In this the scientists are acting in the same way. Sorry Paul, but the soldiers and the scientist do not really have the same mentality. <br /> <br /> A major flaw in the plot was that after escaping that night to do bad things, the character of Kevin Bacons returns to science. Lab where we have already spent more time watching these animated maniquens (with the exception of Elizabeth Shue) walking and talking. Why not show the scope of what the character could do in the outside world? How could they track it if it could be anywhere? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. Then look at what this film does and you will really know how poorly and conscientiously the whole project really was. <br /> <br /> More insulting is the Doco on the DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd genius. Well, one in two is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing remarkable about it. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
