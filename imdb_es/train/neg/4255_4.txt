The film begins with a beautiful lady in a tattered white dress that runs through a stereotypical city in Eastern Europe. We know that he is being followed by something, because he keeps looking back. and soon we see that she is being chased by a mysterious man in a black raincoat. then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is behind her. But look is that your reflection in the showcase of the store? It's not just your identical twin vampire! but unfortunately both understand it. <br /> <br /> after this brilliant and surprisingly funny return to the old films of the 60s and 70s (in the credits, the twins appear as the twins of evil, which of course is the name of the final delivery) in the karnstein trilogy of the hammer), the plot practically dies. <br /> <br /> The small plot that exists there involves Dracula (who changes his appearance conveniently every time he is reborn, so the producer does not). You do not have to rehire the same dr√°cula that comes to a morgue, the medical students realize that it is not dead and they think ... wow, what a chance, maybe I just ignore all those movies that say that I drink blood from Vampire turns you into a vampire and uses the blood of the vampire to find a cure for the illness of our imbecile friend. Obviously, this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but very badly done. The film continues to create wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students try to bring the drac's life back by placing him in a bathtub full of blood in a remote and isolated country. palace. The house itself is terrifying enough to be the center of the movie, but do we stay there? No, because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with the "tributes", as I mentioned before the opening scene is not over, and this scene of the house would have been perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the film quickly changes the subject and It changes to a medical horror. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they introduce so many characters that it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are the medical students and their "friend" type wheelchair teacher. All medical students are: arrogant, bored, hungry for money and stupid. I was surprised at how they came to medical school, unless medical school had to meet their quota of hunk / big breast with muscle limit. And then there's the vampire hunter who remains mysterious throughout the movie. Hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not set it up like the movie about him would. then you have priests, policemen and random types of science. Many people show up and then forget quickly until they need that person to save the day or jump for a scare that quickly becomes tedious. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a lazy movie. There is no real fear, just a couple of foreseeable steps. The configuration of these is so elaborate that it is very funny. For example, the bathtub full of blood. it is so obvious that the drac will come out of the murky blood. and yet, we have to wait too long to reach the inevitable jump scare. after this he kills one of the most stupid and big medicine students. We all know that she will become one of the undead. But what do others do? Bury her in a shallow grave near the house. I sigh, to know who will leave when the cops show up at the house .......... <br /> <br /> Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will get the clue that it's impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go to the atmosphere, and then we'll end up with a full movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
