Except for the best acting skills of the two protagonists, this movie is really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you really would not realize that production values ​​are low if you did not keep trying to convince them that they had production values ​​to begin with. Even for a fan of the B-movie genre like me, this movie really sucks.
