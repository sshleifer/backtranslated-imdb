There is a big difference between launching an original, intense, on the edge of your seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing as the filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with "Cabin Fever" and have simply acted as such. The film follows five college graduates in a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal, as one after another succumbs to this mysterious disease of rapid action that feeds on meat. It is not long before friends look at each other, and can barely stand their sight, much less want to be in the same neighborhood as them. As disgusting as it sounds, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less arrogant filmmaker. Unfortunately, what we end up with is badly drawn characters whose only purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make more contrasting the inevitable decomposition, a trite script so profane that leaves the viewer tuning the dialogue, and several incomprehensible. subplots that motivate little more than (in one case) an on-screen appearance of director Roth. This is making careless movies in various ways! Avoid this devouring time.
