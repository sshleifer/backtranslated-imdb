It was probably just my DVD, but I would not recommend anyone trying to see this image on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to turn up the volume of my television to the highest possible level, in To listen to about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some of the conversations still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you can have a chance, even if it's slim. <br /> <br /> The Peoples voices were drowned out with almost all the environmental sounds, including unwrapping a packet, steps, even smoking a cigarette. <br /> <br /> With the volume up to a level where you can hear the voices, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes to a noisy environment, like a disco. . And that will be injured diving by the remote control to turn it off. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in times of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour, I gave up, since I had not seen anything else redeem in the image.
