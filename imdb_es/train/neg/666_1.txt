I saw this trailer and I thought that my god is this real movie, who would want to see this movie and at the same time I thought that my girlfriend turned to me and said: "We have to go see this movie". ... however, I said it so I saw it for about 5 minutes and tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap fears, but there were none of those. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen, the director has no influence, he has no perspective, the same shots were used and once again he did not generate suspense. The cast was probably only told to shout, run, run, fall. I would love to see the script since the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying female giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is ... well, there was no plot as it was Basically, I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a serial killer stalker. It is brilliant! hmmm The performance was what you expected in a desperate Australian telenovela, the main character, the dam of the god Blondie, bothered me. his longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time he was facing the camera he was pulling another rude facial expression. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you like movies, do not go see this, and if you like me and do not have a choice, then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggling an iPod or a magazine. I can not believe that this movie was made!
