A long time ago, when X Files was a smart program that made you think. A large part of its appeal was that writers sought folklore and science in search of their ideas, linking the plot to the creepy side of real life. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly cautious of the eighth season when it aired. The program had already provided two perfectly good episodes to retire ("One Son" and "Requiem"), and the seventh season had seen a sharp increase in episodes that swept the barrel in search of ideas that were implausible, implausible, or frankly silly. But I thought, hey, give him the benefit of a doubt, maybe they're giving it back because they have some great ideas. <br /> <br /> "Roadrunners" really was upset. Following "Patience," which at least offered an interesting angle on the folklore of vampires that the show had done well to avoid, the episode sees a strange (parasite) parasite with the power of mind control worshiped by a cult of Christian background . Oh, and they think it's the second coming of Christ, but that's only discovered in the last minutes. Seriously. There is * never * any * attempt to make sense of this, to explain what the slug is, why something happens, or anything. Even in the early years of the program, in fact, * especially * then - you could expect a little more depth, a bit of history, or else, then the opposite, a bit of mystery, some uncertainty about what it was about All this. . <br /> <br /> It's Scully who really kills him. I could stand the stupidity of the premise, but having a character that has been developed for 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a credulous maverick for the simple fact of advancing the plot is strange. You feel like you're seeing a horrific teenage horror, except that it's a woman in her mid-thirties who throws herself into the kind of isolated and spooky community in which she has spent most of a decade discovering the most sinister part of, being overtaken by many stereotyped Hicks or completely indifferent to their own safety. Oh, and by the way, Doggett, the new Mudler, is not around. Scully simply went to the desert to investigate a brutal murder without him. It appears at the end to save the day, I can not even remember why, but other than that, it's not really in that. Again: seriously. <br /> <br /> In short, it feels like a generic script written for another program, or the movie project of someone who has been allowed to push like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, long-running show duration at a time when it was at its most vulnerable. It could have worked in a minor show, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less. But The X-Files had something good going on, and Scully was one of the strongest and idiosyncratic TV characters of the '90s. Decide it will change your personality for the sake of a story you should have done in Star Trek about fifty times or more does not make sense.
