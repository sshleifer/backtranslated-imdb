A horribly useless film and, worse, boring. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most imaginative stereotypes, and is based on a clumsy central concept that is not particularly original or treated in a vaguely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is totally lost in what he supposedly expected to be his response to the Jim Carey Truman Show, and replaces his usual routine of screaming (certainly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well, quite nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is nothing but slightly irritating (that some of the criticisms I've read here are talking about her Oscar nomination being ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does an acceptable job with a very weak that allows nothing beyond establishing that his character was a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because he liked to make people happy. Please. That he ends up falling in love with Ferrell's "character" is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to animate the film with computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired material he has to work with. <Br /> <br /> I had the option of seeing the Prestige for the third time or seeing this. I wish I had opted for The Prestige.
