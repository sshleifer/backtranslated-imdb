1999 will go down in history as the year in which the film critic diverted the general public. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they promoted THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who the hell knows. It is full of self-indulgence and charged with bad acting. I always like to stay and see the credits, but when this was over, I could not leave the cinema fast enough. The majority of the audience that attended the demonstration where he was, felt the same way. The dates discussed with each other and with strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
