Way to go! You have just made a chilling and highly intriguing story of a necrophilic cannibal in a soft and gentle drama. Obviously, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds: Horror or documentary, right? This was not any. It was not close to any detailed fact (in fact, it hardly had substance) It was not really morbid or scary or even trying to be very disturbing (as if you had to try it!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? This is one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers, and we received bad shots, bar-room homosexual rapes and prolonged acts and long flashbacks alone at his old father's house. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) 'the soft side' of j.Dahmer.
