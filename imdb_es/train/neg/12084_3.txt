Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous work <br /> <br /> 2. a director who now has his own ideas and is using <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the design of stage of a popular theatrical production of the work mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. an actor for the main role, who has no idea of ​​the role he is playing. And you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" <br /> <br /> I listened to the radio of "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I were very disappointed. I hoped the filmed version would be better, that Schell had at least one body language to underscore what he's saying, nothing. Then the set ... the minimalist design is not to everyone's taste, but I usually like it when there is enough on stage to clarify what the stage is and nothing more. Oh, that's on a stage, in a theater. It will not work in a movie based on a work that really has a credible configuration. That the idea for the set was copied from the theatrical production in which Schell already played Hamlet ... let's say if that was the only thing he complained about ... I wonder how Schell could get the role of Hamlet anywhere . Place and how someone could allow him to play Hamlet for the second time. If you have the option of watching any of the nearly sixty films based on "Hamlet", do not look at this, unless you're a masochist, or very hard, or you like to make fun of the actors without talent.
