I saw this movie the other night. I can not even begin to express how much this movie was crap. The writing, the acting voice, even the claymation. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching the 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy. It just does not work Literally, it deflates in almost every possible place. <br /> <br /> In addition, the animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know this is a movie made by a single person, but to think that I could do 97 minutes of shit, maybe I could at least do 1 second of fun. <br /> <br /> This program may not last long. Pastel for being the worst movie of all time. Yikes It really was so bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, stay away from this abomination. My advice: do not even buy it, or look for it. Your brain will do it.
