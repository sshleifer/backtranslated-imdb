This movie is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on her skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely strange. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" background. The plot turns an old form of art into a fetishist pornography. In addition, the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong show portraits of bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the center of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the entire film, I still think that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the environment of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverted but boring movie. Seriously stay away from it.
