If you like movies about spooky cities, hotels, houses, states (like the "Hotel California" of Las √Åguilas), etc., that possess people who are "passing by", read almost any novel by Stephen King. If you like the "Disappearance" setting, start by reading King's "Despair," but also check out "The Shining," "Salem's Lot," and "Needful Things." <br /> <br /> The reason for the crow, the desert, The family that drives desperately to escape or avoid possession is tired. Why did not they simply make the movie from the novel "Despair"? Maybe they approached King and he refused? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are happy to meet and have become well over the years, but they are still TV actors and direct caliber to DVD.
