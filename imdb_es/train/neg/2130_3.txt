I guess I'm going to be late for the party. I just watched this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I did not know it existed and I was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I played Albert and I'm thinking of doing an amateur production of the show because I remembered it as a lot of fun to do. I was not impressed with this new version. It just was not fun enough. It was not colorful. He lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. No one seemed to mention this fact. This is not a bad mood musical, it's brilliant and even rhythmic. The decision about lighting was a bad creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I have no idea about that in this version. The lighting was horrible and tarnished the performances in general. The dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos these days. At least the dance numbers should have been measured with some of the best, or some of the best on Broadway. The choreographer was asleep at the wheel, apparently. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors had a supreme talent, there were some really bad casting options. Vanessa Williams is not Latina, and with so many talented Latin artists, it would not have been more correct to choose one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, charming and talented, but bad casting. Jason Alexander's effort was amazing, he always does smart work, but it just was not Albert. It was a mistake and I think that is obvious to most people who see this version. <br /> <br /> The middle of the film is not the middle of the stage. There must be translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the flash of the musical stage must be TRANSLATED to the film. There is no merit in being faithful to a scenario script when filming. The spirit, the essence of production must be manifested. For me, the film production of Bye Bye Birdy in 1963 was bright and animated, while the 1995 production was as grim as the lighting and as dazzling as the dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate loss of effort for many really talented people.
