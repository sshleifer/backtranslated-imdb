It is not worth renting the video or time or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Make-up that a child can do. * The performance is over ... bad direction. * The edition was very choppy ... many things did not make sense or simply seemed free. * The sound was poorly folded. * The music was highly inappropriate. * The casting was extremely off ... it must have been in crack. * Zombies that talk and much less ... drive, dance, work ... it just makes me angry. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! As horribly cast as he was ... he was the most handsome zombie of all. What does not say much. <br /> <br /> The art on the cover was good but very misleading ... just like the DVD's main menu ... excellent illustrations and music. <br /> <br /> DO NOT HAVE ME!
