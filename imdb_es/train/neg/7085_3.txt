I really tried to like this movie. It is an important problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and our hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, perverted, neurotic) endangers their marriage, their work and even their life. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are terrible; Mainly the performance. Oh, you will not enjoy ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are made with very bad taste and you may think that you are watching a movie made at home. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is simply not meaningful. How could such an intelligent and beautiful wife withstand all the unpleasant things of the husband? How could she believe him ?! The situation of the trio is priceless and will make you laugh for a while. <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with the black movie assistant is useless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you'll find in abundance. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; It's not soft-core, it's not a documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. It's a pretentious effort by the so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's legs on display are worth it. I detected it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
