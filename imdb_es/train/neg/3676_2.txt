Susan Swift is an attractive young woman, a flower girl transplanted to the 1980s (as a young Susan Dey), but she does not have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic performance and tends to complain; Still, it's pretty sweet and has bright eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as it was called when it was released briefly to the cinemas), Swift can be the reincarnation of a witch of Salem. The movie is very low budget and borrowed from so many other pictures that I gave it up with 15 minutes to go. It starts strong and has some attraction for the camp. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen about this; However, as the junk movies go, it's not too terrible. The Boston locals are a definite asset, and the cast of support is entertaining. * 1/2 of ****
