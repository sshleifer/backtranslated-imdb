I received this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about it. It had a 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were nice. But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but I never got scared. It starts well, but although it does not bore me at all, the story is so common and the things that happen are so normal that I did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can make some laughs. . And you can see some small tits. But if you like the kind of giallos that I like (bizarre murders, surreal, meaningless, bloody, atmospheric, brutal ...) you will not appreciate this movie very much. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 for the good direction and editing, and the final turns, which make the film entertaining. But it could be much better.
