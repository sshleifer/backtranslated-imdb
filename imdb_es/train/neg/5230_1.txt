Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are stupid and amateur, and they are not very funny, unless you are a 14 year old with a little developed sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It is certainly not famous, as the immature fanatics would like you to believe, harassing people on Wikipedia, or filling out the ranking votes here on the IMDb. Of course, it has not been described by any major media, which says a lot about its "fame" and its creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has some limited animation ability, but he needs to get away from his youth. Flatterers learn to write real fun material before they take it seriously as a true artist. From this moment, however, he is just a child with a camera, and it shows.
