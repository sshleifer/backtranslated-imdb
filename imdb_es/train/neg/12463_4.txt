OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> I'm obviously lying because it is. I am conservative, but the policy that I am going to leave out of my opinion of the film. This movie was against the bush, against the Middle East, against oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> I will turn off and give credit where the credit is due. I saw this movie premiere night because I like this kind of movies and I am a student of political science in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the performance was, as far as I could tell, very good. <br /> <br /> However, the plot was impossible to decode. I have been tested and I have an IQ of 138, but no matter how much I tried, there was no way I could put together the story of the film and what characters did what. <br /> <br /> The story and the scene The sequence was totally incoherent and badly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be seen many times to get the full depth of the story, which may very well be, I have no idea exactly what was happening. <br /> <br /> What makes sense because if you want to present a political argument and not receive any criticism, make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not dazzle them with brilliance, disconcert them with Bull S.
