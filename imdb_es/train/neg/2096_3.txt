As a fan of just the first 2 seasons of BSG and the independent feature BSG Razor, he hoped that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually, I do not have any problem with science fiction that is mainly based on dialogue instead of a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is set with some original ideas delivered by good actors, you can create a deep movie with little CGI spent money. This prequel does not have any of the aforementioned requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply placed there to raise the casting rating to Restricted. It's not that teenagers do not like virtual reality, there are wells full of sex, violence and heavy music. It's the part of those same teenagers who have the intellectual depth and the reason or the political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that it perplexes me. These children are definitely not from this planet. The film develops like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being a bit interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a divine conscience through updating the student's firmware was fun if not entertaining. But this old concept was much better represented and much more credible in the brilliant and classic "Frankenstein" original with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off her only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! In general, this film was tasteless and unoriginal and cheap looking, using recycled CGI from BSG's Caprica. I doubt he's watching this telenovela when it opens on the science fiction channel. Unless, of course, I am suffering from a bad insomnia attack, at which time this show would definitely be the cure. Zzzzzzzz
