Two films are useful to scare people to God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and moving message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can get. Too bad that Paul Anderson went to the damn Resident Evil movies, he really had something going on. <br /> <br /> Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious attributes of the independent film (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with the Omega Code, Left Behind and the other Tribulation films. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned about selling their message: "Saved, friends!" that everything else becomes the second place to hit the audience in the head with a Bible. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe I'm even writing so much about such an ineffective movie. He jumps completely and returns with Sam Neil taking out his eyeballs. 1 out of 5
