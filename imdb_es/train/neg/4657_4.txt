The remakes (and the sequels) have been a basic element of cinema since the beginning of the media. However, it is more or less a successful adventure. If you take the good from the original and build it and update the key features with current standards, you can succeed. Keep in mind that movies like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) were successful in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably. <br /> <br /> BRIEF ENCUENTRO (1945) is the template for this movie. It's as perfect as it could be on that subject and we rate it as IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Why, it just happened for the two (2) directors involved at the wrong time. TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON portray in a convincing and sensitive way. Neither of them is a conventional star material, but quality actors. For details, see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, what went wrong? To T.V. Movie, remake practically scene by scene with actors named RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least a score of IMDb ****** Six. Although both actors seem disinterested, they simply appear to mark their watches and collect their checks. Neither are they involved with their characters or with each other. Do not think they're in love or when they finally break up, it's a great loss for any of them. That should not be and that is why he fails in his attempt. Sometimes it is better to leave things alone.
