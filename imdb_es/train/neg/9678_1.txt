I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Although visually fascinating (for example, the use of color was absolutely impressive), it was quite boring and disturbing (see father / son incest). <br /> <br /> Also, the music is totally absent, and if you think about those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films), then you can imagine the difference that make. <br /> <br />
