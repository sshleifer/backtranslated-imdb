I'll be honest, the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially the Early Edition). As he usually plays with the good boy, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also attracted me; a hit man (Tony Greco-a.k.a. Chandler) must kill a person at random before life is entrusted to him or, rather, the death of a witness who will testify against someone in "the family". The movies were not as expected. He was sick, he hated the end (if you saw him, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically, it was dirty, and it made little sense. Yes, it was a mafia movie, and yes, the weapons go to BOOM. But there is more to a movie than that. This movie acted as if it did not have time to go into details, just to treat it and understand it. The acting really made up for it, James Belushi was quite funny like "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel look as believable as he could be. She surprised me more. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to "the family." If only the script did justice to the actors.
