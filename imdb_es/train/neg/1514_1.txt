I just watched this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see her only by Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I lost my time and my money and I told my girlfriend that it was the last time. It's time for us to go see a movie just because a certain actor / actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. From me, as I had paid, I wanted to see the end at least, just hoping that something good would appear, but I did not hold my breath, and luckily, because I would have been a victim of the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it is a black and white film. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all the sex offenders are portrayed as hardcore criminals and the bad guys among them were really very, very bad. Talk about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical phobia of the USA. UU <br /> <br /> The performance of Richard Gere was good as always, but the blonde girl who is supposed to replace him would be, at best, crazy. Totally unconvincing for work. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it an economic, dramatic and sensational turn that is simply unreal. They only use sex offenders as an excuse to enjoy violent and cheap acts of murder, beatings of vigilantes, rapes and torture, something that almost seems gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking people in the movie: how low it can get. <br /> <br /> I suppose the movie will not be released in the US UU And it will go directly to the DVD. That's where I should have stayed in other countries too, but because they are Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a series B movie.
