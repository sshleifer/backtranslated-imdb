The story goes like this: Netflix delayed sending me my DVDs, so I went to the analog rental place known as "Blockbuster Video". Really bad, they have 150 copies of the latest small-time movies for their visual pleasure, but I never want to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all because of his loneliness. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I'll never understand, therefore, I want to see that kind of thing. Anyway, I put this DVD and suddenly, from the first second, it stinks. I'm sitting there with my b.f. and we're like, "what is this kind of garbage?" Unstable operation of the camera, horrible action, the first scene in which a woman dies you wonder if you would prefer to just chat quietly, then a rat gets in the throat. I really wonder if the director has problems with this shit. There's nothing decent in this "movie." All I have to say to the director is "do you have a tripod?" Each shot was brutally unstable. The music was horrible. It was as if they had decided one day to make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to introduce themselves and "act" for them. Just horrible If you make a movie like this, then directing is your hobby (NOT what you should do to live). You should not get to the renal exits of DVD for fans of movies like me. It is better that you leave them at home for your friends when you have a party and you run out of interesting things to entertain them ... Then, you take out your BTK Kller movie and say: "Do you want to see this fucking movie that I did once?"
