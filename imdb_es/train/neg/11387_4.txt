Medell√≠n is a fabulous place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I never heard anything about the activities of the guerrillas, the paramilitaries who took tourists hostage or anything like that. There are "invisible cops", but * no * is a Big Brother system. There are enough policemen to be visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without good reasons. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary in which the young people he represents in the film essentially become his place. characters. The directors of the film carefully sculpt the lines of the plot between the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there is a true pathos. It is hard to imagine, however, that the three young people are all members of the Metro Block, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> The Sierra is not an accurate representation of life in Colombia; There are, of course, things to watch out for, such as misdemeanors, but when you consider that the theft occurs in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem so different after all. Colombians are waiting impatiently for their chance to show the world that the country once devastated by the war is now thriving more than ever.
