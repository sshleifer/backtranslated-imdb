Before explaining the "Alias" comment, let me say that "The Desert Path" is bad even by westerns standards that look at the Three Stooges. In fact, he presents Carmen Laroux as Juanita's bad and bad girl. When you hear her Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as Miss Rita from the classic Stooge "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail" John Wayne plays the character of Moe Howard and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like his Stooge counterparts, one gag running throughout the 53-minute film is Moe hitting Curly. The character of Wayne, a skirt that persecutes the stalker, is not very attractive, but it is supposed to be the good one. <br /> <br /> When playing a traveling rodeo, cowboy Wayne holds the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes home the prize he would have earned if attendance income had been good. The other runners have to settle for 25 cents. dollar (actually, even less after Wayne steals the box office). No explanation is given for the way Wayne swindled the riders and is still considered the hero who takes the girl. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated at the moment because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his partner Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix, who would play Sheriff Micah on "The Rifleman" television) sees Wayne steal The box office and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are blamed. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to get away from the law and change their names to Smith and Jones. Who they meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the second half of the love interest (Miss Rita stays behind in the old town and does not make more appearances in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is very well played by a beautiful and radiant Mary Kornman (now grown, but in her youth was one of the members of the original cast of the shorts of "Our Gang" by Hal Roach ). Kornman is the main reason to see the mega-lame western and his scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than the others in the production, as if they used a completely different team to film them. <br /> <br /> Even by 1935 the action sequences on this are extremely weak and the technical realization of movies is astonishingly bad. The two main scenes of the chase end with footage of a rider's file falling off a horse. On both occasions, the editor trims a picture of one of the characters rolling on the floor, but there is no horse in the picture, the material of the film is completely different, and the character has different clothes than the rider of the trick. There is a liberal use of archival material elsewhere, none of them even remotely convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to keep in mind is a scene halfway through the film where Moe and Curly climb their horses and move away (to the right of the screen) from a cabin while the gang advances galloping towards the cabin from the left. . The cameraman follows the two puppets with a slow movement to the right and then makes a whip to the left to reveal the approaching gang. Outside of the home movies I have never seen anything like this, not because it looks stupid (what it does) but because a competent director would never make a scene in this way. They would film the two pilots leaving and then reposition the camera and film the gang as a separate action. Or if they felt creative, they would stage the sequence for the camera to show the runners in the foreground and the gang approaching the bottom. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
