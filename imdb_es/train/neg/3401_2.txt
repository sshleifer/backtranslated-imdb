I rented this movie after having heard that the scandal had not been presented for an Academy Award, but after seeing it, it is easy to see why it did not. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow, even though it has almost no plot. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a child who tries to accept the death of his parents in what he may or may not have had. It was an accident (the movie is never clear on this), and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy tales. Fairy tales contain the only fragments of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not really seem to have any point. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale in particular refers to a child who tries to bring a magic flower to his dying girlfriend to save his life, but the child delays by trying the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous resulting in the fact that he arrived a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend, the grandfather declares that the moral is that the child was too impatient, but that does not make any sense because it was an excess of caution and a slowness what that resulted in his failure. The perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> However, Skye's photography is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was released this year, is another film about fairy tales filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed, and is infinitely better than this one.
