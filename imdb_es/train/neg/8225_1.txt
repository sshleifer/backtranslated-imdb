DO NOT LOOK AT THIS EXCUSE CHEERFUL FOR A MOVIE. I have wasted time and money on this and I am quite worried about that. <br /> <br /> The acting is comparable to the plays of the high school. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I think should be rewarded for reaching) I had a headache for all the screams, cries and laments that the five girls make. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rare for a movie today) suggested instead of being represented graphically, but I found the characters so irritating that I wanted to see them and, in fact, all the people involved in it the creation of this piece of s ** t, die in the most horrible way possible. <br /> <br /> I spent ten more minutes of my life saving you from your 100 very poor minutes. Do not do it
