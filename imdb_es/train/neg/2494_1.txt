What a joke I'm watching it on Channel 1 and I think that seeing dry paint is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that got him into this nightmare. Terrible performance, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of suspense, but it's more of a comedy. If you want to see a terrible performance, a ridiculous writing of scripts and a plot below the average, watch this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not only ask my agent 10%, but I would fire the bastard in the process. That Turkey. He is not even fit to be in MST 3K! It would be a good movie to cure your insomnia. Especially I love the part where Van Dien throws himself overboard and then comes back in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that this was written by non-union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie!
