As a "failed Catholic" who had 11 years of Catholic school, but has not gone to church in 35 years, except at weddings and funerals, I thought I would love it. And I did it . . . for the first two thirds of the movie. They were all standard things: strict teachings of the parochial school, repressed sexuality, etc. But then, suddenly, the movie became bad. Really meant. Now look, I saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit. . . and perhaps I would not have been so offended by such unpleasant and odious excavations in the Catholic Church had I known about those abominations (what a Catholic term!) and cover-ups. <br /> <br /> It's been a few years since I rented the video and will not rent it again with a new perspective. It just left such a dirty, unpleasant and ugly taste in my mouth. . . I wonder what experience all the actors had with the Church, either because they * really * hated it, or were insulted by the paycheck. It's an incredibly anti-Catholic movie, offensive to anyone who has a flash of respect for Catholic education. Which I keep doing because there were no better teachers in the 50s. Whatever else these nuns did, they forced me to learn to read and write in English. They made us memorize. (How many children today can do simple arithmetic on their heads?) The truth is that there is nothing more essential for success in the United States. You can read? Can you already add / subtract / multiply / divide? Cool. You can get any advanced degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will keep you in a good position, not only as you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic "mythology" that we all had to learn. <Br /> <br /> A great deal, a terrible and rotten writing. I really feel bad (and no, it's not "wrong", believe me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project must have been those bad (that is, stupid) children who sat in the back of the room, if they were willingly involved in making this film.
