I really liked this show, once upon a time. That is, until I realized all the flaws in it. It is so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even credible. This is the why. ** Spoilers people ahead ... ** Are we really supposed to believe that a child like Yugi would descend from a pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Let's go! It is the largest nerd on the face of the Earth. And what about Pharaoh's hair (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked, the pharaohs shaved (except for a little hair on top of their heads) and wore elegant hats. <br /> <br /> And, we're supposed to be convinced that an evil and rich genius, called Seto Kaiba. Can you legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a small, poor quality school like 'Domino High'? Puh-leeze! In the first place, you would have to be legally an adult to run a company. And that would not make him a genius of children, since he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he attend a school like 'Domino High', when his business is clearly successful enough to attend a snobbery academy? In addition, the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame. Every time you turn around, that child has been kidnapped by thugs for the bad guy. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor child, who lives with a father who is worthless. He says that Joey earns all the money to attend his school, because his father is an alcoholic, but you never see Joey doing anything that resembles work. He does not even mention the work. And his sister Serenity is a complete imbecile. Why would he choose a snob like Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog costume and humiliated him publicly on television) to a good guy like Tristan? Is she really that clueless? Several characters throughout the show, are possessed by demonic forces, their souls are stolen by demonic forces and are victims of mental illness. (Oh, that's safe for children, NO.) Tea is the typical type of girl next door, whose only purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And although she has some interesting points for her, she simply does not have enough time to shine as a main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is just horrible. All the characters look sick and anorexic. The perspectives are terrible (especially when close-ups are made of someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the plot of the series was the fact that Yami says that his Millennium Puzzle can send souls to their bodies. If this was so, why did not he save Yugi's grandfather in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself the trouble of recovering it? <br /> <br /> All that really is, is a Commercial by itself. The only positive side of this is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abbreviated Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more worthwhile. I like it, look at the abbreviated version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
