['That&#39;s what I found myself saying again and again in the third act, remarkably inept, of this unfortunate excuse for a movie. First of all, the effects of the computer are absolutely amazing! Those computer wizards really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /><br /> None of the characters act realistically, especially in the despicable third act mentioned above (I promise I will not reveal it, but believe me, it&#39;s not worth keeping a secret!). Many laughs in the film come involuntarily, as when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please give the viewers more credit than that! <br /><br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? Nobody could catch you! These subjects were treated much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man of 1933. There is a particular scene of violence that is incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once again. If more attention had been paid, the crazy scientist Kevin Bacon might have made a bit more sense. <br /><br /> The movie would actually be much more successful as porn, since the premise could be done in a unique and interesting way. But this work ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /><br /> 3/10']
