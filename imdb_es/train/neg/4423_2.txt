['Another of the many almost forgotten films produced by Poverty Row in the 1930s, resurrected by the magic of the DVD. <br /><br /> Protagonist of the universal player Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein films) as a pair of twins involved in a murder scam. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks the witnesses the exact time, while the other is deaf and is shown to be &quot;innocent&quot; because he could not have spoken to witnesses. <br /><br /> Of course, where it crumbles is if it was a congenital deafness, would not both be deaf? Oh good. <br /><br /> Atwill does a good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else here can really be worth it.']
