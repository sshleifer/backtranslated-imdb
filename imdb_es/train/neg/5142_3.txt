After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he did one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin made approximately one third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, shooting, etc. This takes place on a race track where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also there with her friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of his friends and those of Mabel. Then, courts Mabel in the gallery without apparent repercussions for his behavior. A lot of slapstick here, but there is very little else to recommend this movie for others other than watching the development of Chaplin. The impression I saw was very deteriorated, which may have affected his enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * 4 stars
