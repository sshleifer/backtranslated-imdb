The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller (with a surprising look a year after "Tarzan and the Huntress") is bad, despite all the curiosities that one can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to say goodbye to Weissmuller, shoot in beautiful landscapes in Mexico, with one of the best stars of that country (Andrea Palma) and award-winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, and bring the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin. marker. Although it may have cost less to shoot abroad, it seems more expensive than any other RKO movie in the series, taking advantage of the beaches of Acapulco and the royal pyramids like Aquatania, and with stunning scenery for all the scenes related to the temple of the god Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gives him a very slow pace. Neumann had done an excellent job with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the leopard woman" and "Tarzan and the hunter", and finished his career directing the classic "La mosca" the year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career of few notable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee who plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a disgusting postman who sings horrendous songs (which have a Caribbean flair, in a place that is supposed to be Africa and that was filmed in Mexico!) Bored and decidedly of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell for the Tarzan de Weissmuller.
