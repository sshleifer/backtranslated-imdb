STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, after of having defeated Freddy at the end of the last movie, is now trying to readjust his life. But his unborn child is leading a demonic presence, Freddy, trying to leave his world again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to watch the directors who had their great opportunities directing Freddy's films: Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Good Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2). But while Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO did some A list with this entry, which should be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story is spreading as far as you can get here, with Freddy ridiculously a father and the ridiculous baby demon looking ridiculous. Even in about an hour and a half, everything becomes pretty boring, and of course, it's not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The slogan "bon appetit, bitch" is the only memorable point of this other Entrance knew very forgettable. *
