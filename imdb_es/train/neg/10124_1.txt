There is no suspense in this series! When an episode ends, the acting is so bad, the effects are so bad and the script is so horrible that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is to watch the next episode! This show is so boring that I can not see how it was done, much less released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not up to the contemporary Batman films, but even the script is horrible. I'm not sure it's an incomprehensible rumor about some evil teacher and a lightning gun or something like that, because it's too horrible to follow. Look at the version of the 60s, or the 90s versions, or even Batman Begins, anything about this version!
