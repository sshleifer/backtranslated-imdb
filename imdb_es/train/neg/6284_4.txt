I liked the initial premise of this movie, which is what led me to catch it, but the problem I found quickly is that you know pretty well what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over of all the world). <br /> <br /> There is no real spin (which is fine), but the final revelation does not make much sense either (how can it be tormented by uncertainty and fear for the whole movie, if she is a bad identification beyond the mirror?). <br /> <br /> It's true that the scenes "beyond the mirror" were getting cold when they first appeared and the murder of the blonde is also really creepy, but ultimately, unfortunately this seems to be a movie in looking for a story or a more attractive script, piling the atmosphere on the atmosphere and sound design for 80 to 90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it becomes quite boring.
