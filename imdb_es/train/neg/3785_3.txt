Spoken like a real gangsta u'an boiled. The story is not worse than any number of gangster movies, but never confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same category. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is that all these Italian Americans are swirling and releasing evil gangsta lines with an even more false accent. Pacino would have been great if they could have nicknamed him. I really wanted to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their shrill accents spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would have made him disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling at him and patting him on the back all the time.
