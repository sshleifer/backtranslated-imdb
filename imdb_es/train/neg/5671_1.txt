If you like to see the skinned animals alive, their heads shattered, the dogs with the throats crushed by my men, stepping on them, this is for you! But if you are somewhat normal and do not need to see real images of animal cruelty, this happens. This movie tries to surprise the viewer, and sure enough. With the animal snuff at first, and the killing of babies in the movie (at least fake) was enough to turn it off. I've seen movies like this before that shows slaughterhouse images (BTK movie) and these kind of images should not be allowed in a horror movie. We look at blood and horror because we know it's just makeup and special effects, so we should not sit down and watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, it's not what we rent it for. If there is something, there should be a great warning label on this type of garbage films so that people do not be surprised. As a fan of the horror very hard, it turned my stomach. All the cast and crew of the film need to check their heads.
