This film is not entertaining in any way, but rather a deep look at the depths of the darker side of human behavior. Relating in a general way half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action takes place during some very hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat is perhaps responsible for the anger and hatred in the film. For me, the treatment of the delayed girl by the security equipment salesman was the worst episode, followed closely by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the "scum" floor. You will be trapped and I hope this movie horrifies you. I hated it but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for "fun" 8/10 to show "man" as it sometimes is.
