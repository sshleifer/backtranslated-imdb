Witchy Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in an isolated hotel and removes them one by one in twisted and disgusting ways. I thought I had seen it all until an unfortunate man here was crucified and then his head caught fire. Hildy is also a good prankster: he takes an annoying harpy and closes his mouth ... then hangs it upside down in the fireplace just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchcraft" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by competent people ... until the end. I have to admit that I loved the ending. It's about a child and his toy recorder cornered by Linda Blair with a fantastic look. The scene only lasts about a minute and the movie ends, but you know the old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you for almost anything."
