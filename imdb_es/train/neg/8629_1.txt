Dear Richard, I know we all love you in Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do not you have anything else to do besides the aftermath of Air Bud? I thought Tim might have given him a small role now or even become his personal assistant. I know it seems ironic, but the benefits of payment are much more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you with Tim and instantly think of "Tool Time". You would even get papers with Bob Vila more often. Instead, you show up for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smile. I know there was not much script, but you could have added it. Well then. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does not do anything for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, the false puppies that speak are more cuckolded than actually seeing the dogs playing sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know it more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
