Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners, perhaps the most ingenious work ever written, is almost in ruins at the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is, as one would expect, casually, indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries an accent on the stage with alternative sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe that this is a melodrama and not a comedy; in fact, all the production has bookends that reduce it to a tragedy, without a doubt the Hays office insisted. The management of Preminger seems to reside mainly in making sure that there are many servants and even that the music seems banal. Stay with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the work for the pleasure of the words. But skip this version.
