Devil Hunter gained notoriety due to the fact that he is on DPP's "Video Nasty" list, but he really should not have done it. Many of the films on the list were there for God (and DPP) only for known reasons, and while this is not the purest of all; There is not much here that justifies the prohibition ... which is a pity, because I would never have been sitting without being on the "shopping list". In reality, the plot gives the film a decent foundation, or at least more than a decent base than most cannibal movies, and follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. Then a hunter is hired to find it, but on the way he has to challenge the natives, led by a man who calls himself "El Diablo" (hence the title). Basically, the movie only lasts eighty-five minutes and there really are not many scenes of interest. It's a real pity that Jess Franco ends up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; such as movies like The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good movies are just gems in the trash heap and Devil Hunter is a very important part of the trash. I saw this movie simply because I want to be able to say that I have seen everything on the DPP list (there are only two more!), And I suppose that is why most of the people who saw it saw it. But if you're not looking for Nasties; There really is no reason to worry about this.
