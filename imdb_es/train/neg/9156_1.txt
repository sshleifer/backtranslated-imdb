Ben and Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director and left the performance to someone who could act. This is a good example of a person who controls all production. There was no one to tell him, "Sam, this is bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's performance was the only positive point, but it could have been much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). The acting and direction was so bad, this movie became a comedy. You just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point ... this would be a great movie for an appointment. After the first two minutes, you would stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
