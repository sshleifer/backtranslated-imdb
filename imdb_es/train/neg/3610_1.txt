A patient escapes from a psychiatric hospital and kills one of his caregivers and then a professor at the university after he goes to the local university. The next semester, the replacement of the late professor and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of murders. The dialogue is so clich√© that it is hard to believe that I could predict lines in quotation marks. This is one of those cheap movies that were released together in the middle of the eighties era. Despite killing heroin, this is just garbage below the standard. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just nonsense to put on your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you look at the headband of your head, that would be more entertaining. Skip it and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rating R for strong graphic violence, blasphemies, brief nudity and sexual situations.
