This is one of the worst B slashers I've seen in my life. The end is something you have to see to believe. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the fireplace while they are dressed in a Santa suit. Put the gifts under the tree, eat the cookies and milk and then climb back up the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry goes down to find his father dressed in a Santa suit sexually pleasing his mother. Then, Harry climbs the stairs, breaks a snowball, grabs a piece of glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then you continue with the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and watches young children with binoculars. He has two books A book for good children and another for bad children. Write down everything they do in these books. The boy is crazy. He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a nice house. <br /> <br /> When Harry discovers that his boss only cares about the profits, he goes to collect all the toys and gives them to some children. . Then, travel to a church and kill 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree. The children catch him but they go back to bed. Then, Harry goes to the bedroom, kills the father and leaves. <br /> <br /> While walking towards a house, a group of children see it and run towards it. The parents are nervous and try to get their children back with them so they do not get hurt. How do you know that Harry is the killer? Of course, you should suspect because you never know who it could be. Harry gives gifts to the children and the father pulls a blade from the switch in an attempt to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs out, the townspeople light torches and follow him to kill him. They do not even know that he is the murderer. When Harry arrives at his brother's house, his brother and he talk a little and Phillip strangles him. Only lose consciousness. Phillip loads Harry back into his truck. When Harry wakes up, he leaves. <br /> <br /> The ending is something I could not believe. Once again, you will have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me was Santa's black. That's right, the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man. So, why did they bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip this and go to Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You will get the value of your money by watching those two movies. They are better than this pile of garbage! I give this movie 1 star of 10. I wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this movie deserves.
