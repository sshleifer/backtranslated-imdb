I saw this on television. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on the rent. The film is totally predictable, from the corrupt owner and planner to the electrical cables that snake. The plot is really weak and incredible: the expert in avalanches is hit by a wave of avalanches to break bones (with real images) and all he has to do is get up and shake. The avalanche drops to one million miles per hour and stops on the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the things on the scene makes this movie look even weaker. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with this, not even in T.V.
