Oh, my God, Jerry can be the undisputed king of chats, but movies are a completely different ball game, and it's out of reach. The script for this film is so poor that you have to see it to believe it and it's sad to see actors as vaguely familiar as Michael Dudikoff (80's action? B'movie king), Michael Jai White (Last seen on the flop of Sci Fi "Spawn"), as well as William MacNamara (who is involved in the one fun situation of the whole movie!) Of Surviving the Games! They are inclined to get a job. If you're a Jerry fan, stay in your TV show, since it's a total waste of an hour and a half. After I finished reading this, I could see the last half hour of Rocky 5 on television, which in comparison seemed like a cinematic masterpiece, I think that's more than enough. <br /> <br />
