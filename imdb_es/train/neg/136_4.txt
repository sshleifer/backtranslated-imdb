*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teen slasher movies suffer a drought of originality? That seems terribly. First, this is a noble premise that could have been used well. A rejected young nerd who grows up, stalks and murders all the girls who tortured him to death when he was in high school? I can not say that you have nothing to work with. But this movie has the same movements as all the other recent slashers. Everything from scoring to camera angles allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm will arrive and exactly when the killer will attack. We already know the pattern. These stupid slasher movies push the envelope of credibility more and more per minute. Let me ask you something: who, in his right mind, will surprise a friend of his in a dark and dreary morgue in the middle of the night and will only surprise her out of nowhere while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. A good shot involves the massacre of the character of Denise Richards. She is trapped inside a pool and the killer hits her with a chainsaw. There are some good songs on the soundtrack, including a great Orgy song. The music video is in the special features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even acting is, at best, mediocre. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal of the title character in "Angel." However, Denise Richards is a good actress and keeps a stone face throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is as you would expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheesy and without a good scare. view. Do not even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
