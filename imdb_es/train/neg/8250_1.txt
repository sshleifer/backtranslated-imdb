I ordered the Korean film because I had an extra in it and I was interested in seeing how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing her, I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part. I feel embarrassed not only by myself but by all those who participated in the mockery of the British "comedy". <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, the film is predictable, tedious, boring, monotonous and I shrugged my shoulders to the point where, on several occasions, I looked away from the screen with disappointment. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic a romantic comedy can be. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, it's a bad movie. In one scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the warning points of when and how to clean them. I will put details of this in the 'Goofs' section. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment?)
