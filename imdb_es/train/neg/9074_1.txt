Another adventure in the field of adolescent-disgusting comedy, set in a university campus that presents a nerdy search for coldness, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular sportsmen to get the girl. Everything has been done before, and everything has been done in a much more satisfactory way. The crude humor that has made teen movies like "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my Car" is so popular that it's out of context in this installment, appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written, and the actors never make anything of it even a little bearable. I will not even dignify this terrible image by divulging, since it is a waste of my time and yours. In the best case, Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter, and in the worst case it is unbearably bad and, sometimes, completely unrecoverable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his debut with Rushmore, humbles himself by appearing in this photo and one wonders how a race can end up in the bathroom so fast. Please, avoid, please, avoid. Save your money
