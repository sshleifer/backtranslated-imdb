The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a label that was given to the senator and that was based on the public's ignorance about the aircraft of the Second World War. The rear-facing movable pistols were supported by a bolt that would prevent the rear gunner from firing from the tail of the aircraft by preventing the gun from firing when pointing to the tail. When the senator was practicing on the ground one day, he managed to shoot from the tail of the plane. I could not have done that if the weapon had been correctly aligned. The artillery officer responsible for that admitted, in public, before a cameraman, who was responsible: he had made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact shows how partial it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was the PBS special that was made about him. He was a hardworking, intelligent and ambitious politician who overcame the extraordinary disadvantages to reach extraordinary levels. He made some mistakes, some serious, but shooting a plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple, one-sided stories. Stories, so you do not have to think.
