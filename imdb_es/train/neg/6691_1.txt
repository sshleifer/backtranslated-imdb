MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, MAKE ME BE THIS MOVIE! What drugs are you in? This could be the worst movie of all! I felt like I was on a bad trip with acid all the time, I need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From beginning to end, the luminous strings are a profane masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought about watching this movie with my best Jewish friend and his family, we thought "oh, hey, this can be funny! It will probably be bad but still a little funny" how wrong we were, we were not prepared for how horrible this was. could be. All my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the movie was over, and during the course of the film, one of my friends tried to hang himself with his belt while another tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I had seen the video of The Ring, that way the pain and suffering will end in just seven days. For all who wish to see this movie, they are NOT PREPARED! You may think you're a kind of "rough guy" when renting this, but this movie will break you, push you to the floor and piss you off.
