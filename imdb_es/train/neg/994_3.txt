This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay, basically it's about a girl who is raped, and to get her revenge she gets another man to rape the rapist. The rapist is an idiot, but the victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she does not allow it, so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is that the rape scene for the girl is very short and really does not expose or show anything, but when it comes to raping the rapist, it's a very long rape scene. Basically, there is nothing in history that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
