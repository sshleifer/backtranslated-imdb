SNL is quite funny, but people who say that this is like watching a short skit on SNL is a bit silly. It's NOTHING like SNL, it's just stupid shit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy does everything possible and people think it's fun. <br /> <br /> Only the funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently fun with Andy was the part of the pool. <br /> <br /> They could have greatly improved the "quiet place" if they had not done the damn scene for 3 minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he is most pronouncing his H's is delayed. They try to use the program too long and half of the time it seems that Andy laughs while acting ... he is a horrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for the simple-minded people with the brains of a comedy level of 10 years. Which is about half of the United States.
