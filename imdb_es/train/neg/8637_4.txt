More of a mystery movie with some free horror elements thrown; Mediocre in general. <br /> <br /> Start with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sexual partner gets out of bed, enters her child's room crying and kills her. She wakes up. So, that man is dying in a hospital, spitting blood. His separated daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through his dreams (I believe), and wants her to discover who killed him before his body completely decomposes in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not much mystery about who did it, or even how; most of the spectators will have discovered it long before it is revealed. I'm not sure the way they killed him really would have worked. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the horror elements arrive: a bloody autopsy, the recurring dream of the man who kills the child, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man, both in the nightmares and in the grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see a dedication at the end of Fulci. to Clive Barker! Interesting.
