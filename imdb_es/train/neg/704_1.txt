A romantic stain of the sexual exploitation of black women in New Orleans by white men of power and privilege. Oh Does that open your appetite? Well, then, kneel to a VHS or DVD and enjoy this free trolling through a segment of the story. To a large extent, it is adapted from the book by the famous hack Anne Rice. The direction is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialogue. Most of the acting is amateur. The only valuable note of the production is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, all of whom have barely been employed in the current market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that have barely been seen at all. (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell) It is also, in spite of itself, an excellent showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and heavy James Earl Jones is also available. Then, it is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This movie must be classified "T" by gut.
