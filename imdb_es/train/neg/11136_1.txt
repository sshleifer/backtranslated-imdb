This is the second time that I feel compelled enough to comment on imdb about a movie. The first time was probably for the best movie I've seen in my life and that was for Memento. <br /> <br /> See Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've seen I had the misfortune to see. Apart from the two scenes that contain nude women, there is nothing in this movie to get it out of the garbage pile that it is. <br /> <br /> Let's see, frightening effects, clich√© script, bad acting and also about 90 minutes. long. My wife and I laughed at most of the story in disbelief at how bad they were. Surprisingly I saw it until the end, how I did that I do not know! AVOID!!!
