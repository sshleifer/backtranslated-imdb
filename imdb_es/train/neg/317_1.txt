This has to be the worst movie I've ever tried to see. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and I had a lot of time to dedicate myself to a movie just to have fun. The condo in which we were staying had this movie in stock; They must have bought it at the $ 1 store or something like that. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he has ever done. This started with a bad premise and then got worse. There's nothing even remotely funny about him. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies, including some that did not interest me. But if you decide to waste your time in this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
