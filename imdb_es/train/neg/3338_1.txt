It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I have seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child becomes a serial killer. How about something new for a change? How about a battered child becomes a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why do everyone who has a camera and a movie idea (especially non-original movie ideas) think they can be directors? I admire the fact that they stayed with this movie for 9 years to complete it. That shows tenacity and spirit. With this type of unit, I hope that next time you can concentrate on a better script. If you want to see a failed experiment in independent filmmaking by a writer / director in Michigan, see The One Minute Hate. If you want a good movie by a Michigan writer / director, stay with Evil Dead.
