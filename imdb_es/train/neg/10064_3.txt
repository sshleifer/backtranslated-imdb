The pokemon movie was a terrible movie. unlike the first, this is not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built on it. In the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. Brock's subtraction and Tracey's addition was bad. Tracey does not really have much to say or do, and unlike Brock does not offer any comedic relief. The only positive points are that you can see misty really getting jealous of the ashes, and her early concern for being called her girlfriend was entertaining. In general, this movie is not worth renting and the previous short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. Well, maybe the next one is better. cant ge t much worse
