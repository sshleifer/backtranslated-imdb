I'm surprised that @ IMDb reviewers gave this TV movie a rating as high as they did. It's a harmless, sweet and uncomplicated clich√© of a movie that had two great names from the past (both did a decent job), but this movie stinks of low-budget work that we can watch any day of the week on the least cable channels . I like a good romance as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this, and before seeing the classification, we said: "There are people who are going to rate this movie too simply because there is nothing in it". to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good movie like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was the fan's time. There are some pretty good movies rated much lower than this one. Truly, another in a long line of unfortunately inadequate holiday movies. Watch The Family Stone. It is far ahead of this mess.
