A true disappointment of the great visual master Ridley Scott. AMERICAN SOLDIER. Jane tells the story of a first woman to go through hell training in the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and difficult that exists, as the instructor in the film says to the main character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this movie or I could not reach it correctly. It may be a kind of declaration of rights and feminine abilities, but everything collapses under the tired scenes and the stupid gun fight at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why he uses Ridley. So much zooms in the last armed combat in the desert? It seems incredibly stupid and irritating and almost amateur, so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I watch his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (which are many) and they are very intense and skillfully directed. All the final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more than stupid shots and assassinations without a brain. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is Ridley Scott's worst movie and there are no significant details about this great director. Still, I'm glad I saw this in widescreen because there are still a couple of great scenes and examples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics. (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien, etc.) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
