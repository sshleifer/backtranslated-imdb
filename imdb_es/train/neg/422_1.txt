Much death happens in nature. You do not need to be a space scientist to realize that! But does it have to be the focus of a documentary of nature? What about this fascination with dreadful death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant destroyed by a group of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah that grabs a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, nothing less! I thought this was going to be a movie of a family-friendly nature! <br /> <br /> And, why not have the courage to show the frightful violence in the advances of the film? Did the filmmakers fear losing money? <br /> <br /> Then, in a comic relief mode, we can see the magnificent Birds of Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration that is humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers thought they were just heading to a room full of first and second grade students on a field trip! Woohoo! From the average to the moronic in the blink of an eye! <br /> <br /> If there is a future documentary of nature waiting in the wings reading this review of the film, why not focus on: the animals really copulating; Giving birth; laying eggs; bathrooms; asleep; cleaning one another socialize playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors, such as brooding the mouth; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; Parenting, healing skills, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or letting go of beauty, and why not be much more complete and, instead, focus on delight and inspiration?
