If this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. There is nothing funny or intelligent in this crapfest. I have not seen the original movie, this is the new version of (a 1950 movie), but it just has to be better than this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> A Major is expelled from the armed forces for being a marginal element, and ends up teaching the children in a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the eldest is Daman Wayans ... so the children are in a world of humorless and annoying asinity. Can the Wayans put these losers in shape? Can you get him to become a little more human? The film bombs like most Wayans movies, with only a few brilliant moments. William Hickey gets about a minute of screen time, very little. This charming old man (known to me as an actor from "Tales from the Crypt", better known as Uncle Louis from "Christmas Holidays") shines every moment that appears on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a motorcyclist, which suits him perfectly. I would not mind a bit more Bam Bam, but I think he played the role of "biker" to the extent that he could be taken to a military movie. <br /> <br /> And then there is the attractive teacher, that someone falls in love with Major Payne even though he treats children badly, has no social skills and it is simply impossible to become someone with whom he would like to spend time. She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which one (although it would seem "stupid" since the movie makes it clear that she leaves the house often enough). <br /> <br /> Wayans had a brilliant moment: a dance sequence where he acts. a series of movements (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of the music of 2 Live Crew. This scene was nice, but it's almost not done for anything that has spit on this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie about a loser who helps lost children become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he's a friendly loser, and actually funny. Maybe if Commander Payne had fought a badger, I would feel better, but he did not. Forget about Payne, forget about Wayans ... you can do much better.
