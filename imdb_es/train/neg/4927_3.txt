Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary through film, wrote, directed and produced other films about controversial issues, but this may be the first to obtain a broad vision, thanks to TCM. This movie is his accusation of abortion, but he cleverly solves the problem by incorporating eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. His talent for writing and the other cinematographic skills are shown here, but one can be forgiven for wishing he had used them in a less didactic way. If you've asked yourself what the "famous father" of Tyrone Power, Jr. looked like, this is your chance. The fashion and automobiles of 1916 are also exhibited to increase the interest of this museum piece. It's nice even if you do not appreciate the propaganda.
