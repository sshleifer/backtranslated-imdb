This film, originally released at Christmas 1940, was considered lost for a long time. A very poor copy has resurfaced and has become a CD, now for sale. I did not buy it! The movie is indescribably terrible. The casting is bad, the script is horrible and the direction is terrible. <br /> <br /> Imagine Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
