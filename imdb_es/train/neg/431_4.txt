It is true that I find Al Pacino a guilty pleasure. He was a good actor until Aroma of a woman, where he apparently had an overdose of himself in an irreparable way. I was hoping that this movie, of which I had not heard much when growing up, was a little gem. A political thriller of the city overlooked, advanced, intelligent and captivating. It is not. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a film that clouds its plot with so many characters, names and "realistic" themes from all over the city, which for a time you think is a plot of such broad scope and implied, that a Once you discover the truth, your mind will fly. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions ultimately result in commercial brands of urban histories that are quite domestic and very familiar, such as Power Corruption, Two-Sided Politicians, Mafia with police links, etc. And, in theory, this configuration allows for exciting tension. They fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But, once again, it's not like that. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we have several "confession" monologues left, which are meant as a whole to form a modern One kind of fable, a lesson in moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of missing names and reports and a network of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated with a somewhat satisfying revelation. I do not think we'll stick with that at City Hall, and although it's a very complete movie, I do not find it completely rich.
