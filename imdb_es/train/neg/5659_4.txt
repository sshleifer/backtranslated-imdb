A disappointing ending to a season that started so well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were among the best viewed on television of all series, while this was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was the episode that disappointed me, but the cheesy guitar music that accompanied the final sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the corporate executives would not like the end of the low profile note and would like to encourage it. They failed and ruined everything. <br /> <br /> Let's hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> Even so, at least, we saw the return of a certain person, even if it is a little strange and crushed fact
