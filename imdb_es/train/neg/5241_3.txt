I tell the truth, I am a little surprised to see all these positive reviews from so many people, which is also the main reason why I really decided to watch this movie. And after having seen it, I was very disappointed, and this comes from the guy who loves this genre of film. <br /> <br /> I am completely surprised of this movie, it is like the film of a child with nudity for no reason and everything involves little children who curse and curse. I'm not entirely fair, but this has really gone too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story of two boys was sent to the big brother's show for his reckless behavior. There they met a boy with obsession for the breasts and the other is a medieval monster. <br /> <br /> The name itself is not really related to the story. They are not being a role model and they do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (although it is expected) and humor is scarce. And we have not seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin ') in so many other films (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting was fine, after all, he's the one who produced the script. And the acting is more or less as expected when you're watching this kind of movie. And the address, what is expected? This is the same guy that Wet Hot American Summer brought us, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to attract some star to attract his horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I did not feel the total riff but a waste of time. Only the nude scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I really can not see why I should recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's not funny, terrible story, nudity and children do not mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (grade: F)
