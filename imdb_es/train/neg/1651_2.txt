A badly written script without sympathetic characters. As for being a comedy, I forgot to laugh. These are 2 cocky friends who cheat so that women go to bed too often (without sex scenes) and another friend (which is almost strange) that sometimes also scams, but mainly is considered as the guy who dominates. The 3 friends meet separately and fall in love with the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 guys stop being friends since they went separately with her. She cheated them for their friendship because they cheated the women. - a bad movie
