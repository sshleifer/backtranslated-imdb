Well, I finally saw the remake last night in London, unintentionally, hilarious, sexless and without any real humor. I really do not know where to start, while this strange tribute entertained me, it really did not move me. The performance is screaming, there is no original music, the costumes are too 'Disney', there is a ridiculous insert 'six months later' after the burning of Nic Cage (which was not fast enough for my taste). with Cage in the bear suit, the public suppressed the joy, as well as the comedy that drew the "bad guys" from the island. It's such a weird remake that I can not believe I've seen it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip would have done in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood rendition of Miner's Strike, very strange!
