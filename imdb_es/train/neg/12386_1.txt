It's hard to make a fair trial about a movie like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst type of exploitation film. I had the bad luck to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. Then I saw it again earlier this year and once again I was horrified. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fanatic or one who says what others should or should not see, but I was very offended by the way something as horrible as the rape was treated in this film. I love the lowbrow cinema but this is just unpleasant. Rent something from Rus Myer instead.
