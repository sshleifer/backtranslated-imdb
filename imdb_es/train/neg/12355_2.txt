After reading many of the reviews, I do not know what movie some people were watching, but clearly it was not the same as I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The performance, mainly by Moore, is simply terrible. The woman can not act. Good tits, but she just can not act. At no time did he encounter the real character. Instead, it was spoiled. The Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play fantasy with the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's what this movie is ultimately about: the Hollywood fantasy. The training sequences are exaggerated. The policy - above. Political correctness - above. The combat scenes, you guessed it, above. Your mission is to enter and exit without being detected. Then what do you do? Why shoot as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wingmate at any time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood takes over, we end up with Top Gun with boobs. <br /> <br /> What else can you expect from commercial movies in the United States? Not much, I suppose.
