Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was good acting, especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the middle of the comedy, this was simply not an attractive movie. The segments between the comedy part and the tragedy part were uncomfortable or, at times, were not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the support model differs in the two halves; I thought about the way things were arranged in the opening scene that the people surrounding Melinda would be the same people, just reacting differently (more than one premise of "He said, she said"). However, what we have are two totally different stories and two totally different women, both played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two playwrights in the opening scene: the comedian and the tragic, supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only tenuously related. They do little to support the topic of discussion, which is that almost anything can be considered comedy or tragedy. Good cast, but a disappointing movie.
