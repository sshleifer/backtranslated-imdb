This movie was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with a group of film enthusiasts, who have a varied taste in the movies but who always have a good eye for a work of "genius" (as one of my fellow commentators in this site had the nerve to label this steaming pile ??); none of them found a single redeeming quality. We ended the movie with an enthusiastic chorus of insults that I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive criticisms provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. After all, as one of those critics will tell you, did he himself finance the film? because nobody else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, in this case, would risk a single penny or his good name in association with this movie. Do not let the semi-famous actors that appear in the movie fool you? as Christian Slater admits in the special features "making of", he signed up for the film without reading the script or knowing any details (a madness that I'm sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I regret the disadvantage. individual who is in this quagmire of complacency written, directed, produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please, search Google "Anthony Hopkins "And the art).
