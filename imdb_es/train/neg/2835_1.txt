The Dereks seemed to have difficulty finding rolls for Bo after "10". <br /> <br /> I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for "Ghosts can not do it" was circulating among the coaches in the "fish house", where food was prepared for the dolphins. There was a scene in which a-dolphin-supposedly proposed Bo (or Bo the dolphin), asking "go egg-making". When we read the script, we prayed -... <br /> <br /> We did not end up doing any part of this film in our facilities, although our dolphins were in "The Big Blue!" <Br /> <br /> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this movie, since he certainly did not do anything for his legacy.
