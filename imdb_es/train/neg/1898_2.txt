The remake of H.B. The classic Halicki seventies chase movie is simply horrible. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represents the automobile chase movies par excellence. The new version takes the original and places it on its head. While Halicki gave us a 75% car chase and a 25% support drama, at GISS 2000 we got a 25% car chase and a 75% support drama. Cage as super man, save his brother, kiss the girl. MTV editions, tits and ass. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see her baby (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the movie '74') degraded in this way.
