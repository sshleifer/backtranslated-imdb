Seeing this was like receiving a big mackerel slapped over and over again. Even when you thought: "That mackerel surely can not reappear", * slap * there it was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the kind of pilot I observed and I asked myself: "Did the actors know that they were on a doomed ship destined never to become a series?" Not only the black stereotypes, but also the Swedes and Indians. And while "Blazing Saddles" turned these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no plot line, the ending was slapped, and the jokes are not. Still, if you're a comedy student, watch this pilot to see what you should not do.
