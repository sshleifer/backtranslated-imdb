I was really disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and created a great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally came to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just a psychopath with skin problems ... again. Whoop-of-do Another crazy movie ... as if we did not have enough already. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the "creep" is really disturbing to watch, and the way it moves and the strange sounds. It makes them pretty creepy, but I'm tired of renting a movie like this one only to discover that the monster is human, even if it's a twisted monster, insane and monstrous. When I saw all the telltale rats from the beginning, I was expecting some kind of monster rat-monster hybrid thing ... it was a disappointment when the Creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> On top of This, some of the things in this movie do not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell does the Creep kill the security guard? What is the point, apart from sticking a large record of bocinaques that says "Hi, I'm a PSYCHO AND I LIVE HERE!"? It is stupid, and it seems that it only happens to prevent the character of Franka Potente from receiving help. <br /> <br /> What the hell have you been eating there? I got the impression that it was indeed walled, and only the unexpected opening in that section of the tunnel left him free ... so he's been eating rats all that time, and if so, why are they staying so close to him? ? Why is it so hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not exactly at his best ... but he seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that describe non-psychopathic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The comment on the DVD says that they intend to empathize with Creep, but I just find it disgusting. It's a pretty effective movie, but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick.
