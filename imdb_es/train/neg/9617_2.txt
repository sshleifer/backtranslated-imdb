Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother fell out of a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop punishing herself and blaming herself for something she has no control over. So he takes the beer and something to chew and returns to the same lake that has been in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already begun when two of the friends are splashed before they even go to the party. This film has the feeling of a secondary work in which everyone forgot their lines and "winged" ... very bad! The writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatiest role of Rachel's boyfriend, Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there is a bit of a boring performance and some characters that you would like to drown the shit before they are "discarded". Paying attention to some more players who had the nerve to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a day of memory that you would not mind losing.
