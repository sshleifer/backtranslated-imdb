This ridiculous movie offers the standard "hippie mentality" of the '70s in a nutshell and bores us in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young and innocent women with friends from the sex of old age and washed. A naive and young hippy played by the waif type hook (Kay Lenz) walks and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, drinking strong liquor and bathed as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she "loves" him and only knew him, she wears out and is very fast. I could not help laughing all through the movie. It is obvious that he is only using it as a food ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that we are going to buy that there is really no love. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to overtake her because it almost inspired me to vomit. A cheesy offer of music from the 70s is also disseminated through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
