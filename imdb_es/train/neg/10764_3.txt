I will give credit to writer / director William Gove for finding someone to fund this ill-conceived thriller. A good argument for not losing money subscribing to HBO, much less buying DVDs based on covers and advertisements. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco do not add anything significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not so bad. The dialogue will leave you making a face of astonishment at your presumption; This is telling stories at their worst. Without tension, without suspense, without fear, without fear, without empathy, without catharsis, without anything. A few attractive and often naked women spice up boredom, but this is definitely a movie that looks better like a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who gave this thing a green light. Good for night viewing, only in areas. You have been warned.
