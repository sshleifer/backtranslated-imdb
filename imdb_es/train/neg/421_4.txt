My previous title says it all. Let me clarify it. If you have seen the "Planet Earth" of the BBC, which I am sure that most of you have done, then you will not like this movie very much. And I own all the "Planet Earth" albums. I had seen the rating of this film very high and I read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and started watching the movie. I saw that it was a Disney movie with production companies that included the BBC and Discovery. And when the first scenes about the polar bear began, I recognized them on my DVDs at the house of "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie went on and on and on, my friends and I continued to recognize that the scenes were all from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We are very disappointed, since I believe that 90% of the images are from "Planet Earth". I say 90%, because some of the scenes I did not recognize them. I have the feeling that I just did not remember them. <br /> <br /> So, finally, what this film really is is a compilation of different parts of the different albums of the "Planet Earth", with a narration directed to children. Yes, the narration is quite childish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar puppies moving away from the mother cub, the narrator says: "The polar puppies are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but that's the way it is). words. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for children!
