This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both, and not as good as the other. It is also slow and quite predictable. It also has nuances of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus. We got a little taste of the new era and some of those scenes appear as a motivational / inspiring sermon. Actually, this movie is a mix of almost everything. Although it is bloody, the makeup effects are not very realistic. In fact, they seem somewhat cheap. Apart from all that, there is a really horrible clich√©. I will not say when, but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. Nobody in their right mind would have acted in this way. Once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. There is also some gratuitous nudity for the sake of nudity. It just was not necessary. The good news is that the acting was actually pretty good. Better than this movie deserves Then, after carefully weighing the evidence, I would say that this movie was passable, but not good. My verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 4/10
