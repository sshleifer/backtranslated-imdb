I did not even dare to see this movie until the end. I can not comment on the story since I did not see the whole movie and the reason why I could not see it was because of the 'actors'. First of all, for the most part they just looked stiff and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame, but that's a minor problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault ... it's whoever released this movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought that choosing twenty-something people to play teenagers went out of style with the new wave ?! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, of a grown man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can someone take that seriously? Do not be a victim of this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this movie could give.
