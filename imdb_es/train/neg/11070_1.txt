This was a really bad movie. The character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the main reason why this failure, the actor felt that conjuring an incredibly uncomfortable southern accent would make this character more evil, he did not. After about 20 minutes I had wanted a speech therapist to make an appearance, this would have added some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) badly acted - 2) unfriendly characters - 3) raster line of the razor <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
