This movie was announced on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every number. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. But, oh, how sad is this movie! It's a Hollywood movie about a movie in a movie. Shades is so clear that we are not ready to produce "great Hollywood movies". I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject line says, it's nothing, and then looped. You can also watch TV without seeing anything. That was the feeling we have when we saw Shades. Shadows are a bad production!
