Undoubtedly, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought it would help in their film careers. If you have gone through the ordeal of seeing "Swept Away", then you know that on that level it was a fight done in hell. After almost 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress", since she could have pronounced it on "The Next Best Thing"), she still can not get out of herself long enough to perform a performance that anyone with The taste could even call decent. And that's what makes people not like it so much on the screen: that visceral feeling that their ego is so inflated that it prevents them from letting go and connecting with their audience. If there is any justice in this universe, she has just lost her last chance.
