I had no real expectations of entering this film and I'm glad. Even if I had expected it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think that 15% of the film consisted of stationary scarecrow footage in a dark jungle field. I get it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrow" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing is ever explained about scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. Are there too many times when they let me go WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the film takes itself seriously. I am in favor of a B movie with blood cubes, screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But those films often know they are B-movies and even flaunt them, like Dead Snow (Scandanavian's hilarious zombie movie) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems oblivious to its shit. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should have been more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you're going to have a horror movie, do it with murder. And if you're going to have a hot girl and a semi-hot girl, one of them should show a little lateral teat as a minimum. <br /> <br /> Then, as the summary says, omit "Scarecrows" and just get in the eye. Thank you
