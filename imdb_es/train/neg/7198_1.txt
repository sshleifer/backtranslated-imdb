After the ingenious live action of Disney, George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this film. Big disappointment Thread of naked plot, bad performance, bad visual effects. This film was based on the lameness of a single line, the placement of idiotic (and meaningless) products and the most annoying side kick in that car of gadgets. I took two small children to see him and they got bored in the head. The only laugh I got from this movie was a bad wait when you need a laugh, it shows a boy who has it in his groin!
