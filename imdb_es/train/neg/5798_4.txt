This movie is a rather strange mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a trail of black cinema. It's basically a messy pile of different genres, none of which really works as it was supposed to. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is an old boy-star who used to star in happy comic and musical productions at the beginning of his career. In this film, he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is pretty ridiculous inside the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is a man of extremely small youthful appearance. Actually, he was about 30 years old at the time of this movie, but in reality he looks more like a 16-year-old boy. Hearing him tell women like a baby, and listen to bad-mouthed gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he just does not look and feel good. He just is not convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the film mixes many different genres, the story also feels like a messy one. Somewhere there is a crime plot and somewhere there is a romantic plot and another about living your dream, but none of that is due to the disorder and the handling of everything. It just is not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has only made 10 films in his life, despite the fact that his career lasted from 1935 to 1957. He must have been a struggling director who had difficulty getting a job in the industry and, on the contrary, , occasionally. while he was given a minor script to work. His films are all unknown and are usually not of a very high quality either. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is a movie from the 50s, but it still feels more like one of the '40s or maybe like one of the 30s. This is mainly due to the fact that this movie was filmed in black and white. In general, the black and white films of the 50s often look cheap and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty strange sight to see Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and their band as themselves. together in a sequence. However, it was not the only film in which Armstrong appeared and he often appeared in such films, often simply as himself. I guess that jazz lovers can still enjoy watching this movie because of their music, since there is a lot of it present in this movie. The film actually received an Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> A small awkward movie and Mickey Rooney's departure. <br /> <br /> 4/10
