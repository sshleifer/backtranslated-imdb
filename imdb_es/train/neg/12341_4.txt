The parodies of terror are not just a thing of the 21st century. Long before the series 'Scary Movie' there were some examples of this genre, mainly in the 80s. But as the franchise says, most of these films are unpredictable. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above that, but others like 'Saturday 14' and its sequel do not manage to laugh. But of all these types of movies, there is a particularly big aggressor and that is 'Transylvania 6-5000', a big waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: A great cast that does its best. Some silly humor is fun. A cheesy subject, but it captures theme. Some good Transylvanian locations. <br /> <br /> Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tedious step. Most of the humor just does not cut it. Monsters have little to do and little screen time. I thought this was supposed to be a parody of monster movies? Final lick that will probably annoy the spectators. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: Is this a comedy? If so, why are really funny bits so few and far between? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, wishing it were over. I can not believe that Anchor Bay has thrown this tired garbage. I admit that it is not one of the worst movies that have been made, but it is not worth the time or money of anyone, even if you are a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
