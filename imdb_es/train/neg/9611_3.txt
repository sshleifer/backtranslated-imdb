There are so many silly things about this movie that I can not name just a few: <br /> <br /> The BOGART character: 1. His name? Whip McCord (too easy, so I leave it like that, boy, makes "Humphrey" sound good). 2. His long curly hair and his stupid sideburns. 3. Your Black Bart outfit, complete with spurs! 4. I'm not sure what color of lip gloss they have on, but it's nothing too flattering. <br /> <br /> The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. Your lipstick does you no favors. , either. 2. The man is being swallowed by his hat throughout the movie! Could not you find a hat that fits? At least a little?!!?! 3. Your pants are very tight in the back. 4. Take out the smoke from your gun too many times, if you know what I mean, and I think so. <br /> <br /> If you're a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney, and I guess it might be a change of pace to see them in a western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. Even horses are fogged up! (That is, when they do not seem boring). <br /> <br /> To be honest, I admit that Westerns are my least favorite movie genre, but I've still seen a lot, MUCH better than this. <br /> <br /> At a comedy level, or at a high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it is a careful spectator. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see all Westerners out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completista c) any of the above comments are attractive to you. Woah ?? ..
