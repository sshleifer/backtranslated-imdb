I'm in favor of a "bad" horror movie, but this was just a bunch of dogs! How someone can call this cool or decent movie is beyond me. If you like rushed editing to cover special effects, bad acting and a bad script, go ahead! There was no suspense at all and the gore factor was ridiculous because it was very false. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek on this pile any day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows it stinks when she sees one. On the other hand, I stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it would improve. There is no such luck! I have not seen your other Torched movie and I doubt it bothers me now.
