Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought in Walgreens for a whole big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well-spent dollar or a stupidly spent dollar. <br /> <br /> Pretty amazing designs and costumes. Apparently, much thought and effort went into its realization. The sets are very Mexican in their stylization. I liked them a lot. And Santa is awesome. One of the most impressive Santas in movement. I guess the original intention and purpose of this film was to be something edifying and joyful for a child audience. But, somehow, he looks quite upset. In fact, I am stunned at how deranged he is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the dubbing in English that makes it so crazy and weird. One of the reasons why I prefer to experience the films in the original language in which they were created and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unexpected strangeness. Children's voices at least doubled with real voices of children instead of women pretending to be children, which tends to sound very, very rare. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the demons in hell spend their free time dancing around? ballet in your longjohns? You did not? Neither did I until I saw this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching this movie? Now, that's a tossup. I can not, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone, as it is quite disturbing in its own strange way. However, its involuntary strangeness is what makes it worth seeing. You decide what you are going to do. I do not know ... for me, it made me feel uncomfortable to see the demons constantly making ballet moves. Now, that's wrong ...
