I'll say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The performance for the most part is not good (I think only Sky showed some promise) and you feel uncomfortable to see it. All the scenes that should be meaningful are really superficial, like when Ng approaches his parents. There are many cheesy details, like the kanji tattoo on the shoulder of the Sky, the magnets in the refrigerator of the girls and the horrible decoration of the sets ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says in a moment "I'm gay, not cheesy". And he does not realize it. Even the comment is horrible, I turned it off after Ng talks about how he was surprised when he played a lesbian.
