I saw this boring waste of time on the HBO comedy channel, so, quite innocently, I assumed it was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt, after being beaten senseless by torturers of the 15th century Inquisition. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most boring and pointless dialogs I've encountered in a long time, and zero zero in the plot to talk about. The fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and, however, this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell it all. A couple of good shots of waves that hit the cold British coast, but that's it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that is made only because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or a lot of cash out there.
