The good friends of the Webster Dictionary define logofobia as the "fear of words." I can only be a logofóbico. Because no combination of words scares me more than when at the beginning of a movie, the credits contain the words "Produced, Written and Directed by:", and are followed by the name of a single person. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but very few of all kinds. Even the most experienced directors like Speilberg and Scorsese seldom take control of their films. But there I was, all curled up in my theater seat, popcorn in my hand and about to see The Order when they hurled me like a fastball by Nolan Ryan, were the words "Produced, written and directed by Brian Helgeland". Whoa! <br /> <br /> As a movie buff, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography during the last 10 years would be plotted as the stock price of a dotcom company in 1998. There were so many unpleasant theatricals (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory), as well as critical and award-winning hits (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to alternate ?? One good, another bad. Knowing that in his latest film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have exhaled. <br /> <br /> The Order is starring Heath Ledger (A Knights Tale, Helgeland), as Alex Bernier, a priest of an order known as the Carolingians, who is summoned in Rome when a fellow priest is killed in circumstances in which the Arch The bishop considers it curious. When meeting with Father Thomas (also of the Order and marvelously interpreted by Mark Addy of Still Standings), they set out to put together the enigma left behind in the wake of the priest's untimely death. <br /> <br /> Complicating the issues is a secondary plot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mara and, for some reason, unknown to the public, they travel together to Rome. <br /> <br /> They do not have a good night's sleep and Alex faces William Eden (Benno Fürmann) who he claims to be. a devourer of sin centuries old. A sin eater, as we are told, are those who eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, thus allowing entry into Heaven. William, as luck would have it, is tired of a life of healing and expects Alex to assume his role and free him from his mundane duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love, Mara, Alex resorts to the Sin Eater ritual to save her and the transformation is complete. Then, Alex seeks answers to his many questions while Father Thomas reveals the Vatican plot behind the passage of authority to his fellow investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a terrible movie, but it is terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene, that of Alex walking on the dying Mara, is pale and bland and does not leave us any emotional response to the difficult situation of the couple. Everyone seems to speak so quietly and emotionlessly that the film's flat lines and aromatic salts could have been managed to keep him from trying to take a quick nap in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Mr. Helgeland, please do not try again. Share your vision with others and allow the more experienced to help you orient yourself in directions that are not so narrow or selfish. Until then, there is nothing emanating that demonstrates that you are capable of more than a failing grade. Two stars. <br /> <br />
