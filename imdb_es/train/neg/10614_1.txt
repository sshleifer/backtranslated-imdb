This is the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen quite a few movies. It is passed off as an art movie, but in reality it is a piece of trash. One of the redeeming qualities is the beautiful tango dance, but that can not compensate Sally Potter's disgusting homage to herself. The plot of this film is non-existent, and I guarantee you will start laughing at the end. Especially where she starts singing. It is absolutely unreal.
