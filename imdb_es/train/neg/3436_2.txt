A girl is taking a shower without knowing that a serial rapist is looking at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone follow his trail, but not enough when they find him after he kills, rapes and eats a nipple of the girl. He is to death. One would expect this to be the end of the movie. Not because it's too horrible, but because the level of acting is horrifyingly horrible. Unfortunately, it is not the end and months later the rapist is resurrected like a zombie by a group of Satanists. So continue where you left off, with the detectives in the case again, this time a flying baby is also behind him (do not ask). There have been very good VERY low budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty come to mind), but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel. Horrible acts, special effects from the ten-cent shop, silly comedy intent and oh yeah, and the end stinks too. <br /> <br /> My grade: F <br /> <br /> Sweet eyes: Theresa Bestul gets completely naked; Anne R. Key gets topless
