The director says in the film Behind the scenes that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically, dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a bit of shit for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. PEOPLE WHO CAN ACT. Also, do not release a person who is 40 years old because of the role of an 18-year-old inmate who is misunderstood. That's right, he's been in the institute for 22 years. The reactions that people make when they see how their hearts are ripped from their boyfriends are fun. Or as a part when a boy is stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha) and his girlfriend just says "Oh ... my ... God?" The scarecrow itself is quite a character. Make car turns and call people losers. <br /> <br /> The movie has a redemption factor ... oh, wait, no, no. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely MUST see this Movie, you just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a really twisted song.
