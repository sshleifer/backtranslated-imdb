Although the film takes place in an "Ivy League" university, it was actually filmed in Northern Arizona, mainly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras In the film are then the members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this movie (if you know your Arizona geography) that shows several members of the bike cast from the university to a stream. We, the members of NAU, know that the campus and said creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are separated by about 35 miles, and although the trip is all downhill, it would be literally IMPOSSIBLE to ride a bicycle on that same road.
