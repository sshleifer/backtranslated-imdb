I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fan of the Baby Boom generation that grew up stuck to a flickering b / w image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's Bilko courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would have liked Steve Martin's farce if I had not seen or heard of Phil Silvers. I do not know, maybe I would have. <br /> <br /> Some of the other people who think about this movie are worthy of a '10' admit that they have not seen the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If after watching Ernie's original film, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, he still thinks that Steve Martin's film is above a '2' . half liter....
