This movie is exactly what you get when you really surpass your abilities, it's like someone who just passed the driving test and then faces them in a Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can not add it, the US Grand Prix. to unreliable tires and you may win), that's how short this movie is. Now do not take it the wrong way, I love B-Movies, almost half of my collection is made of B-Movies, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> The first thing in the story (for a B-Movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to make a B-Movie brand, we do not talk about the potential of Friday the 13th, but nevertheless, the potential . But what really disappoints this movie is the performance, in a second I do not think anything, it's like watching QVC, except that the presenters in QVC tend to have a more intense tan. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would like to say that I have seen worse movies, but I can not.
