Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who is obviously trying to direct. "A walk on the moon" seems to have been taken from other better created films. The current story takes place in the late 1960s at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock. The screen treatment of Pamela Gray does not have much in her favor, so it is an enigma why Mr. Goldwyn decided to approach this film as his first attempt at direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family is spending time at the resort. We see them arrive at the small bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes alone for the weekend; He works in what appears to be a small appliance family business that repairs televisions, mostly. In a few days, the first man will walk in space, so the emotion is evident. <br /> <br /> The women of Kantrowitz are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend idle days in the place until the "blouse salesman" arrives. Pearl goes to look and finds much more than a shmatte; She receives the seller too. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life at all. After two children, Pearl, who appears to be sexy and with a high libido, is ready for some extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> That's the basic premise of the movie, which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter, Alison, decides to play the hooky and go to the nearby Woodstock festival, where, horror of the horrors, is Witness how his own mother was kissing with the blouse salesman. What should a girl do? Well, stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties get together happily next to the bed of the little son when the wasps sting and the seller comes to apply some home remedy, and call dad from the city, after knowing the betrayal of Pearl with the young stallion. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she went to do "Infidelity" later, which is the exclusive version of this failure. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female clients by whispering little things in his ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cuckold husband, does not have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebel Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unfortunate Nana, who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first-hand one playing in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch Run at your own risk, or put the DVD on TV when you have a fun audience at home and really want to laugh, or two or more in the movie.
