The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90s. The second one was just as fun with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering that Kevin would have been 17 years old in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? Take a child just as annoying and make him sick. The child is about 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of team of burgers are these idiots? I really do not want to go into detail if you want to watch this movie with sadness. But please, I recommend that you stay away from it. It is not worth your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, do homework, balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap! It's better to do than see "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
