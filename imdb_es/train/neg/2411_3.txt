Hood of the Living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in Oklahoma City, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then, one night, Rick's brother is shot by a gang who was driving down the street and who fought with him before. Desperate, Rick calls his fellow scientist to bring him the latest formula that they have been working on and that brings health to the diseased cells. The formula has not been tested on a human, not even on a corpse, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is dragged only to come back to life and delight in human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the entire hood is transformed into a dead neighborhood. Hood of the living Dead is a piece of garbage. The plot is a direct Resident Evil scam, the acting is just horrible, especially with Rick's fake cry for his brother, the weapons are so fake because every time the gun is fired it sends sparks, and the makeup is just lame. It's just fake blood covered over the actors' faces. The zombies are also modified. They run, they growl, and they must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only fight, moan and be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible, the shots is the only good moment of this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low budget festival.
