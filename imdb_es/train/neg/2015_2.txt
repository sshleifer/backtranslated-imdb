I really expected this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I'm crazy about aviation and I have a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes the fantasy to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only helicopter that went faster and faster was the experimental AH56A Lockheed in the 1960s. It reached more than 300 and was a composite helicopter, which means it had a thrust propeller at the end of its fuselage that provides thrust. <br /> <br /> In summary, no helicopter can fly much more than 275 due to the principle of rotation. wing flight And Bell 222, the "actor" who played Airwolf was not very fast even by helicopter standards. And it did not stay in production for a long time. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that came out during this period of time called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
