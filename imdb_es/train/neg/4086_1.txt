I came to this movie with great expectations. I knew the work of Greenaway and 'The Tempest' and I was interested in an adaptation. First I wanted to turn off after ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but where in your mind do you conceive a small child urinating on a toy boat? Is it symbolic of what? I continued another ten minutes, moving my finger on the "off" button, somewhere something could catch my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. There is a time and a place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and that was the end. Then I read all the comments on this website and the claim of the film only matches its defendants. 'It's a painting ... then you put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ... keep it on stage then'. Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays were made for mass audiences, they were accessible, and this version helps create a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population, and I do not think the Bardo is happy with that.
