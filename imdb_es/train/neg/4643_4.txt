I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the film would not live up to what it promised me in the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts pretty well, with the premise that tobacco films are broadcast by cable. However, the main character does not have anything about her that makes you feel bad about her at all, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are too many unanswered questions. There was a big scene at the end that took me by surprise, but overall it's a very bad movie, but I think it was worth the rent of $ 3.99.
