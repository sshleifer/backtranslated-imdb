When you go to an outdoor cinema under the Greek summer night, you usually do not care what the movie is! Edison started really well with a good effort from the singers who want to be actors and again, a great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In a movie there is usually a good start to get audience, done, a bit boring However, the story fills half of the film that deals more about the characters and less about the action, and the third part is really good so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite policemen (full of weapons that can demolish a building) shoot a guy behind a car, not hit him once while killing everyone (minus 3) and then the man pulls out a flamethrower (to kill the rest 3), you realize that the Greek summer The sky full of stars is too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
