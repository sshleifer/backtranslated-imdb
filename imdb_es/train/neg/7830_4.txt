So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the sense of innovative narratives or real threats, but at least it was well directed, suspenseful and visually interesting, with a solid performance by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini -series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story of the series was terrible, and not in the right way. The script is bad, it requires that the superficial, unpleasant protagonists act in an illogical way to move the plot, and they have characters wandering incessantly for the purposes of a clumsy and unnecessary exhibition. The acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newly married couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative scary, but with the acting and writing of fans, the final result looks like a first-year film school project, with camera movements for its own sake, and little in the form of the plot. or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be disappointed. I look forward to the delivery of William H. Macy, and I hope you get a decent director and screenwriter for your segment. So far, the quality is too inconsistent to predict in any way.
