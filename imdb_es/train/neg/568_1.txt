He "debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I have no words". I recorded it today so I can see it tonight after work. I had high hopes, now I am destroying the wardrobes looking for a rope to hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie", but this movie does not give me anything to work with. I know that spoilers should not be published here without prior notice, but anyway I'm going to "This movie sucks" There I said it! They should show this film to the film students to show them what they should NOT do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or the soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C clamp on my old toolbox. I'll put it on the thumb of my left hand and squeeze it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just record this VHS but I think I'll burn it in the fire pit. I could wash myself with soap, but I'm afraid I'll never be clean again. Christmas is coming Buy this movie and give it to the people you hate. -Micro
