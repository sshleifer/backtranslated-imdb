If you are attracted to an absolutely easy, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilization youth, then this is the ideal movie. Very poorly written, with an often inaudible dialogue and an exasperatingly exhausting handheld camera in everything, this is a film that presents the world in mannequin terms in a very simplistic way: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) ) are insensitive and, at best, clumsy, and predatory monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a lot of primal cries (yawns) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the forest, with utopia taking the form of a rave party, again, in the Woods (naturally ...). It shows all the weaknesses of a first movie, and many more.
