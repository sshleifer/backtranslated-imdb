It is impossible for me to objectively consider this film. It's not that I have not tried, of course, but I feel, and I open the aged VHS, I see the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and I cling to my own Care Bear and watch the movie with my eyes open and An anxious heart <br /> <br /> I can see, objectively, that this movie is a combination of BIZARRE of adorable baby merchandising-pets and creepy pre-pubescent children with evil powers that have a thin history and uninteresting animation. But my five-year-old girl says: "Yes! Careful, bears!" Every time I think about it So, alone (cautiously and reluctantly) I recommend this film to those who saw it during their youth and can resort to the amazing power of nostalgia while they see it (as to me) or to those incredibly Cynics Gen-X / Y-ers who deliberately look for the wonderfully bad / strange (a category in which this movie ... definitely belongs). For those who really look for a compelling movie or a healthy family entertainment: you may want to keep looking.
