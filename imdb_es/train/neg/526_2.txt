Almost as tedious to watch as to read, Evening is a superbly produced flop ... until Meryl Streep comes in and shows her other cast members how to act on this kind of thing. Vanessa Redgrave is surprisingly off, as Ann and Claire Danes, moribund, are a number. Maybe if Vanessa and Claire had changed roles, we could have seen the vitality in the young Ann that had given her entrance to the rarefied world of history and we could have imagined that Ann, the oldest, was dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would soften the narrative, but unfortunately. It gave me a headache.
