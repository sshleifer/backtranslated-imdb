I did not expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Festival this weekend. It was an alternative option when two other films were sold. Even so, I kept hope. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. the boy falls in love with an Indian beauty, a paternal conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with some good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood girlfriend" had none of that. The performance seemed forced and I went to the numbers. The characters were so clich√© that the story seemed to have been written by a freshman high school student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed as if there was an excess of dialogue dubbing. I mean a lot. I know it's sometimes necessary, but it sounded like half the movie was filmed in a closet and distracted. <br /> <br /> Two stars are somewhat generous.
