It is rumored that when the NASA Technical Advisors were asked for this film to keep the image believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work on the shuttle, you will not enter the shuttle. Also, Space (Cadet) Camp is in Alabama, not Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win lottery prizes of billions of dollars before the events described in this film are possible. This film was directed to children, and should have been written by one, because they do not know the innumerable restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all. Time, and it was a well-deserved flop.
