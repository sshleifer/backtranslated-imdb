That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour. He could not help falling asleep. I had been talking about how execrable it was and finally I repented and played, having run out of adjectives to "bore". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want, the pinnacle of hacking work. Something so uninspired, so terribly terrible, that all you want to do after seeing it is to sit alone in the dark and not talk to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie can be seen. It is not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would only recommend this to someone to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. You do not believe me Grouping. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a nation, in the United States we do not always portray the peoples of the Middle East with good taste. But how about a boy in a sheikh costume bowing before a stack of bottles of Castrol motor oil? You will find that here. GET IT? THE OIL OF THE ARAB WORDERS. I could not believe what I was seeing. Having the child flying planes in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to hit who received the payment for writing that bit in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of five men who sing called "Landmines" takes the stage at the official dance. It's okay, are you ready? The joke is that they sing terribly and out of place. Why did I write that in capital letters too? Because the joke is LIBRA, LIBRA, IS IN YOUR HEAD with a marathon of gorillas HORRENDAS. They start quite mediocre; break of glasses, break of perforated glasses ... then there is, I am 100% serious, a sequence of two stop-motion frames of SHOES OF A WOMAN LEAVING. You read that correctly: the music was so bad, in a painting, the woman's feet have shoes on. In the next, the shoes are out! Get it, because the music was so bad that his shoes fell off! What the F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless montage of footage to highlight the fact that SING IS BAD. If any human being really suffered this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be surprised. Honestly, this movie is like a joke to see how fast people would run. Robert Downey Sr. directs comedy in the way his son behaves respectfully by staying drug free. Bad. Other things to keep in mind: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music was always fitted whenever possible. Every time Liceman appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song sounds. In addition, all the actors do their best to act as if it's really cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. The criminal accent of Barbara Bach. It sounds like he's trying to talk like a baby while he throws a marble around his tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes in which the boys complain and twist at a glance of their cleavage, as if they were in an acting class at a community school and have been directed to act like retarded and excited people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his disgusting dog with a condom. Remember; When this movie came out launching "abortion" and "condom" it was seen as "avant-garde". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a spicy pedophile and hungry for children, when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were the same. Totally embarrassing <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the end. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. That is really the end. Tell me that does not make you want to exploit all those who have ever made a movie, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. It has been known that Up The Academy makes other movies, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less fun by simply placing the video tape near them.
