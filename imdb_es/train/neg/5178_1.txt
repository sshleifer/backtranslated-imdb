I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people on this horrible and very bad "horror" movie. Do not waste time or money on this movie, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've found and the script was horrible. Nothing was good, you end up thinking to yourself why I'm watching this shit. The plot had so many holes and it never cleared up in the end, it was so bad, I do not know how a terrible movie could be made. As I said before, I love horror movies and I felt so disillusioned, it was an 18, but you see little blood and do not scare or jump at all. Also, what bothered me was how stupid it happened in the movie that did not make any sense to the plot like the brother and sister who kiss, why? It is all I can say. Just do not bother, there are many more horror movies, but do not waste your time. Life is too short.
