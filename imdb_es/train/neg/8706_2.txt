If this is the first time you experience the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen a "Movie in Motion" before, you will think that this film is the daughter of the gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney the Dinosaur, then you will not be too impressed by this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinosaurs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I like movies B. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before watching this movement, and I liked that movie a lot more. It works like a B movie. It has a more relaxed dialogue, a more hokier performance, cheesier effects and a real Gila monster like a monster! Carno 3 simply does not have a lot of B movie punch. It has some blood, and that kind of Polchek is about to be fun a few times, but this movie is disappointing, almost ... flaccid. It is the small engine that could not of the dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can see the gum drying on a sidewalk and they feel entertained. If you're one of those people, then give this movie a try.
