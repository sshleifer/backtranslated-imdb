This movie has some fatal flaws, so it's amazing that anyone can walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical center. So, this same person just walks around the premises and enters the Dr.'s office, it's just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very very very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made, except that it was filmed in Canada and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless I'm really bored and there's nothing else to see on TV, then I'd say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it's a movie that no actor would want on his resume.
