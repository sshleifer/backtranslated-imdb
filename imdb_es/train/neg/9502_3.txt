This movie was strange, completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while they drank in a big empty house. I really love the opening things with Lisa wandering lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic place in Europe, although maybe not in a low budget horror movie. Definitely get the ending where are the strange non-sexual sex scenes that were deleted (on my DVD copy anyway). Do not try to understand it, just go and watch the strange bits ... that's all. Do not look at this if you really want plot or characterization or something at all to make sense. Pretty beautiful, although you can give up on this and decide to watch a real horror movie, such as Dead Alive.
