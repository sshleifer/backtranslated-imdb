Here, Stella Stevens received indications from someone in disguise (it did not take me long to guess who she was) in Old Nevada Town, outside of Las Vegas, for a money heist at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads his group of three girls, and they discover that they must act much faster than they had anticipated. Despite some pretty looks at Las Vegas in the 70s, a very average but believable performance from the most involved, and a plot with potential, Las Vegas Lady puts a big boring egg. It seems like an eternity for the movie to get going, and when it does, it just sizzles here and there and never accelerates. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Sure, I did not expect anything good, but at least I thought that this could be one of those exploitation films of the 70s or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies There is a tight confrontation between Stuart Whitman and George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as the prosecutor Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The shooting has all the suspense of seeing a waterfall. There is a blow and a head hit with a blunt instrument. Beyond that, nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, do not expect much there either. Stella and her daughters (both with very mediocre but beautiful talent, they enter a sauna and a bathroom.) What do we see? Nothing but a fleeting lateral profile.Stella wears these beautiful open blouses that accentuate her true talents, but I wish it had been A little more open with his performance, that way I could write one thing that I would recommend the film, unfortunately, it was not like that, and I have little to say in favor of this movie, it's not a horrible movie in any way. Nothing in his favor. YAWN.
