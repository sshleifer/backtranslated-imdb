"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things in its favor. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of a musical M-G-M complete with second-level stars. I imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it could finally propel her to the status of an important musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Ellen's opportunity did not pay off. <br /> <br /> Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling through the horrible dialogue for the next boring tune, this movie seems very hard and hard. sloppy. The predictable erroneous identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, CÃ©sar Romero (who is way above in his role as Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally lost in a role of nothing) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars (and she should not be as she could not sing and she even had a "dance stop in several of her photos." But when she danced, it was simply fascinating. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
