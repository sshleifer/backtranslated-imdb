In general, I do not worry too much about the violence in the movies, or about a lot of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good with me and the film brings us much of the above. There are beautiful images especially of the lake and nature, a good scenario of characters, a good direction. This movie could be voted as a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and these two reasons in relation make this movie simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, violence against living beings is used to make this film. No film violence, I'm talking about REAL violence. This violence alone might perhaps be justified if not, and that is the number two reason; The message of the film was not a mere introspection about the twisted relationships of directors towards women. Not that we all have some real twists with women (men respectively). But the conclusion of the movie ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies, (by my own hand, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it infuriated me, now the guy came out with a new movie that I'm certainly not what I will see) and now it is even more clearly represented as a kind of natural demon, nature grows on her, in particular her sex. Of course, it is the director who "kills" the female heroine. Women have to die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion. ** Final spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well, all of that would possibly be fine if the director had maintained his point of view for himself. But use large images, artistic cruelty of living creatures, only to say that men can be scared of women, and men are cruel to women. That's not enough. I knew that when I saw this film I would get good reviews for the "philosophical, oriental and artistic" and any approach. But for me this movie is totally broken.
