If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> Candidate psychiatrist James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and is excited and eager to "change the world". <br /> <br /> From the beginning of The Movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but James believes that it can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty well based, you know all the time that there is a truth in what patients are saying about some bad resident, and you wonder when and how James will discover this. Also, when recess comes, James is somehow persecuted by evil, and you feel some suspense until "the fight" ends. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful and innocent girlfriend who arrives at the worst possible moment and other standard horror items, and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> The formation of the character is quite good, they present you to most of the people who are killed, some of them "you know them". <br /> <br /> The movie sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done pretty well. There are mysteries that are revealed, in an acceptable manner. <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very credible, the story of an anxious student who starts working is good in this context. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Special stupid effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from outer space" - bad guy (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad performances (or probably very few shots when filming) - The main characters sometimes act badly, and sometimes well. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking that "I could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the movie.
