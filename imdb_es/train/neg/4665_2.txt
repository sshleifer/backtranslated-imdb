I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. An intriguing story, schematics of interesting characters, Ewan Macgregor in the absolutely glorious as a whole. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway fell in love so much with presenting the film in a unique way, and not for the benefit of the film. I'm not even going to go into the abysmal performance of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You distract from the story with 4 billion windows and calligraphies that appear at the bottom of the screen and show the lyrics of the music being played. It seems that he lost sight of the presentation of the real story and the development of the plot, and became entangled with fake ornaments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in large, bright letters. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a victim of the author's ego, rather than what it might have been: disturbingly and horribly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In the hands of Greenaway, it is better to relegate him to fine arts classes that are also taken too seriously.
