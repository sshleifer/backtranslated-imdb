. . . And that's a bad thing, because at least if this had been a Troma movie, I would have had senseless violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandonment that could have increased my qualification a bit. <br /> <br /> So, what? Instead, we have a very docile budget (classified PG), barely warm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown). Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -wannabe with humor almost exclusively flat, little of the logic that made Gremlins work so well, fantasy logic or not, without suspense, without sense of adventure, and without violence or nudity to compensate . <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure some of the problems with the movie are inherent in the script. Let's face it, nobody could tell these jokes to be fun. It seems that the biggest fault has to fall into the lap of the director, Bettina Hirsch. In more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> After all, it starts like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) meet in Peru at an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a crazy archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, you think you see evidence of laser cutting in old stone. Then they are in Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they meet with a secret camera. In the interior they quickly find the animal that later they call "Arnold", one of the titular sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Arnold is taken to his home in his small California desert town. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go to a colleague's conference, and plans to tell the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely beautiful girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in charge of Arnold, but since they have not seen each other in a long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while jumping into the sack. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother, Cecil (also played by Korman in a double role), owner of a successful snack company, is eager to buy the house and land of Simon; they are adjacent to yours. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil finds a plan to rob Arnold. Things gradually get out of control, and the picadillos, which have a bad streak with their cravings for junk food, begin to invade the city. <br /> <br /> That is better read in a summary than in the one on the screen. The best shots of the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, like when the characters drive on the outskirts of the desert city. The interiors, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look like decorated, poorly decorated and, more importantly, tend to show that Hirsch is not very good at blocking and configuring shots. Interestingly, given the paucity of production design in general, Cecil's house is a jewel, imbued with the style of the 80s to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was a fun counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he's out of the movie so fast. <br /> <br /> In any case, Korman is a funny actor, but he is much better here as Simon than as Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up absent from most of the movie. Cecil, who is physically distinguished by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the "evil capitalist" of the film, but is one of the classic, ignorant and jaw-dropping characters of Korman. That was one of his specialties, frequently capitalized on "Carol". Burnett Show "(1967) parodies Unlike" The Carol Burnett Show ", which used to be successful because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the scenes to the edge of chaos, Hirsch makes Korman enter Korman too far, and Cecil's character just does not work the way it should. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems related to the director, among which are the rhythm and editing, which eliminate by complete any possible suspense or dramatic impact of the film.Even the scenes that should have been complements to improve the drama, as when the munchies harass an old woman on the road, clump too clumsily to have much effect. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical problems with the story as it is .. Where did the munchie come from on the camera in Machu Picchu? The movie trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it was edited of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike the gremlins, there is no clear reason for fools to go from being the adorable and lovable monsters. Just past. Also, because Munchies remained PG, and the violence is still subdued, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatening. They are also sent easily, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> It is true that the essence of the film is not suspense, horror, drama or any of those other things, but humor. It is thought more like a parody of Gremlins and the innumerable scams in its path. The only problem with that is that the movie is not funny, although I chuckled a couple of times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are bland clich√©s. Too much of the rest of the material consists of non-sequencers. Given the bad moment of Hirsch, everything is over. There was a potential to make a film that, while it was a parody, was fun and terrifying, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspense, all at the same time, from Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). Pity, then, that Munchies does not come close to that.
