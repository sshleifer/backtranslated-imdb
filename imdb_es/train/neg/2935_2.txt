['(Rating: 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our blog What to see below for details on our rating system.) <br /><br /> Here is a movie that will make you scratch your own face in an attempt to get the launch of tedium on screen. <br /><br /> You will not wring your hands or roll your eyes or sigh in your popcorn. In fact no. For a movie of * this * avergousidad, only scratching your own face will be enough. <br /><br /> When you start scratching your own face, how should you start! - Start at the bottom. You will need your upper part, with its practical lacrimal ducts, intact for the third act Truly Tear-trembling that can cause you to fall on your knees if by then you have not left the theater completely. <br /><br /> In a season that celebrates Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Golden Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, in any case, a film of this boredom will be welcomed as something anyone could create. * Observe it *, however, it is a much more dangerous company. <br /><br /> Here is our story ... <br /><br /> Sidney Young, the London editor of a fourth-level entertainment / celebrity magazine, is about to see his magazine collapse. He needs a miracle, and what he receives is a phone call from New York City, in the United States. <br /><br /> The editor of Sharp magazine, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says &quot;Come work for me!&quot; With your own employees performing the fax machine outside your apartment / office in the background, saying &quot;Yes&quot; is a no-brainer. <br /><br /> Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing all the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking the Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) homosexuals. <br /><br /> He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the most popular movie star in the industry, when he leaves it at the magazine&#39;s offices during a business lunch. <br /><br /> This is a moment of bad luck for everyone, since, among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes, before waking up with the character of Dunst. <br /><br /> Worst of all, it completely alienates Alison Olsen (played by Kristen Dunst, an intrepid scripting confusion), a colleague assigned to show her the ropes of the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (Of course, we&#39;ve been to a movie before, so we know how this relationship will end, which is why we need intact tear ducts for the third act of the movie). <br /><br /> The problem with The Thing is that the script never repeats, except for the piece of the tear duct game in which True Love prevails. <br /><br /> The editor Harding is supposed to be a son of a bitch who also wants to get rid of all the work. However, the script never falls firmly on one side or the other of this dichotomy, and Bridges lets himself twist and roll in the breeze. <br /><br /> Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young, but every time he approaches her (as he constantly does) she agrees to converse with him, instead of trying to discourage his existence. <br /><br /> The &quot;comedy&quot; of the first scenes is built around a piglet that destroys an expensive hotel room, and then takes the elevator to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. <br /><br /> The hot star Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is &quot;hurt&quot;. The character never shows us * why * he is hurt, however. This is another result of the film&#39;s deathly injured script. <br /><br /> In one hour and fifty minutes, this thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon&#39;s withdrawal from Moscow. It is uninspiring, it is not funny, it can not be exchanged and it is not even profitable. Run away']
