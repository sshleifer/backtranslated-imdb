All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can not release their movie through a conventional distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the exaggeration of the film does not justify the content of the film. The story is absent and could easily be a short one. The performance is poor, but the animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste your time, do not believe the exaggerations! However, if you have the opportunity to watch the movie for free, do it. Then you will not have to spend money. Still, filmmakers do a good job of pushing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. Otherwise, they are marvels of a blow that never took a hit.
