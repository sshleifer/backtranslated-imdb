'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a sequel made for television of the original film of 'The Omen'. Instead of Satan possessing the body of a small child, he possesses the body of a girl adopted by wealthy parents, who is harassed at school and ends up avenging himself against those who mistreat him. The film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and many of the events that occur are simply foolish rather than particularly frightening, and it is hard to believe that this girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround her. I just did not find this movie very exciting or very suspenseful, particularly compared to the original one.
