Contains spoilers The plot of the film can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys are going to hunt in the forest. Two of them with other people are shot in the head without explanation. The last man can stand in the clearing, scream and do anything without being shot. He can walk through an old factory and make evil people get within his reach without difficulty. The villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> That's the whole story, not summarized but in detail. Everything is drawn with a guy standing by ringing a doorbell. We wait with him. General shot of bored kids in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The only shot to follow a female runner could have been redeemable, if we could see her butt or her tits bouncing. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is less than Terminator and it is not because there is so much action. The characters just do not talk. And, then, they do not even have something corny that says 'I'll go back'. If my friend did this over the weekend, I would encourage him, because it is a great feat to discover the camera's controls. Paying money to rent this as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is a bit funny is the extra the director says, how the local police did not realize they were filming and treated them like a random guy walking with a gun. If they had filmed that, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie.
