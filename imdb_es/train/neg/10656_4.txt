What can I say. A film by Kamal Hassan is horrible. He acts very well, but it is a horrible story, along with a horrible direction. In my kind opinion, director Gautham Menon should stop directing. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. Apart from that, one simply can not believe how true those horrendous crimes were. There was no practicality in the movie. Gautham is running out of stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act really well. The villains look very ugly, although his performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that can be seen with the family. You can not sleep watching this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj again did a great job, and that is why I have given this film 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is moving and soothing. Apart from that, great cinematography. In general, this is just a bad movie, bad. Kamal Hassan, I think, should have rejected this movie.
