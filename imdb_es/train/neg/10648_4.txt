The end of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is quite weak. There are some things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends much of the movie wearing flexible sandals. In my opinion, any footwear in Tarzan, either sandals or boots as it is sometimes portrayed, takes away the character, which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Second, the De Benji character, as mentioned in a previous post, completely derails the film as the comic movie. For me, his character is not necessary for the plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, while Weissmuller still cuts a dominant figure like Tarzan, it is clear that he was not in his best shape. Although in his last Jungle Jim movies, his physique had improved somewhat with respect to this film. <br /> <br /> The battle of the octopus is a fantastic idea, but I think it should have been done in a previous Weissmuller movie when it was at its physical peak Likewise, the battle, which takes only 30 seconds at the most, it would be much more exciting if it lasted 90 seconds or 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and his companion. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye, she fails to save this latest Weissmuller movie, a disappointing ending for a great character.
