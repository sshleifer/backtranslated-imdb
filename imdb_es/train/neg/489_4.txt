The acting is good, the women are beautiful and the men are handsome, so if you are looking for smooth and well acted porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you're wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the protagonist of the same name, is often a mystery. She could have told the truth (the truth that is presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth) and her lover would have saved time in prison for a rape she did not commit. Was she protecting her father, who went halfway, so to speak, when he instigated impetuously a malicious demand? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly worried when until now only her art seemed to matter? During the trial, this woman of strong will becomes pap before our eyes. On the contrary, his lover, who begins as a narcissistic imbecile, becomes a selfless hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Naturally, since no good action should go unpunished, we are told that she will never see him again.
