First of all, let me tell you that I am a great believer in Fanpro's things. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a weak point for fanpro things that means that I will overlook things that I would normally consider wrong. <br /> <br /> So in ST: HF. Well, first the good things. Enthusiasm is an important part of making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the different boats seem to be having a good time with their roles. Then the effects are not bad for a home-made effort, with nothing that really makes you shudder. The stories are not so bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough and at least there are arcs of stories in progress. <br /> <br /> But it has many flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all, although obviously they have To copy Star Trek material, set backdrops, music and effects, I do not see any reason why they proceeded to copy virtually any other science fiction musical score ever. done. Everything, from Aliens to Starship Troopers, gives you an orchestral head at one time or another. Similarly, much of the footage comes from other movies, and CGI did it obediently to make it look different. Gray warships, for example, although disguised, are clearly Star Destroyers of Star Wars. And the station is also quite obvious, Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga of Starship Troopers. Similarly, the sound effects of several Star Wars movies appear in space battles between wrestlers, as well as animated over the footage. In one scene, either in the first or second season, I think you even see two TIE fighters fly by during a battle, which does not make your suspension of disbelief favorable. <br /> <br /> The performance varies from reasonable to normal. horribly painful to watch. However, they all improve as the seasons progress, but they expect to grimace on the screen, especially in the first seasons. They have also made some interesting choices of acting. Let's just say that the food replicators in this program seem to be permanently set up for "cake" and leave it that way. <br /> <br /> Makeup effects are generally quite effective in general. But they really should mercilessly beat the person who decided to use the cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than the background use or the "passing" shots. They are a little beyond the realistic. Every time I saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) I kept hoping that the unfortunate soul that was carrying it would take out a gun and announce that "This is a robbery!" In one scene, a "Cardassian" really talks while using one of these. Not only do the lips not move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be slapped hard for that. They could not have brought him a craft knife, for God's sake! There are also some makeup jobs well done, but unintentionally funny, like Herman Munster's resemblance. <br /> <br /> Writing, although coherent, is nothing new. Instead, the script runs as a continuation of DS9, with ships leaving DS12 in several missions. The new enemy, "The Gray" is not very threatening and the line of the plot that involves them is indeed a reworking of the Borg threads. that is, the Starfleet meets the Gray, the Grays are enormously powerful, the Starfleet barely escapes with their lives, then, through technology, they begin to find ways to fight the enemy, etc. All done before with the Borg. <br /> <br /> Another bone of discord is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write "insert technobabble here" in a script. In general, it means an exposition of the last plan to fight the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolytic charges", etc. In other words, a nonsense that tells you they are in the case and that there is a resolution at hand. <Br /> <br /> The words are simply gibberish really. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF complicates it, they include real-world comments on this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice like "We need to regroup" sounds good, but not when pronounced by a trio of characters that are already part of a group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to respond "We count three battleships." Did I really need to count them? Let's go! He expected the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" or "Can you double check". But my favorite comment of all time is this: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish a bidirectional communication?" <br /> <br /> Communications Officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all of the above, the show improves as it progresses. Stations 1 and 2 are quite bad, 3 shows an improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it begins to improve noticeably. Season 6 so far seems reasonable enough. Although I have a problem with the choice of media for the shows. Quicktime sucks, frankly, and the sooner they move to divx / avi format, the better. Some of us like to take our downloaded programs and see them on a decent-sized screen and not look at a small QT window on a computer monitor. Quicktime not only makes this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution that the programs are in does not scale well. In fact, it makes programs quite difficult to see, as if they were a tenth generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was include a high-resolution downloadable option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is promising, and I'm even starting to like some of the characters. But those are 40 episodes, so I'm not sure that says a lot about the development of the character. <br /> <br /> But, what can you say? It's free ... <br /> <br /> PS: Of the 28 votes, 19 people rated this program with a 9 or a 10. Hmmmm ... were we watching the same program? Or are you 19 years old all three years old?
