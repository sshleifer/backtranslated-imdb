This movie was not horrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan Toni Collette. I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old boy. The book is great and you can not believe that a child wrote it. Toni Collette interprets the children as guardians, whom you do not know if this child really exists or if you are inventing everything. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but I'll say the movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite good and the performance of Toni Collette was amazing, like Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The movie was a big disappointment in my opinion, I would wait for it to reach the DVD.
