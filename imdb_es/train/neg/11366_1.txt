The first (and only) time I saw "Shadows" was during a Sneakpreview. It had not even been released. I remember there was someone from the directors' staff there, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian film, we had never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he's miles away from everything else. He plays an actor whose star has stopped rising. He is helping to make a film in Belgium called "Shadows". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we realized how many oaths there are. Nothing against the word swears occasionally. However, this was much more than annoying. Every time Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it's natural. However, when someone from the cast, a person who does not speak English uses the word F **** or S ***, he becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost track of how many times he uses the words F and S Everyone was happy to be out of the theater. And we had to give a vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.
