This is at least the third remake of this movie, so if you see it, there is a feeling of deja vu, do not be surprised. All they did was to change the scenario of the story and tell it differently, but the differences are not significant. And there's nothing better because the plot is flawed to begin with. It never works And like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen the film, but the ending does not fit the story. If this movie had finished ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and it would have been very satisfying and would have seemed more valuable to me. But here is the spoiler and in the end the crime pays because the criminal is not caught. I never like this message that results from a movie.
