What do you call a horror story without horror or history? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the movie: I have the feeling that the writers never really decided what is really happening in the movie! Knowing it is different, giving clues to the public and not revealing it completely, but here you have the feeling that the writers do not know it, the characters in the film do not know it and the audience sees that nobody knows. (Do you remember "Cube"? Even that movie knew more about itself). <br /> <br /> I have consumed many horror / gore movies from the 80s and this movie certainly has its roots in those films. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines again and again. The story is not really developing, it's never going anywhere. Acting B is fine in this type of horror movies, but there is not much to act on the script. We do not care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly: without emotion, without chills. <br /> <br /> You only get some commonly used items from the horror movie genre. They show Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters really do not contribute anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum number of crew members. And equipment. Oh yes, the filmmakers used to do that, and more, about 20 years ago! I felt the shared shame of the audience when the movie ended. Very bad really.
