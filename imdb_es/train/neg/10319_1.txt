Unlike many, I do not consider the premise or theme of this program to be the least offensive. His execution, however, is another matter entirely. Like many other B-minus movies, all the decent gags seem to have been spliced ​​in the trailers. For most of the 22 minutes, we sat down with a waning anticipation to any morsel of real humor. Or at least something to prevent one from moving with the remote control or counting the fibers of the carpet. With a couple of exceptions, the acting is horrible; the comical excess of emotion and gesticulation of some cast members might be appropriate for a nightly infomercial, but not a primetime comedy (even a Canadian one). Despite the certainly original cultural angle, I can not help but think that this is mainly a poorly shot by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they had the completely wrong tone and script for the prairies. The final insult is that, apparently, they could not even afford to do location work in a small real city (Why are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would cheat on the outside from the center of Regina? As a proud Canadian, I hope that this will soon disappear, and that the rest of the world, prepared by the CBC publicists, will quickly forget this colossal shame of a sitcom.
