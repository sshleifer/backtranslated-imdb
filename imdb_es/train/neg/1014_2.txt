Timberlake's performance almost made him attack the screen. It was not all bad, I just think that the role of the reporters was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical rap role, the hardest and bad guy in the world. I do not think he smiled a smile in the whole movie, not even when he proposed it to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman practically took the whole movie. He had some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was neither good nor bad, he was just "there". <br /> <br /> In general, it is a Dull movie. bad plot A lot of bad acting or wrong roles for the actors.
