We laugh. This script is so amazing that you can go to sleep at CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a ship captain for 30 years, he could not believe what he saw when he saw the movie. <br /> <br /> During his experience as an officer, once he claimed command of the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / diary and (sorry) on his desk. Of course, this was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing in any boat, whether nuclear or not. Give a simulacrum at that time is just a Hollywood script. When a captain is arrested, he is under arrest, you take all your keys and open the safe where the weapons are stored. This is stored in a matter of minutes in a well protected room. He CAN NOT escape, it's like in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my father also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him urinate in the control room. This is not done, ever. My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made where it was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars for which this film is credited, the rest are bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people were still alive in the Koersk, this film takes on an additional dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
