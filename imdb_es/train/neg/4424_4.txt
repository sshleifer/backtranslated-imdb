Uh oh! Another gay movie This time he is showing the black side. Bet your last dollar that will have an unhappy ending! But why? With just under half a dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies must end in death or an "additional" ending. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The cable ... man or woman must die or go alone to oblivion. Why, in the name of God, writers, directors and producers should make the public leave the theater feeling depressed? After all, he's supposed to be gay ... not sad. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'sad' movie. A large percentage of homosexual relationships DO last and couples RIDE together towards sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the negative side of gay life and gives the wrong impression of the gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another 'gay' movie! This is bad!
