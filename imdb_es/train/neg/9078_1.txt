Would not it be great if Not Another Teen Movie put an end to all this stupid, meaningless, have more sex than you? In a perfect world, yes. However, this is even worse. This is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating for the dealer. All the jokes are basically college students that expose things that people are probably NOT interested in seeing, however, they are "fun". Devon Sawa, who was really good at Final Destination, is simply bored in this movie. It makes you wonder if he is being mean on purpose. Grade: F
