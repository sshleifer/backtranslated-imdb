I went to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie did not find them. <br /> <br /> I do not care about stories that spread gullibility, remember Reign of Fire? - But I do hope they are internally consistent. This movie jumped from howlers to howlers without stopping to breathe, all interspersed with special effects that were far behind LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A mystic warrior from Korea who changes shape, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealers and appearing as deus ex machina to take out the unfortunate protagonists of his last disaster. A special agent of the FBI that seems to be completely undone of the old Korean folklore due to the excellent "paranormal division" of the Federal Reserve, which until now has not been noticed. The lovers kiss on deserted beaches where one exclaims: "I never wanted this to happen". A reincarnated pair of Koreans who died long ago "died as lovers of the crossed stars". Mystical pendants, hordes of faceless robotic soldiers (who owe a lot to the orcs of Peter Jackson) and a snake that loses so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach, something comes to distract it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is frightening, the act of acting and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me, the culminating moment was at the end, after the final, when the music of the closing credits was: Arirang! This is like when Akira Kurosawa closed "Ran" with a karaoke version of My Way, and let me be clear that I do not compare director Shim with Kurosawa in any way. <br /> <br /> In short, an indulgent self. mediocre collection of clich√©s and non-sequential narratives that can appeal to the melodramatic sense so prevalent in the popular culture of the Koran, but that it should not be worth the price of the ticket for a serious spectator, or even a not so serious spectator. I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters and go directly to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
