Carlos Mencia continually, violently, screaming with hate "B ** ch!" to women is like shouting "N ** ger!" to blacks, except it's worse. Remember, the word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative term that is still associated daily with violence. "B ** ch!" it is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or killed. This guy is perpetuating violence by odiously using the language of violence. It seems that it can be a gay boy trying to cover the woman, so that it sounds like a hetero. And what about all the white Nazi boys in his audience who greet the fascist while his stupid little white women whine at his side, clearly terrified of protesting this wave of hatred of women? Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support freedom of expression for THEY! Come on, Carlos. Do you want women to have freedom of expression to b ** ch-bop you as loudly and violently and with a big mouth as you do, or do you think that "freedom of speech" is only for men to cheat on women?
