This was a great book and the possibilities of a great movie were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely ruined the movie. Hanks is a great actor, no doubt, but lacks the moral and ambivalent characteristics necessary for the main role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. <br /> <br /> Putting Melanie Griffiths, for sweet reasons, is understandable, but once again, she did not describe the depth or the ambivalence, so I need to do it. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of how each decision, even those at the beginning of the production of the film, can create or undo a file.
