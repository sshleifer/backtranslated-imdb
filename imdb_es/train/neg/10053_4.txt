The corpse of a little girl is stripped of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of the missing daughter of a couple. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, he receives a call from his daughter! With the help of a former police officer and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a disorder in the plot, it moves at a very slow pace and is completely irreproachable. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the ending, but I'm not sure it's worth the rest of the movie. Be careful with the English subtitles of the recent R1 version, they are not very accurate.
