Do you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk away? Well, I had a similar feeling when watching this movie. Well, I really chose to go to see Aprile, and I knew Nanni Moretti's taste for becoming the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last installment of her memoirs, I wanted to give Moretti the opportunity. Mother of all the slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to say something. However, at Aprile, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue, so everything you hear for an hour and a half is a sharp tone about how his politics are better, or what peculiarity of popular culture is tickling his fantasy. At the time. He also finds time to get rid of the movies he does not like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely, being in a position like yours, one would think that he would try to make a point about cinema more intelligently than this. By making a suitable film maybe, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that is not completely dominated by your annoying voice. And when he started to take over his newborn baby, he just wanted to go with someone normal, preferably not a film director obsessed with a strange penchant for sticky music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you their life story, give it a slap. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
