And it falls directly into the category of "incredibly bad", that is, a movie that drunken students would rent to get a kick. I was at the science fiction film festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter when this movie premiered. Other reviews will better describe the faecal nature of this film, and I felt very bad for the poor man from the production company who had appeared, obviously to assess the reaction of the audience. What he got was the science fiction equivalent of an audience of drunken students, and after a "serious" anime movie, I think it was "sky blue," the audience was in a bad mood, and then this movie opened and, In a matter of seconds, everyone entered. The room was rolling on the islands. I will point out the worst parts; <br /> <br /> Script: the funniest and worst part of this movie, it extends along a linear and predictable path, leaving aside the occasional bad thoughts. Garbage, but eminently laughable. <br /> <br /> Animation: badly done and altogether, if you can bear monotonous funds and disguises increasingly scarce for the heroine (I know I can!), then be careful. the montage where "transformed" from a Swedish peasant to LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: So, one-dimensional is painful, there is a short background story (with lateral division lines of dialogue) and little light is shown about the real motivation behind some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have a captive audience and some drinks out there (try and make sure they are alcohol (to alleviate the pain), then insert this movie on the DVD and buy a mentality of "mysterious science theater 3000." There is no other motivation to see this movie more than to laugh at it, and it does not pretend to be a comedy DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ONLY It could be even more boring to see the solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell, since he can not laugh at ridicule with a friend or two.
