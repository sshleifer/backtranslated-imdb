The actors did a very good job interpreting their roles, particularly the mom. However, as the film progressed, I discovered that I was seeing her more because of her performance and not because I cared about people in the least. And, sometimes, I felt irritated by the irresponsible approach and without parenting intervention that is shown over and over again. The daughter is a superficial slut of 17 years whose main ambition in life is to lie with famous men and become a dancer nyphette (complete with a lot of "tremors"). The son is a boy with low self-esteem who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends, so much so that he throws a drug party at the end of the movie. Both the husband and the wife are bored, but instead of putting energy in their past relationship, they would prefer to look for new partners (although the wife chooses badly, since the man she is "thrown" is gay - OOPS!). I felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and it took a lot of effort to take care of those superficial idiots. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the total banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems false.
