If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I would like to know where the money went. A monkey could do better CGI effects than what was wasted for 3 hours on this horrible piece of junk, although I must admit that the machines and the Martians would have looked really cool in an original Play Station 1 game and in the first games of PC since the mid-90s if a game had ever been made. What baffles me is where the money went? The Pendragon films could have made a great movie with good old models and computer-controlled cameras to the George Lucas around 1975-83, and the actors who really seem to care about what they're doing (or ruin in this case) for almost the same 20 million. This is possibly the worst movie ever made! I would prefer to sit through a repeated projection of Ishtar for 24 hours before watching this movie again. I hated it completely! I step back I say this is the worst movie we HAVE DONE because, unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are movies that are so bad that you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this movie and there is no place in my DVD library for her. I sold it to a man for a dollar. I bet the money for the film was spent on alcohol and other vices for the cast and crew. What a shame the Pendragon films! I want my money back!
