I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've seen in my life (followed by Peter Pan 2 and other sequels like The Lion King 2 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; Since the movie does not have an argument, they try to compensate by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying that jokes are bad, but they make up the majority of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not care how good the original movie was, they only care if the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's horrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
