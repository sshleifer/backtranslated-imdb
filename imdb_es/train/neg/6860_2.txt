Beyond the fact that there are crazy people and there are religious madmen out there. <br /> <br /> The characters basically do not make sense most of the time. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have a real, middle or final start, and nothing is very much explained. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a stint in the army. <br /> <br /> It hooks up to a two-story house that is in very bad condition, with the windows closed. Enter the house, walk and finally write a note that leaves there. This scene becomes nothing, and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is never exactly explained who this house is or where the people have gone, but it gives us the impression that Hazel has probably lived there once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Why? We do not know. Once he arrives in this city, he writes a name and an address he sees on the wall of a bathroom and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat bitch. He sees her for a while and then apparently he does not see her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it is useless and useless. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, although they keep crossing. <br /> <br /> Enoch is the craziest thing you can get. One of their habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk to them in an insulting way. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves the way he does, or why Hazel behaves. while doing so, beyond the fact that Hazel had an overdose of fundamentalist religion, terrifying at the time, through her grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch is later entangled with a man who wears a gorilla suit, and manages to obtain the gorilla. I brought him out and then I ran around him. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is quite hurt and seems to be in constant rage, does some street preaching. It gave me the impression that he was trying to free himself from the falsehoods of the religion that had been inculcated into him. <br /> <br /> He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never do anything special. point, and there is no plot. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hazel succumbs to complete the religious fervor and begins to self-harm. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting for its rarity, but other than that, it has absolutely nothing in its favor. <br /> <br /> The cast does an outstanding job, but this film offers neither a point of view nor a story. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters throwing around the word N from time to time without connection to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
