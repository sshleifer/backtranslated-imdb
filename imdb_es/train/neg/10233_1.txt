When thinking about captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, uninteresting, unsustainable, unattractive, unfathomable and unrecoverable. <br /> <br /> I used to hate those movies from the mid-to-late nineties that were basically Scream scams but these new imitations of Saw are just beginning to make those movies look like the classics. They are still pleased with the same demographic group in which these other films were very successful, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that makes the girls between twelve and fourteen years of age to which they point feel like they are hardcore and modern <br /> <br /> This movie is a load of boring shit! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not joined anything good since 1993! Even so, I was surprised to see that he had something to do with something. THIS was bad! Was anyone surprised when the love interest of the film turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did not someone know when they first saw it? Only someone who has never seen another movie before in his life!
