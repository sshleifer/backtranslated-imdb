The only connection that this film has with horror is that it is terribly uninteresting. I would prefer to prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit down again. Even for a television movie it is flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors conspired to create such a movie of nothing will remain one of the great mysteries of the twentieth century. There is only one scene that is merely worthy of being included in the Omen franchise, and is recorded in slow motion and cut off in advance. If you are tempted to see this, introduce it, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With a little luck, he will fall asleep quickly and the alarm will wake him up once the worst has passed. Namely, this movie.
