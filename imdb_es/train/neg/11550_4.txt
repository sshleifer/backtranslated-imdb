I knew I was going to watch a low-budget movie, but I expected much more from an Alex Cox movie. The performance of the two main men was terrible, especially the white man. The girl should have won an Oscar compared to those two. This movie was full of what I guess would be inside jokes for people in the film industry and other jokes that I really understood and made me laugh out loud, which is weird. Without these moments of loud laughter I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the classics of the 80s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a couple of questions I had after the movie ended. Why did the Mexican boy go to the other boy's house at the beginning? What did your daughter say that she fired 100 people from her last job? Why was she breaking her own things when she was angry at him? I guess I should have gone to the question and answer session after the movie, but I did not want to get up at 10am.
