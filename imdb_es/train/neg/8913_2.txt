When I first connected to the news this morning, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was a little fun for a week or so ... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if you can call it that) have too much time to "play". <br /> <br /> At First, I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have a journalist in the least. She is very unprofessional. She continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform viewers about a certain news report. It is really annoying to the point that I can no longer see it. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves to be a celebrity. Therefore, he instantly becomes a celebrity around the celebrities he is supposed to interview. She is not very professional and she may perceive that her relationship with celebrities is more important than being a legitimately insatiable journalist, and that is all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointingly), this program has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US. UU or something that benefits and / or serves the best interest of the public. They are too focused on sensationalism, of which everything they talk becomes a commercial product. On the other hand, your field reporters are very tolerable ... <br /> <br /> I think "Good Day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it's definitely not for people who really care about the news . <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I really prefer to watch KTLA.) However, sometimes they try hard to be entertained, however, they are still a little bored, well, I'm staying with NBC "Today," ABC's "Good Morning America" ​​is also fine ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not become too serious.
