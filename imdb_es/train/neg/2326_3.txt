Dr. Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend any adult or child to see this, unless they are already furious killers. There is so much filth in this movie that it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, on a background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined something so evil. I rented all the copies I could from the local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. That movie must remain locked in a basement behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. That's where this movie belongs. I suggest that if you want outrageous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go to Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. Those movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you need to see Dr. Mordrid.
