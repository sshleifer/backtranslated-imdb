The mission of the Hauser Killer (John Cusak) is to hit a Middle East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan, which is run by US interests. Hauser pretends to be a producer of the Fair to allow him to reach Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes more annoying. Here it does too much: government, politics, music, war, people generally not accepted by society, and did I mention the "war"? And that's what we have here: a very annoying movie that borders a very bad nightmare that comes alive. I still wonder why I continued with the DVD. Also, there are so many members of the Cusak family in this that John Cusak seems embarrassed by the family that has just been there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> It used to be a John Cusak movie, although a little out of the ordinary, it was, in the end, pretty good. Not here. He believes that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Make that what you want. <br /> <br /> There are too many things in the film accompanied by constant shots, shelling and shouting that you can not really focus or was that the point? Probably. It only takes too long to configure the blow, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. Meanwhile, we have nonsense jokes among everyone in the cast. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: the boy ?? The girl's thing and they needed something to take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they were supposed to be (unconventional and annoying) the performances of Duff and Kingsley were good. But, when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd, at the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet taking a dumpster, I knew that the rest of the show would also go to the tank. I was not wrong. I am sure that some will sing praises to this effort, but if a rose is still a rose with any other name, it is also a disaster ?????????? <br /> <br /> Now remember why I continued with the DVD. I expected the story to somehow level up and save itself. I never did it. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
