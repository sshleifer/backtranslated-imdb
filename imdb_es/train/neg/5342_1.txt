Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are in top form here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm also a big fan of the television series. Their music is great and everyone is so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASMO !!! <br /> <br /> IF IT'S NOT A CLUB FAN, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed correctly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small and passionate S Club fans were not laughing. They thought they could do better. And they did it. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat and ugly one who started a mosh band" should thank his lucky stars that he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. BEWARE OF THIS MOVIE! DO NOT GO TO SEE IT! YOU WILL NOT LAUGH! YOU WILL CRY! 0/10 RJT
