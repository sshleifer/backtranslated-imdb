You. That's all I have to say about this excuse apology for a movie. Chupa Chupa Chupa I mean, what the hell were you thinking? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make other films. The performance was so bad that he did not even manage to entertain at a bad level. The attempt of a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie sucks! Chupa Chupa! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors of a sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> We <br /> <br /> All
