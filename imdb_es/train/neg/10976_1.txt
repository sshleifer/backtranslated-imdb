A terrible movie that is supposed to be independent. I needed some dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This totally miserable movie is about the interactions between the Irish. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie crashed completely. <br /> <br /> Here are too many things that culminate with a little brat running and throwing stones at buses and cars that obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too choppy to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years, while her younger sister is swindled by a suitor. This causes the former sister to turn into a bitter vetch and walk in clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister also becomes bitter but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then, we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes wrong but there seems to be no punishment for the thieves. Perhaps, the punishment should have been in the writers for not creating a cohesive film.
