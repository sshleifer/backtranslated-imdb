The comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be horrified a little when they discover a musical "cut and paste" in the American style: an uncomfortable and forced dialogue with inexplicable numbers of songs and dances. The French accent of Gene Kelly was apparently so poor that a dreadful dubbing job was replaced (as you will recall, the dubbing was performed almost perfectly on Umbrellas). The translation of French (for subtitled versions) also leaves something to be desired, although this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has several moments of self-consciousness that are disconcerting, as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes, well, the combination of tight pants / white boots and strangely weird colors, remind us of an Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note, for example, the suitcase that Maxence took on his departure from Rochefort; This is the same suitcase that Guy took on his departure from Cherbourg. Also, consider the "suitable resolution brunette": Madeleine in Umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect the natural feeling of Umbrellas (except the floating bicycle scene), or who are looking for similar questions deeper and ambiguous endings as in the Umbrella script, should probably pass this once per year. Those looking for a French version of a thin American musical of the 60s will be very happy.
