A bit of funny humor, some that fall ill, some decent acting, others that are quite atrocious. This film is simply unpredictable, and guarantees to entertain 12 year olds more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The children's actors in the movie are simply not funny. When you're doing a family comedy, that's usually a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a funny, and I dare say, human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
