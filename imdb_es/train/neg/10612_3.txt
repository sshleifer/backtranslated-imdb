What a great premise for a movie: place it around a filmmaker with a block of writers who decide to take tango classes! Hey and what better idea assigns the central role to a filmmaker who is interested in tango. My God, I would like to have that ability for genius. Yes, I'm being sarcastic. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this kind of zero potential to make money is made into films. Come on, unless you're a rabid tango fan (I admit they exist judging from the comments) or a member of the Sally Potter fan club (?) There's nothing in this movie that makes you run. The cinema to see it. Even if you like tango, a lot of the film is occupied with meaningless scenes, like a house that is being renovated or a man in a wheelchair going down a road <br /> <br /> Coming soon THE LESSON REVIEW where a failed screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer and writes very sarcastic but very entertaining reviews of the movies he has seen. I gasp in shock when Theo Robertson puts his boots on Hollywood's latest blockbusters, cries sympathetically as he receives another rejection letter from a film company, falls into lust while taking a bath and rubs soap over his well-toned body. THE REVIEW LESSON will soon reach a cinema near you if someone is stupid enough to finance the movie. <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter has no relationship with Harry Potter
