WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop." If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you'll think "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> <br /> Get a star because you can see Hugh Jackman's bare chest. That is the only thing that "Scoop" has in its favor. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogyny, and his fixation on women young enough, at this point, to be his granddaughter, has paralyzed any ability to make films that he may have had at any time. <br /> <br /> The plot looks promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, directs a fluffy-headed student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether an English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is or not the notorious Tarot Murder Card of prostitutes . A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising plot, the film completely lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. It's an amazingly lead and amateur effort for someone who has made even a previous movie, regardless of the dozens. Maybe Allen has had a stroke that has not been reported in the press. <br /> <br /> Much is explained by the fact that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now septuagenarian, has FINALLY allowed a younger man to be the leader. get the girl. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way that the girl does not receive anyone. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene in which Johansson, without any central reason in the film, gets drunk, and seduced, by a more powerful and ancient director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. It's a kind of "slam, bam, I have to go." It has no relation to the plot at all, and cheapens Johansson in the eyes of the viewer. Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director, like Allen, who has sex with the protagonist. Allen has his cake and he also eats it. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She does not know how to command the screen, except that she wears a tight, low cut top. He imitates Allen in a couple of scenes, and that seems strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that your character is written like a doll that can not function without a ghost or an elder. and less than an impressive magician, who tells him what to do each turn. <br /> <br /> He is about half Jackman's age, and he presents himself as a very bland screen presence in his scenes together. <br /> <br /> Members of the audience who are not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and Jackman also deserves better: a script that provides intelligence and agency to the heroine and an actress who can transmit those qualities. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is similarly deceived by the script. Apparently, Allen can not stand that Jackman is so attractive and young, and that's why he does not give Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, it is used simply for its good looks. This is a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in many productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he CAN act. <br /> <br /> Here is the big twist of the plot: Jackman, gentle, charming English Lord, really is a killer. So, even though the movie says it's about letting someone else, apart from Allen, get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man he's been making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice, Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being out of your reach. <br /> <br /> With a passive and aggressive touch, Allen also deprives his heroine of her own presence, killing her character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson at all. only at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> A final note: in my screening, not a single member of the audience laughed at any time during the film. Always a bad signal when a movie is announced as comedy.
