Raising VÃ­ctor Vargas fails terribly in what he tries most to be: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and false. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad direction Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not illuminating his film would give him an authentic feeling. Incorrect! It just gives you a bad feeling. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, it only gives the audience a headache and detracts from what is on the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is very painful false, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the sole purpose of trying to look "trendy" with his friends at Sundance and show how "Nervous" is the filmmaker he is. <br /> <br /> In general, the only lasting impression This movie leaves you with what is a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about taking some writing and direction classes?
