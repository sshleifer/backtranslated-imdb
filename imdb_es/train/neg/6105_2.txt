If you are the type of person that can be taken out of a very bad movie, I recommend this one. If not, stay away. This is a surprisingly cheap movie, and sometimes you may wonder if it is not just a joke that someone is doing. The most positive comment I can make about it is that the responsible people seemed to realize that it was a very low budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here. <br /> <br /> But this is how amateur it gets. His idea of ​​the giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered in beige sheets with what look like garbage cans on their heads. Obviously, it is not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with that disclaimer, you will find yourself shaking your head at the amazing cheese of it all. Or laugh out loud frequently, like I did.
