As noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "Has Have Mail," with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the various versions, this is my least favorite. The problem that I think is that the study was based on the charisma of the stars, which is not enough. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two tracks never gets to boil in this film. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the old but nice bagels. And when the cables are boring, the rest of the movie can only continue. Judy in particular is disappointing. It seems he has no neck! I do not know if she was having problems with pain or something, but it looks like a turtle trying to put its head in its shell, all hunched and all. I could not understand why Van Johnson was so hot. I would have made a bee line for that cute violinist. And Van was not great either. I've always thought of him as a generic Hollywood man and he does not do anything to dispel that image here. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you might like this movie. But there are many more entertaining romantic comedies, and they offer you much more than a morsel of clothing.
