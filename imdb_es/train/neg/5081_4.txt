Was there a single positive for this movie? Critics who knew nothing about video games could detect the errors of the game. No damage received with clearly visible damage to the principle is a prime example. <br /> <br /> And it's possible that I missed something, but is not Super Mario Bros. 3 supposed to be a game I've never played before? Well, if that is the case, and I did not miss anything ... how the character of Fred Savage, and even the girl, already know a lot about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know in their second or third game. <br /> <br /> Beyond the errors of fact and game, there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child was not even so good at playing video games in the images they showed. Many of the children I knew at that time had much more experience. In addition to all this, acting and history are simply mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and lack interest, the 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent and completely dry cliche of a child who almost never speaks due to trauma. It is not that this is not realistic, it is the fact that it had to be included in the film to even begin to form a plot that could exceed even 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value that what is found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you'll like it if it was good or not. They were children playing video games, and the moment you saw them, it is likely that you also had an obsession with the NES. But unless you have loved him as a child, there is nothing that keeps you interested, and very little that prevents you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I did not like it. .
