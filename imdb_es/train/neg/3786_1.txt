This is not really a proper revision since I did not see most of the movie. I stopped looking at him. The movie is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped seeing it. <br /> <br /> Here was the problem: I saw enough to be presented to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. They were all a tedious and despicable psychopath, without attractive personalities, who gave me nothing to look forward to. I did not feel a bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there had been only one person of interest, and I do not mean good or good person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with her. Look at "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In that movie, the character of Gary Oldman is a complete lunatic, but it's very interesting. Al Pacino maybe did a good job on Scarface, but his character just did not hire me.
