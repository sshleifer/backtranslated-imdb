Dialogue: forced, cliché; Acting: hammy, cliché; Argument: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in this "B" trash? Plummer was well established decades before this film was made, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... She must have been desperate. <br /> <br /> All the bad ones have accents of bad. - * bad * bad accent guys! (Especially Plummer! Where did * he learn to do "German"?) And most of them also make fun of the bad guys. The innocent bystanders exaggerate their panic enough to make you laugh. The good man survives, among other things: * a 5 "shooting knife buried to the back of his shoulder - he just takes it out and seconds later he's using the arm without any difficulty; * Marines machine gun fire (I think someone he referred to a .50) in the leg he classifies by tying a bandage around the leg of his pants and, from then on, he barely has a limp; * several fist fights in which he holds multiple blows to the face, in addition to running skull - first in the frame of a door; * a fall, backwards, from what seems to be the third floor, to the pavement, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other insignificant inconvenience. he has exactly 3 smart lines, the rest of the time is so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Ok, not everything is bad, Plummer brings a certain class to his part and, without doubt, is the best actor in this movie, of course, that does not say a lot, p But he can make the villain insensitive without resorting to the ham techniques that most villains use here. Liverse his lines of type "Ve haff vays and meance" with some threat, but he is always aware that he is seeing the villain acting the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a tremendous waste of time. The performance, as it is, is something like the delivery of wooden lines from the 70s and 007 along with Bruce Lee's fake fight scenes, but it's not even as good as Roger Moore's 007 or Bruce's Read. Do not bother yourself
