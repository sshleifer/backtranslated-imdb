The silly, often ridiculous game related to the landing of a spaceship and the resulting havoc that this causes in Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always surprised by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in the "Terms of Love" of 1983 as the son-in-law of Philandering by Shirley MacLaine. As the years went by, Daniels could not get a good and meaty role. Instead, he finds himself in foolish comedies like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> Regarding this image, it fails due to the subject. At least, the television program provoked a variety of situations. In the movie, we have constant slapstick and people who become monsters as the government is frustrated to capture the martian-Martin. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of the failure of the success of the film. On television, Pamela Britton played a silly person trapped in situations with the Martian leaving her perplexed. In the movie version, a blonde bomb like Brown, is about a romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> TV actor Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent, or is he really? <br /> <br /> A big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television program so much.
