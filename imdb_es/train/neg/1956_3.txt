This movie has a redemption feature. In a moment, after a character is attacked by a fairy who held an ax, his brother asks him: "Why is your cock there, Chuck?" After suffering almost an hour of bad movie, this almost made my drink come out through my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are not so bad, but all the kids stink and PJ Soles should feel ashamed of herself for making this movie. History is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates). <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many history points that do not add up. For example, in a scene, the ghosts of young children must concentrate a lot to move a physical object so that they can prove that they exist, a difficult feat, since they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, minutes later, they all pick up branches from the ground and hit the tooth fairy with them. Apparently, sometimes they CAN move the material and sometimes they can not. Go figure. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and guts, though ... some pretty tits. But this does not compensate for the deficiencies. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, go rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, although many other critics do not share my opinion. At least it creates a state of mind.
