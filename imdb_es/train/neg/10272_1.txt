When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... my mom threw it into the pile of movies in the "4 for $ 20" section on Blockbuster. When we got home and we appeared in the movie ... twenty minutes later, we found ourselves turning to each other going "this stinks. I admit that some of the friends' lines in the cafeteria made us smile a little. But come on, at least get some decent actors! Every once in a while, in a movie, if the acting is bad and the film does not move at a very slow pace and it seems really interesting, I can eliminate it and laugh a bit at how they have finished (or less) making their lines. But I can only take a lot. The crying scenes seemed like the actors were having hysterical laughter, there was no answer for their lines ... the amateur does not even come close to acting in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here saying that this movie was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie. It's the most useless thing I've ever had the displeasure to see. DO NOT LOOK OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
