Wonderful cast wasted on worthless scripts. Ten or more adults meet at the summer camp they attended as youth. Could this happen in a million years? It is simply a fantasy, and a boring one. Do they become teenagers again? Do they recreate their jokes, games, good times? You can try it but, ultimately, the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How someone can entertain themselves with this nonsense is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
