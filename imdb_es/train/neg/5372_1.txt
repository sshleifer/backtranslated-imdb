One wonders why this photo was made: the plot as such is totally incredible, if not ridiculous, the characters (experienced solitary versus young policemen, quite fascinated) quite predictable, the end totally murky and impossible to understand (maybe after several sightings) but you should have a masochistic tendency for that, the idea is that you have to read the book to fully understand what it is about and the acting is bad. Was it the basic idea to show that French filmmakers can do as well as Americans in the genre that include "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If so, it is a total failure. However, it was a success (and has a kind of cult status as the first French film serial murderers) and, apparently, is considered a good product to export. Strange.
