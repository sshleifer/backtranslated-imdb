I'm marking this as a "spoiler" just because of some of my comments about the content of the program, not because of the content itself. <br /> <br /> When reading the comments, it is clear that these Republicans somehow tolerate the program. , but I despise it, whereas the democrats seem to enjoy its supposed truthfulness. A reader even (it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events happened or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> But as for the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must really be Bush's hatred. In the episode I saw last, s02e03, it was shown that the show should have been created long before McCain became the favorite for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of additional cabinets. I thought that the series should have been made in Europe or, of course, not in the USA. UU., Because I do not know any home in the US. UU That does not have fitted wardrobes, and most likely in artists' homes. <br /> <br /> While I watch the program, yes, I get tangled up with it, I'm surprised to see what a great desire on the part of writers is to do what they can to embarrass our President. Surely there are problems as most Americans will agree, but that is no reason to be so obnoxious in the public displays that are seen around the world. Maybe the trend has already been marked by this program and this network, so that if IF Obama or Hillary came in, would they continue to produce and transmit the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just one more to comment on the comments of a commenter. If there had been some kind of change in the election in 2000, according to that writer, I was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, illusions on your part. As for the 911 events, I think it was launched when Clinton was the president, and I can not see how if Gore were president, anything would be very different.
