I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts around the world and I just saw this, the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5. It is fascinating to think about what came out of this regular movie and I can not help but admire who has seen the enormous potential of "Columbo" and added all the little details that make it such a wonderful and classic series. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode and the paternalistic British episode). If Columbo had made himself in agreement with the original "pilot", he would not have prolonged himself for a long time, nor would he have been seen and loved all over the world. In this film, Lieutenant Columbo is elegantly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his family assumptions and is quite aggressive. Nor is there anything about the chemistry of the cat and the mouse between Columbo and "the villain". You can see it, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo began.
