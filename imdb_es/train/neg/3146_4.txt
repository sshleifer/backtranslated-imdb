the author of the book, with the same title, should not have let his name be used for this film. If you have read the book, this film takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events of the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have very little in common, except the title and some superficial details. The film adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement. <br /> <br /> for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. the plot not only moves at an incredibly slow pace, but it does not offer anything else while moving slowly (such as character development, for example). Some viewers can entertain themselves with some of the graphic scenes of lesbian love that are found later in the film, but you may also see a special program to see the things they show in them and Isabelle: it is quite tame and unimaginative.
