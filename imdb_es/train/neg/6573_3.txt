I read the comments for this and, while I was not expecting a private bran, Ryan was expecting a movie of some substance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the usual introduction to the story and how the unit came along. in being. But immediately it's 1944 and you're not sure where all of them are. The accents, etc. they are very poor, since this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian American, but they all speak in a very poor version of a Japanese person at Harvard. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 As after 10 minutes I could not see more. The characters were one-dimensional and although most likely they were based on real people, I did not feel anything for them and this left me without worrying about them. Very bad direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. I would avoid and seek better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it deserved a better story. You have the feeling that the director had seen a band of brothers and he thought that was enough to sell his movie. My advice is to avoid and see the band of brothers, aviators of Tuskegee, Glory or any other movie like when the trumpets fade away ...
