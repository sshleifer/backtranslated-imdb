This film is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be the best to promote a film a year before its release and not present a quality film. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a moving moment and the pitiful attempt at a love story, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money in this case.
