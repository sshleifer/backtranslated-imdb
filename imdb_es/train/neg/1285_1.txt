Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was appalled by this disgusting portrait of a man who was nothing more nor less than a cattle thief. Worse, the thread of the whole movie was sex in one way or another, by implication or verbally. To see it, one would think that eighteenth-century Scotland was populated by a group of sexual perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke that acted like the "young" mother at age 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish lake is NOT a commonplace as they portrayed it, but it did give them another opportunity to show how we were sexually motivated. Save money and look at Pinnochio.
