I just saw this horrible thing on television. It goes without saying that it is one of those movies that you watch only to see how much it can get worse. Frankly, I do not know how much lower the bar can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are composed of one lame stereo type after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the MOST. <br /> <br /> I have seen some precious turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list them since this is "Number One". <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way, I saw the movie Vanilla Ice, because it was so bad that it was funny. This ... this ... is NOT so good.
