STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> This second part From the films of Che advances the story until the end of the 60's, where man has now moved his resistance fighters to the hills of South America, surviving without enough food and water and with increasing tension among the group. Everything comes to a head when it crosses the border into Bolivia and government forces intensify their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without the flitting between the time and the places of the last film, the second installment of Soderbergh focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages to be an even more boring experience. And, more pretentiously, the score has drowned, giving the second installment a more unpleasant and artistic air that is so alienating. There is an unyielding air of boredom in the movie that never ceases. You can not criticize Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's impulse in the main role, it's just a pity that somewhere in the production things have taken such a disappointing turn. **
