I just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I have to say that this was a lot of crap. The first 3 American Pies were fun, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you noticed the title of the movie, Beta House, it's about a fraternity. Freshmen, girls and, the most original part of all, falling in love. Of course, the guy who gets away with the girls is Stifler, who, along with his peers, tries to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super false. It is really predictable and the plot is very weak. Both sides of the university struggle to see who gets everything (something like that) To summarize: a horrible performance + a boring script + an incorrect use of the American Pie franchise = a total loss of time! This movie is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucked, there was a lot of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
