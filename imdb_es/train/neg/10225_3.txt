Now I will be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about what I did not like about this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about it too. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The mood was nice. And the performance was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is fatuous, imprecise and deceptive. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am a fourth from India, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he is a black boy. And this is not a racist comment, I swear. The idea of ​​a white, a Hispanic or even a Native American balancing a katana on a roof offends everything the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbued with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai. That Ghost Dog uses his weapons instead of the Katana is also an insult to the sword and the souls that are inside, and where the hell did he get a Katana? It must be one of those replicas, which insults the samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor. Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then murders a man by shooting him in the face through a tap drain. Not only is it a cowardly way to kill an enemy, but it is more of a form of ninjas; Silent assassins there is a group that the samurai deny, but hates nevertheless. <br /> <br /> Then he tries to kill his boss, when he discovers that his boss is an evil one. Do you know what a true Samurai does when he learns that his teacher is bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to show that he would rather die and then lower himself to the level of his master puppy. <br /> <br /> Everything related to the character was a giant contradiction with the real code to which all the samurai adhere: the Bushido. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we have a great photograph, a good atmosphere and a regular performance that covers a plot and a satirical premise (which, unfortunately, is the most important aspect of it), what the it becomes an unsatisfactory general movie, and an insult to everything an honorable bushi (samurai) appreciates. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
