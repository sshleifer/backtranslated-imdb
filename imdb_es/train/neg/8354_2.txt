Any film in which Brooke Shields exceeds a Fonda will be both an anomaly and a horror. Shields is really only bad because she is young, inexperienced and clearly not well directed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because it's bad. I liked it at Ulee's Gold, years later, but Lord up, it's awful here. It's not that nobody else is good. There is not a single performance (outside Henry Fonda's charming cameo) that is even passable. I have never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and guidance, as he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is simply horrible, and the actors can not be criticized for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! The edition and the address are worse than those of pedestrians. The shots are held too long for no dramatic reason, or are cut before the impact of the scene can be made. This image was much worse than I had imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. One bright spot: the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way that even large-screen Imax productions have not done so well. And finally: this is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a couple of adorable father and daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more disgusting romantic relationship between a group of forty-three and a 13 year old character old. It suggests more of the latter than the above, and therefore is quite disturbing.
