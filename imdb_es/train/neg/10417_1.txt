This would have been a great silent movie. The acting is really good, at least in Look Ma, I'm acting very well! in a certain way. <br /> <br /> Everything is HUGE. Each line is professional! All scenes are TREATED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY! <br /> <br /> Above all, I felt like throwing up. However, like any train collision, I could not look away. This dialogue could have worked on stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, messy, trite, and almost all the other stereotyped negative adjectives you can find to describe a really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in large doses. , * you * could * enjoy the movie. Prepare to wait, however. In spite of all that melodrama, this thing surely advances at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script must have sounded very different when the actors involved read it to themselves. It just does not work once they manage to deliver it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB does us a lot of damage, sometimes, when it uses its computer-controlled "weighted score". The curse of the hungry class deserves less than a 1. <br /> <br /> The fiction directed by the characters is great, but when you develop your characters simply pushing them through hoops without a plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution , It is not like this. No development of the character! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not a development of the character. That is a plot plan. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or, at least, look at it in silence. Maybe you have fun with everything the characters do. <br /> <br /> Oh, and congratulations, to show that this is really an artistic film, you see James Woods in all his flagrant "look at me, I am the figurative and literal representation of the vulnerability of the naked man" glory. <br /> <br /> Do not say you were not warned
