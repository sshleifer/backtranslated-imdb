Oh, God, where to start ... bad acting ... characters that you just do not care about ... they're American or British ... they seem to think they're in America, because where else is it? huge forest in the central region ... <br /> <br /> a big fault ... you are driving all night through these woods ... unless you are going around and around you would have been in Scotland the morning next ... when the plaintiff hits the poor tramp because ... <br /> <br /> and their mobiles do not work ... so, what do they ... separate, of course, do it? it's easier to take them out ... so three are going to look for a house that could be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay to "take care" of the unconscious woman ... so, what do they do, in instead of making her feel comfortable? , scare her head, cover her or even take her away from the flowery path, just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yards away ... and all the time they have a caravan can put her in ... < br /> <br /> and in the angels in zeal that are supposed to have wished both the humans who were expelled from heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? Do you embark on sexual relationships with the men you meet? ......... no, they are bitten by big pieces and they tear off their heads ... I think they are missing the point ... <br /> <br /> these are not magnificent angels with sexual deprivation, they are cannabalist vampires ... and as for tom savini who says they are incredibly beautiful ... well, those girls have good body but nothing special in the expensive department. the main role was much prettier than these so-called irresistible sirens ... trash film waste of Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
