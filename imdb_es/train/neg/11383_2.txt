This is a truly horrible "B" movie. It is witty and, often, embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine of "doing show business," is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is no more than an excuse to boost the war effort and highlight some 1942 popular music groups, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group receives approximately three standard minutes, with the exception of the Mills Brothers, who for some reason justified two numbers. Ann Miller can not dance until the last couple of minutes of the movie, and she has little to do other than show herself in the midst of a barrage of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment of the movie. In my opinion, it happened in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing on a train, standing in awkward positions. (In the deep south of the time, the band was segregated in rail cars when traveling). Johnny Hodges looks next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film, the trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance hurries down the hall to the camera and makes an "Uncle Tom", bothering his eyes and shaking his head like Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially for jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is really sad. Some movies go better without being seen.
