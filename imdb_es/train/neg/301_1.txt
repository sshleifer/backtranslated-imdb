This is the worst documentary that has come out of Canada! I'm glad to see that the guys have not made another movie. All they want to do is make a movie and it does not have to be the one they wrote. They continue to change the script to adapt to the person they are launching. I could not leave the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please, never see this movie.
