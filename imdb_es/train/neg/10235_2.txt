The only reason I give it a 2 is that the filmography is so stylized these days, at least it has something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid. It is like so many other forages of the 21st century. The gore is free and simply disgusting. I did not care about any of the characters, but I did not care if some cretin bothered to write this shit: I complained about the money I spent, but my appointment and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater. to see the adventurous and entertaining "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the absolute poop of "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
