A comedy drama of two characters and badly performed is abruptly transformed into a polemic that was not so terrible for the Indians, with terrible special effects, abusive use of nudity and ugly violence. It's as sincere as a politician's handshake, as obvious as the speech of a car salesman, one of the worst movies in the history of the universe. Absolute and absolute dreck.
