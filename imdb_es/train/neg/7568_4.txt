Chan Wook Park is nothing if it is not inventive. I AM A CYBORG BUT IT IS GOOD, it is full of fun little ingenious techniques with some ingenious ideas sprinkled between them. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on an imaginative and joyful story that is a radical departure from his usual and morbid fare. One can hardly be criticized for his ambition or his vision, it is really unexpected, then, to see all of Park's effort added to very little. <br /> <br /> I AM A CYBORG BUT IT IS WELL, it seems amazingly subtracted from itself as it progresses, with the final result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the gags are copious and unconventional humor abounds, but all this fails miserably to create a meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and extravagant and are interpreted with gusto by the cast, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not take care of any of them. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating that maybe Park was slightly exaggerating himself a bit, but still managed to show some of the director's unique flashes and, as a result, of an impressive filmography, he was easily forgiven. None of the assured trust that ordered the JOINT SECURITY AREA or the SYMPTOM FOR MR. Revenge is evident here. I'm a CYBORG, but it's okay, it left me so uncommitted that I caught myself instinctively and got ahead from time to time (more regularly as the movie progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and according to that measure, this probably does not deserve more than a 3. For the sake of time, I'll be generous: 4/10
