Wow, it's ironic, since this movie has been out for a while. I think someone JUST checked it a couple of days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl, for the record. <br /> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me crazy, they were so clich√© and stereotyped. This movie had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. He had too many twists in the plot too. <br /> <br /> There is ONE scene in the film that is worth seeing, however, the scene: "Warm heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl kills the nasty girl in the shower. (Well, they were all really hateful.) But his performance in that scene was excellent. The look on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). It's worth watching the scene, but it's not worth seeing the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and do not see it.
