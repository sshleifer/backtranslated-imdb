Sorry. Someone has to say it. This really is / it was a boring movie. Worthy perhaps, but boring nonetheless. I almost cried with boredom when I saw him. The performance is quite serious, the story is long and predictable, the score and the work of the camera are totally standard and unattractive. It's one of those movies that you can not hate (because it's about disabled people), but I hate that almost everyone does it. It's interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. I guess they are not allowed to be objective either. This was done to win prizes - which I remember doing it properly. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining. I have not seen the work so I can not compare.
