Do not get me wrong, I love action and revenge movies, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including the last "The Mechanik" by Dolph Lundgren, which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and could even be a genius for filming and editing movies. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of using his "genius" skills to make movies intelligently, he uses them without showing up to show and compensate for the lack of substance that your material does not offer. "Man of Fire" is about 2 and a half hours when it really should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott filmed and edited this movie also makes you wonder if he really loves you (The audience) to sit through his movie because his constant camera moves and flashes are really torture for the view and make you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> At a time when the MPAA and the studios have questionable attitudes regarding grades, violence and the making of PG-13 movies. I also suspect that a $ 70 million movie is made of a movie script B with a character that cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a boy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge death of a girl who is not even dead! Imagine, then, why a study will approve a better script due to language or violence ... So it was said ...
