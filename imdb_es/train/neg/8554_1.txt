The film was, in all likelihood, made in the year 1930 and premiered in 1931. I suppose that motion pictures had great difficulty making the transition from the silent era. However, this particular plot of Zane Gray seems to be very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper was probably learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, it is not acceptable. Some of the actors acted well. Unfortunately, the Indians always have a short ending in these early westerns. They were living on earth long before the white man arrived, but according to the twisted story, they had no right to defend themselves.
