CQ could have been good, campy fun. But he commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is extremely slow and the plot is quite confusing and so artificial that it is almost impossible to worry about where it is going. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class by a sensible and sensitive eighth grade student, but this video should have carried a warning label: "CAUTION: Student film, apt to be seen only by the filmmaker's relatives".
