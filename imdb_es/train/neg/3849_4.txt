Debbie Reynolds hits the toes, the tangos and, yes, dances her way through this ordinary thriller that has an atmosphere markedly built in the 30s. Two ladies, reunited when their children commit murder, try to start their lives through a dance school for children in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is plagued by neurosis. Can you imagine this 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nah, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much time on the screen to show her things, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the other role, spinning her heart. This is a purely fake macabre piece, written by a poor Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to organize the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). It's not a swig of honest fun in the whole warm package. * 1/2 of ****
