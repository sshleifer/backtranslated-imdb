What made the Killer Tomatoes fun was that it was done by people without a budget who were only being extravagant for a couple of days ... <br /> <br /> This was something on a budget, but it was not like that. so funny John Astin, of the Adams Fame family, is actually making an effort to be funny, but has the support of boring actors, cheap special effects and light-hearted jokes. <br /> <br /> The plot. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides that he will put a suitor on the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and the "Fuzzy Tomato" similar to Gizmo decide that they will stop him. .. <br /> <br /> No direct sense to the meaningless video ...
