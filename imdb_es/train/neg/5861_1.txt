I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978, when I was a sophomore in high school. I took an appointment to see it. No "I do not have", needless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never collapsed as badly as he deserved after doing this horrible and nasty shit. In fact, unfunny is not a severe enough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You came out feeling that any laughter that might have happened was struck out of you before it could happen. It is not worth seeing for curiosity, or for the fact that it is "so bad, it's good". Not even the gang in MST3K could have made it worth seeing this! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
