I really wanted to like this movie, but I ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is the feeding of a camera of a robot that travels towards a pump and, naturally, is unstable. But then the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even during quiet moments of conversation, to the point of being ridiculous. Have rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was filmed in 16 mm does not help, since the whole film is grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> For all the effort that Bigelow put into precise vehicles and equipment, there are enough obvious mistakes and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A car would not burst into flames after a single shot, and once swallowed would not be extinguished with a small hand-held fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely that he would be able to hit an insurgent running long distance, where the bullet is clearly taking a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I think the bombs were taken to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not in a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - It is claimed that the tanker attack occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The area is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, however, it presents itself as a dangerous veil of dark alleyways and insurgents lurking. Interestingly, James never gets into trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley, thus configuring the attempted kidnapping. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of which, the team of 3 men is always represented by clearing buildings, chasing insurgents, etc. on your own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to watch a dead insurgent hanging by a window to realize that it is not faking? <br /> <br /> There were no shots to establish the viewer which was the size and design of the base or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team had reported to, nor had any other characters developed. These are things that the characters would know, so we should also. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will have problems with the Iraqis who are trying to move forward, that the choice of cereals at home will be overwhelming and that the driver who kidnapped will not wait for him when he leaves the vehicle. br /> <br /> Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. The character of Renner from the beginning has a problematic relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. He is exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is the point? <br /> <br /> If this is really the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it is a regrettable group. Based on the half hour that I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO.
