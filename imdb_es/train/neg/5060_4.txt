This film is a perfect adaptation of the English film Infidelity. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran of Olivier and Malikka, the role of Lane's perfect wife-trap. They have changed the second half of the film to suit the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then the film has all the traces of Infidel, although it could not reach the original. It was a soft and cheap porn of Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future, if the Indian directors plan to remake a film in English, they have to study the viability of the plot with the Indian censors. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors gained undue recognition. In the future, directors should be a little more careful when redoing an Oscar-nominated film. <br /> <br /> All told, this is not a family movie, so take extra precautions while watching it at home with your family.
