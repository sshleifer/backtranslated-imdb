I just sent an email to a friend who is in film school about this movie. Something that should be avoided when making a film: characters that talk nonsense, overrated, convoluted screen monologues that, in the end, are trite and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal attacks are so exaggerated that they really draw attention to the film built like a film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it acting, or is the script bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also incredibly incredible for social realism: he voraciously consumes English canonical literature and the Bible while in high or hangover status and is capable of producing such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how can such an unattractive, dirty and verbally harmful character go to bed with most of the women he meets within minutes of meeting them? (I had to applaud when a chick finally kicked him out, despite his complaints and self-pitying jokes). <br /> <br /> The viewer finds pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. . The imminent death of humanity, in the form of bar codes printed on our foreheads or right hands in a creepy biblical manner, is presented to a character who is so well exposed in his role as guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is overwritten and on top - a melodrama awkwardly imbued with pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is trivial, exaggerated and tedious. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies available with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent and much more interesting excursion to the life of people in a similar social environment. The same goes for "In the war zone." And although the comparison is not even justified, take a look at everything Peter Greenaway does, who handles dialogue, ingenuity and absurd characters and situations with more dexterity.
