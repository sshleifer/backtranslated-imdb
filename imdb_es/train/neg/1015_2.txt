Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie made for television. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, the character of Morgan Freeman talks constantly and says "kitty" when it refers to the girlfriend of the child of NSync. Morgan Freeman calling women "vaginas" is uncomfortable ... What the hell did the people behind this movie think? Too many holes of the plot to imagine combined with the horrible performance, confusing camera angles, a lame script and a cheap background music made this film absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations ... but. .. well ... it really stunk
