Woody Allen has made some of the best comedies in history and I would seriously consider saying that Annie Hall is the best movie in history, but if I really think about it, I will probably think of one or two that are better, but it would be difficult. Of course, she has had some movies that are not quite good, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but she had never had a movie as bad as Melinda and Melinda before. Not so tired and so funny, his films are often witty and funny, but how did this happen? Is he still our good old Woody? The plot goes through four friends who are having dinner together. Two are game writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. It is a young woman who bursts into an unexpected dinner. We never hear the rest because the two written works begin to debate if it would be a better comedy or tragedy. Then we begin to see the two points of view. Both focus on this woman named Melinda, who has problems with drugs and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, she is an old friend of the family who, after trying to commit suicide, decided to appear at the door of the house of her best friends for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida, who runs into dinner after taking 28 pills to sleep. Both go in a wild whirlwind of events that never make sense or fit, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some good performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not fit on their own. They could not sink more than most of the other films this year.
