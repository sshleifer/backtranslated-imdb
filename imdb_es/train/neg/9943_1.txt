The cover (which shows a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it look like a martial arts movie. (Hardly). <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the film is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This film is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like those things, then this movie is not really that bad. However, keep these points in mind: <br /> <br /> There are numerous approaches to the entrails and butts of the actors (one scene even shows all the actors with an erection bulging in their pants). The film is also bathed in screech. Colors like lime, peach and red. From the point of view of a cinematographer, this film is a drag queen! Several scenes present characters standing EXTREMELY close to each other, occasionally touching while conversing. In addition, the hero's cousin likes women, and all the other characters in the film try to kill him. Is there a message here that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I enter the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts get caught in a fight). The scenes of martial arts are brief and without imagination. There are no fancy things here, just your standard moves that you would see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene that may be the first low-speed chase that is filmed in a movie.
