In fact, I had high hopes in this movie, so I took what they gave me with a grain of salt and I hoped for the best. About a third of the way through the movie I just had to give up, just the movie is a mix of things that happen for no apparent reason and everything is unplugged. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas that were thrown together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's David Lynch-esquire, as some would have you believe, it's nowhere near that realm, apart from some trippy images. To say that it is artistic to disguise the fact that there is no plot or apparent story is just a way or to justify why you lost the 1.5 hours in the movie. The performance was good, but that can not save the lack of history. I agree with the previously published comment ... "It's like being in someone else's head ... while they're taking drugs," in other words, nothing makes sense.
