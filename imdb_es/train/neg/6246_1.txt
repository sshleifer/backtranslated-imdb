Touch some interesting points .. But! - Does not show evidence of all the 'exclusive' studies shown. Who are the "friends" and the "small groups of scientists" who collected this data? - What about the whole biography of Al Gore that is happening there? How he liked to play with the cows at the ranch or that his son was hit by a car ... very badly, but ... what does that have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I've seen MANY things better, in much less time, on Discovery Channel ... I really do not understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you've been living under a rock, this "documentary" should not be news to you ... all these are old news ... And all Al Gore is trying to do is get some popularity points. PS I'm not American, so do not even try to say I'm a Bush fan: p
