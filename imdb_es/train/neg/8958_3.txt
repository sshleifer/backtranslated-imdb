I did not like the first movie of "Cube" very much. It was a good idea, but the acting upset and the characters always prevented me from liking it too much. I really did not feel the need to see its sequel, but when I heard that they were doing a third movie that would act as a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well, I thought badly. <br /> <br /> The "Cube Zero" begins well enough by introducing us to the two characters in charge of observing and maintaining the endless labyrinth of traps that plague the people in the Cube. The filmmakers manage to provide a sense of mystery with the establishment of the daily routine of the two men. Several questions are created from him, with respect to the reason why people are sent there and also to the true nature of those who direct the whole operation. All of which is left entirely to the viewer. The performance was a bit weak, but overall, the first half of the movie moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> With the story in motion, one of the two "spectators" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And then he decides to go help a group of trapped people. This is where everything begins to dissolve quickly in a dull cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the people who run the Cube program, we are introduced to the character "Jax". Along with his two subordinates play an important reason why this movie is a failure. To begin with, "Jax" looks and speaks more like a third-rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever-popular "eye" of glass, which only ruins any atmosphere created by the relatively pleasant rhythm of the first half. What's more is that it starts to feel more like a comedy instead of a serious movie. With some incredibly cheesy lines, maybe the scriptwriter got bored and did not care. The performance itself degrades to an even lower level when the former "observer" meets the group in the Cube. All the interaction is painful to see how everything else follows. <br /> <br /> Once again, it fails to impress anything other than the weak characters, dialogue and acting "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those looking for a good horror movie.
