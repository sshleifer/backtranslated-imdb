I chose this title from a friend who had it in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so luckily I did not have to pay it personally. I had a feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I KNOW that a really bad movie is after seeing big ones like Children should not play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures that stopped living and became mixed zombies, and now There really is nothing that baffles me unless it's amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis is bad, but it does not reach that sweet spot of absolute pain in which some films are found. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. To counter this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and a crew whose duty is to fire an antimatter bomb (which the opening describes as "the greatest explosive of all time") to the sun, which through a little of complicated science fiction. the logic will cause the flare to fire at a different angle, leaving the Earth unharmed. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that what I just described to you seems like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with a joint cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely handle that level of mediocrity, thanks to a plot that begins in a simple way, but becomes increasingly absurd as time progresses. <br /> <br /> The crowning achievement of this movie debacle is the addition of a villain character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. Through means that are never explained, sends an evil servant with a shamefully bad haircut to exercise some vague electronic control over the genetic engineering scientist of the space crew, played by the female protagonist Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? Because according to his moronic point of view, he believes that the flare will not happen and that when he does not, he will become fabulously rich because he has nailed his claws in the stock market. In effect, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes incredibly complicated and develops very slowly, while taking advantage of the use of characters who only have vague or useless roles. the history. I could sit here and explain in detail exactly what happens to prove the screenwriter's absolute inability to make a plot that really clicks or attracts his attention, but I'm here writing this review in Microsoft Word and I know for a fact that this would take three pages , and I would only lose interest. But, again, you would probably get the same effect when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is terribly stuck with an extremely poor dialogue. Imagine if everything that ever happened at the Star Trek company was that the characters threw a sci-fi jargon at the other. Yes, I know, they already do, but imagine that's EVERYTHING they did, and they used that jargon to create vague and almost meaningless scenes that do not produce excitement, tension or interest in the viewer at all. <Br /> <br /> This is best exemplified when a character in a Zero-G environment screws a screw into a metal box before crying in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding. The script alludes previously to the character that runs the risk of an explosion, but does not bother to give a solid answer as to why or how this happens, nor why it can not escape. In total, you have an unfortunate cross between the strange and the laughable. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where the dramatic accumulation leads to nothing. The performance of Jack Palance is wasted on a character that only serves to lead the hero (do not ask) through the desert, before being mistreated and killed by a lot of costumes. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our boy hero his last name (while wearing a horrible make-up with bruises that makes it look like someone put a balloon under his eyeball), about which he remained silent before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The child repeats it in a low voice after it expires, giving viewers the impression that the name has some meaning later in the film. Perhaps the grizzled admiral of Charlton Heston knows him and the plot will advance like this once his name is repeated. Something. Anything. <br /> <br /> No. I'm sorry. Any hope you have will be frustrated when this moment turns out to be another of the many pathetic failed attempts to create drama for such a flat and trite character that will always be a stain on Palance's career, as well as those of the rest of the cast. It is equally spoiled. <br /> <br /> Completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending with Schofield piloting the bomb in the center of the sun in an effort to redeem his actions while under the villain's spell, a climax that presents another of the sequences of beautifully made visual effects of the film that, even by the visibly elaborate attention that is placed on them, always manage to make the film look as hard as it really is. The saddest part of this film is the obviously big budget, tragically wasted in a stinking script and a cast of support behind Boyle, Heston and Palance who manage to close the coffin with a pure overacting. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
