I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Debralee Scott appears in the cover pictures, but does not appear in the film. Writing is pretty bad, even for college movies. Obviously, it is very low budget, with a scene in the house of the brotherhood that has an extremely choppy edition. <br /> <br /> The characters are quite typical of university films: shy boy, nerd, soft black boy, tough guys, mustachioed boy, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The outstanding teacher is about what you expect ... a middle-aged boy who easily deviates. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see a flick university, stay away from this one. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
