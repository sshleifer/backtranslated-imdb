Another made for TV scrap! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word movie in its loosest way possible!) I thought that Telly Savalas' career had reached the bottom when he made the voiceover in the video of the Birmingham visit which is shown on Tarrant television in a semi Regularly, but then I forgot that I was involved in this! I tried to insert it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV took my memory and shouted at me! <br /> <br /> I like the little (laughs sarcastically!) in the movie that claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the 1940s, but it's shamelessly a picture of the Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties . Also the steam train in which the Commandos are training shows the logo of JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or the Yugoslav state railways) on the side of the locomotive, even though the manufacturers have tried to turn them off. Why not just shoot in the United Kingdom, if that's where most of the film takes place? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage, and a waste of celluloid!
