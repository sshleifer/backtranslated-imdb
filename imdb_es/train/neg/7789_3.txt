While not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The Dangers of Pauline" is certainly insane. The title could lead him to expect a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in the series of 20 silent episodes of 1914), but that would be better than the 1947 version starring Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of Elvis' movies. Worst of all is that it is not a mixture of these, but it is more like someone recorded segments together of each one so that the thing jumps from one side to the other between the two styles. <br /> <br /> The unit in the production comes from the pairing of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a good combination because both lack even the most basic acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore playing in front of Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Later, Austin would play alongside John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", and the disparity of talent between them would be really painful. In the mid-60s she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, as such, she appeared in a similar series of dangerous situations, imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue suit. When the automotive advertising agency replaced it with the girl "Dodge Fever", someone had the brilliant idea of ​​showing it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The story here begins with Pauline growing up in Baskerville Foundling Home, directed by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. in "Dobie Gillis." George falls in love with her (Pauline, not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted. George goes to look for his fortune and Pauline, of 19 years, obtains a job like tutor of a young prince of the Near East rich in petroleum. When she tries to add the attractive blonde to her harem, she escapes and goes from one danger to another. This includes the African pygmies, a million and a half millionaire who wants to freeze her until her one-year-old grandson is old enough to marry, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is meant to be silly and charming, but it manages only the dumb part. There is a certain effort to incorporate a silent film aspect to the action sequences simulating the subencoding of a camera (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (movies, production design, editing) is depressing in the sixties. Nothing here, not even close to the images of Pearl White tied to a trunk that moves towards a circular saw or tied to a railway waiting for the approaching train. <br /> <br /> So, again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
