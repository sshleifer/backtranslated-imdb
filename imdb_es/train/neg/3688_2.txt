As usual, I went to see this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to finish his film career with this film, as he would succeed. But fortunately or unfortunately the movie was a failure. After this he struck a blow with Chandramukhi. I am waiting impatiently for your next Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I have read the other user's comment about Rajni. I found it interesting since the user is from TN too. Rajni is an actor who acts, I think, from his heart, not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we should appreciate Rajni for his good performance at his age. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I need to complete 10 lines for this comment ... so I wish good luck Rajni ...... .....
