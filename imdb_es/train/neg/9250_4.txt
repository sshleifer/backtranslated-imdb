Disappointing, predictable movie in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from one state to another because she can not maintain relationships or find happiness. In this genre 'Anywhere but here', starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, she provided a better understanding of the relationship between mother and daughter. With better performance too.
