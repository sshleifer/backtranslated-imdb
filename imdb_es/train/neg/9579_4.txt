Here is a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they want it!) Starring Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING LADING OF THE 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who makes a robbery in a bank with her boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). It ends in a prison south of the border led by the sadistic Chief Screw (an oversized Robert Englund on a toupee). She and her beloved poodles hide in a convent of a service station until they are transformed by a freshly fallen meteorite. Dogs become unpleasant drag queen "bitches" and Candy develops a VERY long tongue that speaks and kills and can not control. Bullies looking for stolen loot and other varied inflections add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and does what needs to be done about this movie. You look at her and you see someone very funny during the slapping scenes, very convincing during horror scenes and VERY sexy with various wigs and costumes, including a tight and tight latex outfit ... and you wonder how this actress does not it is. a great star It is very bad that the rest of this cult attempt does not fulfill its promise. <br /> <br /> Blame the director / screenwriter Sciamma, who believes that the extravagant premise alone is enough to keep the laughs ... but their vulgar gags Annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogues do not replace the true sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; The film seems cheap, many bright colors and scenarios are strangely silenced by the muddy photography and the dusty desert places. Luckily for Sciamma, Clarke is in her movie, because only she keeps you watching.
