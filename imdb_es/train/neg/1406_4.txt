This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in a 2004 interview that when he is making films, he wants to make music, and when he is making music, he wants to make films. The best of "Promise me this" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like a music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promise me this" has no argument. I expected this movie with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic, one of my favorite writers, who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise", and to my regret, I only saw two dialogues, which I could identify as they are written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to make his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "Time of the gypsies" and "Black cat, white cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. "Black cat, cat White "was the only script Kusturica said he would not play it in. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica returns to the script, and if he does not, he does not make a good movie, and I think this is the case with" Promise me this. "I should have followed Ranko Bozic's script. <br /> <br />" Promise me this "is advertised as" comedy ", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. style that "Black cat white cat", but they are not so much fun at all.I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know that some people who liked "Prom√©teme esto", find it very positive.
