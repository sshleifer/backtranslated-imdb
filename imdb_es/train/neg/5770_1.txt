If I had to create a film thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. Of ten stars, I would rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's as if High school students met one afternoon with a camera, invented a plot and filmed a movie. It lacks so much artistic value that I prefer to see children who walk through high school than to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, something must be said for the abyssal depths. The "shooting" on the stairs is one of the funniest scenes in history. First, the combatants simply wave the plastic pistols at each other, shaking their arms back and forth to simulate the recoil. The pair actually "dodges" nonexistent bullets from each. No squibs, no sparks, no blanks, just waving spirtypunsted squirtguns around. If you want to see two adult men playing the "actor," spin it someday ... after cleaning the refrigerator, combing the carpet, polishing all the door handles, raking the gravel, straightening the books on the shelf, etc. . .
