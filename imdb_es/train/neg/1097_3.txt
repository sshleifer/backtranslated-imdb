I realize that the US Army UU I was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was amazing. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the punishment battalion of the SS in a novel by Sven Hassell. The writer must be a true enemy of the army. The psychopathic sergeant who was still beating the shit of people belonged to a prison cell, and the worthless black sergeant superior should also have been fired. These men went abroad, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits came from, and an investigation would have taken place. The scene that completely ruined him was electrocution. Farrell, the alleged lawyer in the barracks room, would have had the instructor on a barrel for issuing an illegal order (to torture prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention), royal assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and improper conduct of an officer. In the background, he simply moves away. After this, the discipline brakes to a level of crazy house and the film becomes inatendible. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
