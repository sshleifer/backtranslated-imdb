Describing this movie as trash is unfair. At least taking root through the garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This movie was neither absorbing nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act superbly if given the opportunity, so he undoubtedly had an IRS bill to settle when he accepted this serious script. The story of the mad scientist of 'Hollow Man' has been told before, it has been told better and has been told without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the United Kingdom they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)', which is perhaps the place where they obtained the title for this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, direct script, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
