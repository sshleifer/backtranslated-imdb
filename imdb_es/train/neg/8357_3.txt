Man oh man What a piece of bad quality film! But this is a guilty pleasure of my childhood, although I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border) we had this thing called The G Channel in our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love with the young Brooke Shields and I loved her crazy adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script is almost meaningless, the direction is bad, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialogue that It's so bad that it's good and a nice song by Carole King played in the final credits. Maybe you have to be drugged to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon.
