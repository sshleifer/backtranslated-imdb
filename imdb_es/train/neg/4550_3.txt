My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about the "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those effects fans, but I really thought that superposition was a past practice, mainly from the 60's. So for a while I thought that they could have recorded this movie a long time ago and that It took them forever to cut it and throw it. But as far as I know, they did not have cell phones in the 60's ... <br /> <br /> What I look for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not even care about some inconsistencies. However, in movies like this, bad acting, disbelief, etc. they add up to make a bad movie even worse, that's what happened to me with Celestine's prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was really good, and although I am not in all those spiritual things, I can somehow see that it can be conveyed in a credible way: the movie did not do it. <br /> <br /> There could be only one reason to see this however If you really love corny movies, it will be right for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheese instead of quality, I MUST have rated this film with ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are due to the fact that there are worse movies, like "Critical Mass" (see comments on that - hilarious). Celestine's prophecy is at least entertaining up to a point.
