This movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. A tour bus heading to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving buggies. They drive them out into the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot changes constantly. At one point they seek to kidnap a rich ranchera daughter, and the next, they look for a collectable seal worth 90,000 dollars. The dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
