Gregory Peck's performance was excellent, as expected, and the cinematography is quite impressive even when played directly in a melodramatic "moment". But, the rest of the movie was exaggerated and hard to see, anyway for me. I tried to like it, but I had to move quickly during the last thirty minutes or so. I feel like I lost a couple of good hours. If it had not been for Gregory Peck, it would not have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
