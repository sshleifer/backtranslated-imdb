Not totally out of the wall in a good way, but totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uncomfortable mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. What this amounts to is a meaningless and totally incoherent movie. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if any, is complete "pond scum". I would not even call it strange, more like "total nonsense". This movie will surely disappoint, and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if it does, the pungent smell will persist like rotten fish ......................... ..................................... MERK
