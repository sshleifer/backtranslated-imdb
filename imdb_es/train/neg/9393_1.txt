Really, truly, abysmally, shrill, horrible. But actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) declares himself competent as an actor. He is the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treatment, for five minutes, if you want to probe the depths of the grotesquely transparent special effects, Southern California as "the moon" (again and again and again), and Acting on so inept way that it can be a parody. . . except that it is clear that it is not, there is no humor here, except involuntarily. <br /> <br /> The dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects, and the disguises. . . Well, enough to say. Plot? What plot? Bad boy (good, bad head) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or suspect that it is a parody of the name of the founder of McDonald's, Ray Kroc) and his incredibly inept cannons (which, however, have pistols that never need to be recharged, like Commando Cody, so there are numerous combat clashes). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
