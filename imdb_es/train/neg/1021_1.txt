The movie started strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with his partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott's practice, possibly evil as a bad guy?) Committing robbery and murder. The writing refuses to kill the drug trafficker, who establishes the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well chosen and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> The movie starts to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people may see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will see once thanks to Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake has NO talent and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought that he would make a better show, given that he has been acting with talent for years. Everything he did in this movie was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, it does not automatically translate into being able to act successfully in movies. Even N'Sync fans can not ignore the obvious lack of talent to act. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are some holes in the plot, like the sudden sniper skill of Pollack and the lethal operation of the warehouse machinery. This movie had a lot of promise. Completely disappointing
