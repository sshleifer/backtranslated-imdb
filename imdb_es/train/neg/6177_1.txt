The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a first-rate comedian, in other situations far from the Stooges. He had a defined history for being very funny and intelligent. Moe, Larry and Shemp had really known him or at least him for many years and he liked his work. So what the hell was going on when he joined the troop as the "third puppet"? Obviously, nothing. In most of these shorts from the "late Stooge" era, most of the time, the boys face each other or Joe against the other two, and this is not an accurate Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, each man for himself," to quote Curly from "Restless Knights." One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they try to take advantage of each other or slap each other, when the chips are really low, they stick together and come to mutual aid. Nothing of that happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight when you try to cheat others or be bad and nasty, and not for a comical effect either. One could assume that there was something behind the scenes here, art imitates life. Maybe that's really why Besser did not stay long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
