STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (interpreted by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox policeman who gets results but rolls up his superiors into something rotten. By avoiding the clich√© of his partner who was killed at the beginning of the film, the plot takes a different turn and he is assigned to travel to Mexico, where he has been smuggled to a top secret American super tank with an incredible power of fire and image capabilities, only to be taken hostage, along with the team, by a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This small, boring, economical-looking action movie (even by the standards of the '80s) was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after impressing as Flame-haired villain Mr. Joshua in Lethal Weapon He simply follows the moves with his cardboard character here, nervous and crazy as always (with 'butthorn' as his trademark for the bad guys), but without the material to back it up. Henry Silva has a presence as a villain on the screen, but he is totally wrong here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And the horrible script gives him some really awkward boring lines of dialogue that make his performance look ridiculously wooden. He is just one of a lot of actors from action movie characters, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but do not add anything to the mix. After a boring first half without much exciting action, things recover a bit in the end, but it's too little too late and none of that accomplishes the task of being fun. *
