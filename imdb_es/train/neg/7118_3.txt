I could not tell if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a Hitchcock scam or a tribute to modernized Edgar Allen Poe. These days, someone would have cut a little and it would have been presented as one of those episodes of television anthology of the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that there seems to be a pretty and nasty little story that tries to come out from the rubble of this movie, and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with their talent and material with the one that they have to work. But the director simply did not know how to organize a dramatic scene; the special effects simply did not work; the script telegraphed its plot points so simple that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play German "oompah band" music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; They tried very hard. But this is of interest only as an article of the time. I guess someone very young who had not seen much suspense or horror could be accused of "The Screaming Skull", but someone that age probably would not get most of the money. Subtext or motivation of the plot. ("Mommy, why is that good man trying to scare the scary cat lady with a crooked face?")
