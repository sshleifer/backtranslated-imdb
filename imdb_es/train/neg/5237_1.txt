One of the worst movies of Britain of the 80, if not the worst. <br /> <br /> This tawdry tale of a middle-aged lustful who "seduces" two adolescent bushes who look after children and their false wife has nothing to trade. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it's free This film, puerile, rude and unrealistic, exploits the depths, as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way in which the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely united by such an unconvincing script. No wonder that this was the only work of Andrea Dunbar to come to the screen. Complete and complete garbage in all levels.
