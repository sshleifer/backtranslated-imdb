This movie is an insult to ALL divers. It was stupid. It seemed to have been written by monkeys. The performance was absurd. If this is the opinion that most people have of the Navy, then I cry for our defense. This movie was horrible. I put it under "Voyage to the bottom of the sea" in regards to underwater movies. Gene Hackman must have really needed money to rent this shit. Denzel Washington must have been tall. Little in the plot makes sense. And the end. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think about this garbage. If you have not discovered it yet, I did not like it. And if it were not for all the professional comments, I would not have bothered to post.
