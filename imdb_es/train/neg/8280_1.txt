Seeing this, I noticed mainly ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It is one product placement after another. It is quite obvious how this movie got its funding. The "performance" of Jessica Simpson is laughable. Any Dick should never get a job because he plays the same lame character. The "story" is just a backdrop for this long commercial. I can not believe that this film was considered for its theatrical premiere. The longer you watch this movie, the more you feel embarrassed about everyone involved. The only minor savior is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who have almost no screen time like Jessica's cousin. I'm ashamed to have seen the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this one.
