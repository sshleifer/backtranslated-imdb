I guess a lot of people comment / review their first IMDb film because the movie was spectacular or horrible; I'm writing because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the sequel to "Wargames" ... I thought the original was pretty good considering its time and content, I felt it was worth seeing more than once. In 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this film. The computers, the games, the terror, the excess of military zeal have grown a lot since the moment of the first film, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had the opportunity to put everything in a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film failed on almost every level, but I particularly blame writers and anyone who has had any opinion on the realism of aspects of the game. "The Dead Code" was a 1990 flight simulator with some people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer is combining some 7,000 commands, none of which is affecting what is happening on the screen. Until finally "win" by clicking on a box on the screen with your mouse that releases gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is close to the gas). Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real-life war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Although any child from 5 to 16 years could complete this same task: The government believes that it is a lethal threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expert knowledge in bio-terror" ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry in Bio-Terror. Then, there is a scene of pursuit of a movie with approximately .01% of the budget and emotion of any of the Bourne titles. They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clarify the whole thing ... sometimes they are angry and hardly miss him ... but other times they create opportunities in a masterful way and let him go intentionally to follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would write more ... but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I would prefer to see Broderick and Joshua playing tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
