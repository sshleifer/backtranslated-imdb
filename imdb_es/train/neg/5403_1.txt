I gave this movie a single star just because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula to replicate any organism. In his laboratory (a deteriorated warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies bursts in to steal the formula and the rest of the film is an endless pursuit. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber puppet) is released and begins to clean the emitting. He has the incredible ability to sneak up to 2 or 3 feet of a person without noticing and then biting his head quickly. <br /> <br /> A cast member escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the movie driving aimlessly through the city. She has a superior mental capacity that can not even operate the radio. She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and seems irretrievably lost. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are combats and buildings with firearms (cardboard models) exploding, but only one police car, or the army, or anyone else appears. This activity should be commonplace in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a sequel is not planned.
