LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott Kevin Spacey John Heard Cary Elwes. Roslyn sanchez Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he is the star? I should have known better than to rent the FORCE EDISON. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. What this did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt police force MAGNUM, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to discover them. He is the target of your efforts, or maybe I should say for your horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the bad guys got shot in the forehead and I still had the premeditation to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Simply unpleasant The real hint of how bad this movie is is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the film wearing an unruly beard, which looks like nothing more than a bum. You only know that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.
