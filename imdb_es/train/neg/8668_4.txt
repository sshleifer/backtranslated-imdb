I have never read the Bradbury novel on which this film is based, but from what I have compiled, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and do it). My comments will be based solely on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and I was so excited, but when I finally did, I felt so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well chosen (although Robards and Pryce are good actors, but not here). Apparently, the children actors were only asked to show up, put on the clothes of the characters, say the lines and make the faces. The set and the accessories were cheap and unrealistic. The address was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at how horrible I had to connect online and see who directed it, just to see what kind of work I had done. The edition was cut and pasted and the plot (script) was also that (despite the fact that the author had been involved, irony?). The increase in tension, fear and suspense was so mild that it was not effective when the climax finally arrived. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the comments on this film and I find it hard to believe that people really like that. What hurts most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. He had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the film was so bad from the technical point of view that it distances the brilliance of the story.
