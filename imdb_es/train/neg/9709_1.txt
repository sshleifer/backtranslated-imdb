At 30 seconds of the initial credits, I had the feeling that it was going to be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then, the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decided that to survive this movie, we will have to turn down the volume, create our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But that did not help. Halfway down we turn it off. Now, I've had some very bad movies before, with and without the help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are some movies that I doubt even the Bots can save. Most of the movie that bothered me the most was that hypnotized people made people think they were zombies with rotten green skin. I guess they were all hypnotized in death and then hypnotized to rot. Follow the authentic cult classics of the B movie like "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
