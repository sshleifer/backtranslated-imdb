As said before, the visual effects are impressive. They are awesome Personally I use Blender and graphics like that are not easy at all. But that's all this movie is. Not only the plot is confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be here between man and nature. Later, when they enter the bottomless pit room, Proog explains that "one step out of place and (you're dead)." Here, there is a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, out of nowhere, murders Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a guardian caring for a lost child to a "sick man". He betrays us. This is not only depressing, but it does not matter to us because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. It is not a story about someone, through the struggle, emerging stronger. It is depressing and has no meaning because there is no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light as a great drama does. In my opinion, the film is very underdeveloped in all aspects. However, the graphics are impressive, but a movie is much more than a simple "eye in sight". There is no truth, there is no struggle and a bad surprise ending. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
