Surprisingly, the film has a certain redeeming quality as it nears its end. On the other hand, this movie is very bad and unconvincing, with a small budget, an insultingly badly written script and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's nonsense that with all the money circulating in the Christian circles with which it seems that they can never get enough funds to make a decent movie. I'm not a religious, so I do not really care, but the film makes it a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and make people more interested and curious about reading the Bible, for example. In that sense, these films always seem to be a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really hurts the movie and knocks it down. It makes the film laughable by watching it with its effects and only gives the general movie a campy B movie feel. <br /> <br /> But what is most damaging to this movie is its writing. What just happened in this movie is an insult to intelligence and then I do not even complain about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the film goes is so unlikely and the people in this movie do things so unlikely that they insult their viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated that the movie was like a soap opera sometimes. . It seemed to me that they just had a hard time turning this into a full-length movie and added some dramatic characters and developments just to fill things up. Sometimes I just did not care less. <br /> <br /> Even so, it is necessary to say that the film becomes more solid and firm towards its end, when its history focuses more on its essence. Even so, it is still predictable, but it prevented this movie from being a complete disaster and, as far as this type of films is concerned, there is much worse to see out there, although I do not think this movie wins anyone.
