This film is about a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to train a high school men's basketball team. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the lead role, and does as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better option, but given the apparent budget of the television movie, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we never see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, to say the least, without surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the leading male role. He is the star of the team and also the love interest of Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some funny scenes like the rich old man who runs the athletic program and does not believe that a woman should train sports. This point is mentioned throughout the film, and, needless to say, it is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not subject her team to any unorthodox practice sessions; She does not do anything a male coach would not do. There is a fun secondary plot that involves a tall and not-so-brilliant player who undergoes hypnosis to pass his classes and play as professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. It seems that everyone had a good time making this movie, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such a good actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
