I did not really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (publicity about Satanism, etc., etc.) since the advances of the last movie I saw seemed quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea of ​​a good scare and, honestly, I felt like watching a really good and terrifying movie, not a bad-intentioned religious farce that tries to get cheap thrills by making a girl get dirty every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from the spoilers (!) But it seemed very strange to me that an Atheist, who receives a string of rosaries from a deceased priest, may suddenly end the wounds of Christ (not supposed that are stigmas) be deeply religious? I mean, she goes out with losers, does losing things, behaves like a typical rebel, and here is showing the wounds of Jesus Christ? Let's go! <br /> <br /> Scenes of her crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became quite tedious after seeing her a dozen times. It was neither scary nor scary, just repulsive. However, it became quite painful to watch, those fleeting scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are a Catholic, I definitely do not see this. If you're not, you still do not see it.
