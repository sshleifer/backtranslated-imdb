... and in no way so clean, logical and understandable as shown in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood clichés. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and I have spent 16 years of my life fighting for delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character of the film, I succeeded mainly because of the logic: because I kept thinking again and again to keep the deception away from reality, and to know what was really happening and what was not. In the end, I had great success due to the medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped the madness because I knew before I took the medication the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> Then, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does he cheat with the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual, something really important here), but, for the most part, shows a comforting and tamed view of schizophrenia, which has nothing of clear. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not * a "normal man with a disease", is someone who from the beginning sees and feels things differently to most people: for him, things such as time, space and personalities of people are not solid things. He feels that he can bend, that he can change, that he can mutate and perhaps even disappear. To deal with this, a schizophrenic has a rich and very imaginative inner world that "normal" people do not expect, but are stuck in it because they can not relate to most people, and their world becomes increasingly poor until it ends. in a dead end, deceptive and blank. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is shown in this ridiculous "cure", the movie that is torn apart. It should be violently terrifying. People who are not the main character must seem strange, strange and absurd, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. There should be * really * impressive, weird and weird hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It is not * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look at "Naked Lunch," "Lost Highway," reads P.K. "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik" by Dick, watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on the PC, and you may have a vague idea of ​​how it is . Do not watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with banal situations, clean visual characters and elements, and stupid tricks of the plot. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about the mind of a schizophrenic, its visions and its internal consistency: it is violent, strange, confusing and very, very frightening. <br /> <br /> Once again, schizophrenia is not about Details, it is not a clean and docile trick played for you. Jump in your face and it will not let you go: walls collapse, people become strange hostile creatures, you feel that you go back in time, you're not sure who you think you are, everything you feel. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much more than what is shown in this soap-like melodrama.
