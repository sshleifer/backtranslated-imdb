This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions, but that is confused and unconnected in the execution. <br /> <br /> Garcia plays John Berlin, a Los Angeles forensic detective who has moved to a small town in California at the behest of a friend of his in force there. He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder that leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer in which no one else believes. The known victim is theorized as blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl. to be a witness: in a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite a basically intriguing storyline, in this film there were too many quantum leaps and hollows in the plot in which I asked myself: "how the hell do we end up here?" or "how do we find out about this?' I found it confusing and disjointed, despite the good performance, etc. John Malkovich has a small part towards the end as a F.B.I. The researcher goes to Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
