I'm sorry Fulci fans, but I could not go through this. The soundtrack was almost as annoying as they came, the performance was puerile, the story was done and the address did not exist. <br /> <br /> The massacre honestly looked like a children's movie project. But I've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this! It seems to have been so little funded that they could not afford ... NOTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, nobody who even remotely had an idea of ​​what it was to act. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst festivals I've seen, along with Terror Toons, which is only surpassed by Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I have nothing more to say about it. <br /> <br /> Rate 0.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
