First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old in a Christian Scholl that I attended. Needless to say, it was out of control. Not because it was scary, but because of the content. Cmon ... I was 7 years old. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was corny. That's very bad considering that I was only 7 years old and I remember it. The only thing that still haunts me is that horrible song "I wish we were all ready", where the chorus ends with "... you left behind". I would not suggest seeing this. Probably I will, only for a nostalgic reason. Also, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this movie, however, has to be when everyone "disappears"; empty cars crashing, lawn mowers running alone ... pretty funny.
