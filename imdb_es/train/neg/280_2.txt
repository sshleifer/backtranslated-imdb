God, I was bored with my head while I looked at this pilot. I expected a lot of this, since I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not just "Titanic", I should add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (once again, he also wrote the days strangers of lead ..). But the thing failed miserably to catch my attention at any time of its almost two hours. In all that time, he barely went beyond his two-line synopsis, and it would be very difficult for me to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot of the whole mess of threads that went nowhere. On top of that, I do not think the stunts surpass those of any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is beautiful, of course, but the fact that she only shows a single facial expression in the whole movie (pouting and cranky), also bores me of her "girl with attitude" attitude very soon. You can tell me about this, Mr. Cameron!
