I saw proof of this before the Awards season last year, I did not really know why they had been delivered after the voting ended, but at least, perhaps for exposure, at least, but the movie was a complicated mess. Sure, some parts were fun in a kind of black humor, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not a single person I could connect with, and I think that's where it failed for me. Of course, the plot is something interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if that has not already been mined to the point of uselessness. The whole Calvary feels false, from the lighting, the casting, the script to the horrible visual effects (what is supposed to be intentional, I can say, and everyone else, nobody is laughing with you). Anyway, I hope it goes on sale on DVD, at least, I would not want a project in which many people, obviously, put a lot of effort to go completely unnoticed. But it's gut anyway. Bored gut in that.
