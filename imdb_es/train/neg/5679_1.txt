I was so disturbed by the real images at the beginning of the movie that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up turning off the movie. How someone can give this movie more than a score of 1 baffles me. I know that the intention of the film is to surprise, but that it shows real images of a dog that has been skinned alive (holding back the vomit while I write) - PLEASE! I turned it off after the scene with the decomposing baby. I had my eyes covered most of the time until that moment. It is not surprising that this film has been found in the container of offers in HMV. I really do not have any desire to see any other movie of this person from Uwe. Anyone who has enjoyed this needs therapy. Period.
