"The Brain Machine" will at least put your own brain at full speed trying to discover what it is about. Four subjects of different backgrounds and intelligence levels were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them does not have a known family, it should have been a council, none of them will be lost. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is supervised by a mysterious trail known only as El General, but it seems that it is taking the direction of a Senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good call from the senator. There is also a guard in the shadow in which the camera focuses constantly, who then states that he does not take his address from the General or "The Project". Too bad it was not more effective, it was overcome quite easily before everything went well. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the film is a true treasure of 1970's technology with repeated dial-up phone jacks. room size computers and a teletype machine that will not close. Maybe that was the basis of the alternative title of the film: "Time Warp"; nothing else would make any sense. As for me, I would like to consider a title suggested by Dr. Krisner's assassinated experiment entitled "Group stress project". It applies to both the actors and the viewers of the film. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye right above the head of the General next to the pool when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom microphone is visible above his head for several days. seconds. <br /> <br /> You may want to see this movie if you're a Gerald McRaney fan, could you have ever been so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat unusual role as a cryptic reverend, but do not call him father. For something a little more in your alley, try to put "The Killer Shrews" of 1959 in your hands. That at least does not pretend to be taken so seriously.
