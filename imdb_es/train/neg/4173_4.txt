Man, I must say that when I saw the trailer I was thrilled. Futuristic soldiers, facing bad vampires led by the veterinarian of the genre Michael Ironside ... In space. I mean I did not expect a great art, but it seemed like a classic potential of the B movie. This was undoubtedly a television pilot, reprinted some time later in a movie, after it was not picked up. Okay, I'll start with the movies with few positive points, the action was competent for a movie with a lower budget, and the CGI and the locations used were passable. Now, in the bad, first of all, Michael Ironside was the barley in this, and his performance here ... well, it was not corny in a good way. But like I said, I was not in that anyway, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA group for Vampires, no, I'm not kidding, it's the dumbest and most incredible thing I've seen in a long time, and it's taken seriously. In addition, this film commits one of the main sins of film B, mocks a lesbian scene and does not deliver. The most important of all that sinks this movie is that nothing really happens. As he was destined to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains, they only reach the end. If ever a movie needed to increase the Sleaze and Gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. To finish, I will say that the main team in the spaceship, they were all very capable actors and could very well leave this mess behind them, and continue with bigger and better things. They just did not have anything to work with here.
