I thought that this was a very clumsy and involuntary version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters a certain personality; but everything felt forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have been much more immersive; maybe starting with a shootout, and then blinking for a summary of how they got there or that kind of thing. And I felt that each scene was predictable and routinely signaled, like a very bad telenovela. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see this movie and I expected something much better. The only thing I can say in his favor is that he outperforms Mick Jagger's version, but not much.
