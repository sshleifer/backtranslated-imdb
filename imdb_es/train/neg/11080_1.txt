You have to love the cheesy low budget movies. This comes complete with bad effects, accessories and bad performance (very bad). Also, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister) I keep thinking 'Be careful! She is a vampire! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and who wants to spend money making a movie, how little was spent, of course. I know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the film or the producer who did not recover any money. <br /> <br /> I would say it is good for small children in its simplicity, but I do not know if I would submit it to a child ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because that's the lowest I'll go.
