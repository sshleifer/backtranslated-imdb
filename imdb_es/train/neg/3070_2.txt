Oh, dear sir ... They've turned what was a thought-provoking movie into an amazing testosterone festival. <br /> <br /> The original version of this 1971 film was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a few customers? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that gave us the idea that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably, he had spent his entire life trying to get to the vanishing point. That point is seen in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road meet, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free, and does not mean bad for anyone. We saw several times that, when there were accidents, he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before continuing, even the policemen who were chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his search, he took his own life. Instead of being arrested and living a life of captivity. He died as if he lived, opening wide. <br /> <br /> In the new version, Kowalski has a whole history (including first name, even). He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife has complications for her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband, and the expectant father is excited. He comes to the decision to take his own life after listening to his wife die in childbirth, but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it reached the bulldozers. They even gave him the "super soul" part, the blind DJ (brilliantly played by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
