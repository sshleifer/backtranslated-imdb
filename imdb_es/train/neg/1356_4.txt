First of all, I completely disagree with the user who calls this a "parody". Crispin Glover is very serious with his movie. He personally presented the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He had worked in the film for years and is the first in an intentional trilogy. "What is it?" it is Crispin Glover's attempt to make an art film in the vein of which he idolized Herzog, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I had heard the rumor of this movie for years "epic porn movie with all the cast of Down syndrome led by crunchy pea". When it finally came out, I saw the trailer online, read the synopsis and started foaming at the mouth in advance. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a big disappointment. If he eliminated the foolish fool, like the grandmother who smoked marijuana and the dancing dolls, he would have something much better, but only 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words just watch the trailer, have fun and leave it like this. There are some amazing images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but their lack of focus equals disappointment.
