This is one of the worst movies I've seen to date, the best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard", who tried to act jumping up and down the bar, something like what I wanted to do on the DVD, to save him the rest of humanity the agony of watching this fucking movie. It has a great cast, so you're still waiting for it to go well, I mean, with Sean Astin "Andrew" (he played his role perfectly, he did a great job, what's wrong with this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poeta" (they put their name on the cover, it has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If the cast had done it any dignity, they would go out and buy all copies of this film and burn them together with the writer / director George Hickenlooper and the writer John Enbom
