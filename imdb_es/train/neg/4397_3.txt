One of my sister friends lent me this game, and it's too difficult! It has the appearance of a game for children, but you have to learn to make tons of complex movements that require you to turn and turn your hands in all kinds of uncomfortable positions, and you have to look for endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your 'score' ! You also have to find these incredibly hidden puzzle pieces, which require you to perform almost impossible tasks to get them! And I'm alone until stage three! Maybe if you do not have life and you can stay at home all the time, you could enjoy this, but otherwise stay away! AND DEFINITIVELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN: THEY WILL REMOVE THE HAIR WITHIN THE HOUR!
