Probably, this does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher films, but it is a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of Holiday made it quite interesting, but after the first scenes, the film shows that it is poor. Production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, the subgenre was, right now, all about an invisible maniac, for no apparent reason, but this took it too far. There is absolutely no consistency in the events or anything else to add. <br /> <br /> The clichés are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so is the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty mediocre entry that should not be promoted, even if it has an unpleasant video tag. <br /> <br /> I am really disappointed by this piece of overrated garbage.
