Peeew this sucks! As everyone knows, it's based on some Geico insurance commercials; What nobody knows is WHY? Those ads were fun at first sight at best; Just forage for a series. (The Geico gecko, who speaks, is another story - that would be a fascinating series!) And why the hell ABC, as reported in the press, agreed to buy Geico Caveman character rights for this? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen fighting in the modern world is not exclusive to television; Phil Hartman had a recurring role on Saturday Night Live as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer more than a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works better, like an occasional delivery. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A series from the 1960s called "It's About Time" also used cavemen in the concept of the modern world - it lasted a while). <br /> <br /> One of the directors of the series, who was also responsible for the commercials of Geico, was recently quoted as saying: "We were very excited when we were filming our commercials because we felt we had something that was unique and that we had more important stories to tell. " Incorrect. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad television, this is meant to take its place next to "I and the Chimp" of 1972 as one of the worst of all time. The main actor in the embarrassing fiasco of the chimpanzees hid from shame by association after it was abruptly canceled. No doubt our caveman friends will follow his example.
