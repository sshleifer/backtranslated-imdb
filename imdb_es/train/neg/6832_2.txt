I would have liked this movie, but Van Damme does the same old and old trash over and over again. Poo panties fight scenes as usual. The only thing that this loser left aside was that the Russians usually end up being killed in the end. This movie is a dog game of the highest nature, please, please, please, Van Damme, get some acting lessons, you need them. Anyone who likes Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way Van Damme gets any acting work is when he writes the film, produces the film and makes the screen for the film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND YOUR RECEIVED BLACK PULA. I give this movie two out of ten, because Sandman's was better. To add insult to the injury, I wasted a pound on this manure.
