I will not spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive that I felt I had to let people know that not everyone is so excited, much less intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but they could not contain the rest. I felt as if I had been drugged for the first time, having semi-philosophical conversations with other teenagers. <br /> <br /> What useless attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I prefer to see Jesus is in Palestine, without all pretensions and with direct humor, also asking questions about life and the realities that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard O Tarkovsky and apparently never will be.
