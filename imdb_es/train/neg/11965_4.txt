As a crazy woman in history who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed in the movie. Of course, the costumes and the staging were quite authentic, but the Hollywood representation of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of film images dedicated to the troops marching or parading should not be unprecedented. In the history of cinema. Every time I listened to the beginning of triumphant background music, I knew that I had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless stuffing. Obviously, the producers had invested a lot in the "staging" and were determined to obtain the value of their money. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was, again, boring and their characters never developed. Every time Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I was disappointed. His lines were so weak and meaningless that he could hardly believe that they were the same two great actors who played Lawrence of Arabia and the Birdman of Alcatraz, respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this is not much better
