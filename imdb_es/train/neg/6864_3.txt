There is a little spoiler underneath, which could ruin the surprise of the unexpected and truly amusing scene of ONE in this movie. There is also information about the first movie in this series. <br /> <br /> I captured this movie on DVD, which someone gave to my roommate. It came as a set along with the first movie of the series "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This movie was certainly much worse than the first one, "The Night of the Blind Terror". In addition, many of the characteristics of the first film were changed significantly. To begin with, the film was dubbed in English (the first one was subtitled), which I tend to distract. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in atrocious and secret rituals. Upon discovering these crimes, the local peasantry killed the Templars in such a way that their eyes can no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from hell to avenge themselves. Then we jump to modern times where, due to some event, the Templars rise from the dead to take revenge on the villagers whose ancestors ruined them in the first place. Of course, because undead knights do not have eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some kind of noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secret order, from about the 12th century, that emerged from the Crusades. They only existed for around 150 years, before the Pope and other people suppressed them in the early 1300s. Because they were reserved, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, particularly for initiation. Also, because of the way society was organized, church officials did not necessarily supervise things, which meant that they did not have an inner man when things got hot. And, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured to make confessions. The order was stronger in France, but it existed in Portugal and Spain, where films are made. <br /> <br /> Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights who drank the blood directly from the body of the virgin (here, of course, this is a horror movie), and then, once the knights they come back to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; In this sequel, all this disappears. You still have the same scene (remade, not the same image) of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood in a container and drink it from that. Therefore, when they return, they simply attack people with their swords or kill them, what I have to say is that it is a much less effective means to annoy their audience. There is also a problem of time: in the first film, the appointments are much closer to the Templars, where here they are now saying that it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants who burn these guys at the stake, which they would date around 1473. And that's how Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting too. In the first, the crows sting. Now they are simply burned, and in a pretty ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, and maybe it was just me, but it seemed like a lot of people from the first movie reappeared in this movie (despite having died). It is not really a problem, since the film is completely different and it is not a sequel in the sense of a continuation, but it is something strange. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich one a Child uses to distract the undead while he takes a break for the jeep. The boy's father had already been tricked by this rich man to make an attempt to get the jeep, so he goes out and tells him to look for his father. It comes from nothing, and it's easily the funniest scene in the movie. Of course, the reason why the child does not die right now surpasses me and is disappointed by horror fans. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it becomes fun, so it ends up being a mediocre horror movie. Most of the film has several people hiding in a church, each making several attempts to go alone to escape the blind dead around them. When the movie ends, you are not surprised by the result at all; in fact, quite disappointed. If you're in the novelty of watching a Spanish horror movie, watch the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and not-so-expected results.
