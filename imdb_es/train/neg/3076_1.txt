This movie should not be seen unless you try to kill yourself. I think this movie could cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the whining non-hero Kevin, Amy, his spoiled and impious conservative girlfriend, Kyle, an idiot in red shorts who enjoys sex on the phone, Daphne, a squalid horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" and She has no sense of how to dress, and her boyfriend of overexposure Nick, an army recruit who can make a suggestion of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, so it's REALLY how the movie is going. The movie itself is a scam of the Gremlins of 1986, but you'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it. Finally, they end up in a strip club, where the biggest dream of Amy's nerd is revealed. She wants to be a stripper! Look, I saw this movie through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot making a laugh out of this cinematic train and it still made me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I'm not going to give you more plot, because reviving it gives me this great need to drive a fork through my brain. Also, it is not as if there was a plot worth mentioning. They should put a general warning of the surgeon in this movie.
