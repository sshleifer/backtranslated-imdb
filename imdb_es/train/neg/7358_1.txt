This Lifetime-style movie takes the victim of the divorced middle age who finally fights gender at new depths of absurdity similar to cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here, the ex-wife of something like that of a successful lawyer. (her daughter from college) is starting a new life after her divorce, with the help of a friend from the university to open a new clothing store as a kind of franchise expansion agreement. He has even started a friendship with his attractive landscaper / gardener (who is black). But then the horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, ANOTHER thing that she assumed as a tenant to let a room through, begins to "take over" her life. <br /> <br /> What this new threat from younger woman really does flirts slightly with the gardener, and offer her a glass of wine that * pant * really belongs to the divorcee. She raises utility bills by not lowering the thermostat! And back down the toilet! And leave the old food! Bad in the refrigerator! And hang your (African) art pieces in the living room! And so on. Well, she may have killed the cat too. Yes, it's fine, the extent to which it does these things is bad enough, but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially because it becomes a campaign. The reality of the character is that a small part of this would drive this particular prose crazy (so, why did she rent the room and to the horror of the horrors?), A much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Supposedly this increasingly arrogant woman (natch) has a mania for taking control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight against this evil (and erotically attractive, of course) 20 something. But there's a problem. Every time something starts to cause problems, she uses her POWER, and simply flirts or has sex with a guy and escapes the consequences. (Well, actually there's something in that ability to be well seen, twenty-somethings, it's just not * usually * used in this way). <br /> <br /> The premise is moved along by the El 20 device. Something convinced the divorcee to formalize her room rental contract with a written lease contract produced by her. Of course, 40 something does not know about these things, and 20 something has had help. Actually, the lease gives the younger woman the same right to the entire house during the rental period, with public services at a fixed price. Even though an eviction process is pending soon, the 20 something soon receives a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening something to 20. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all that is bad about sexy and young Finally, the "heroic" battle of the 40 for LA CASA begins then. Woopie! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horribly easy it is for the TRO (or protection orders) for women to climb into nothingness that she does not show, although they are usually just it's easy against men. Sometimes they are as unjustified and as motivated to take control of a house as it is here. In fact, brides who have moved with their boyfriends can often evict them from their homes or condominiums without any proof, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing their version. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to refute the threat claims (prove to be negative), when the burden of proof actually falls on the accused, rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of US law where this is true, and it is a sign of outrage at the excess of feminist participation, and the fact that an organized group has not resisted the steamroller). Of course, it is not likely to be the subject of any The movie of all life in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this film is based on the explanation that something 20 is psychotic and is not taking its medicine. Even so, it does not make sense. She is not behind the successful ex-husband lawyer, although she does help him with the fury of his ex-wife in his search. She is behind LA CASA (technically, to expel the divorcee from her during the period of the lease). This second youngest woman is after EVERYTHING that is LEFT after the divorce, after the affairs with other 20 and so many, LET her husband! (The ex-husband seems detached and basically solicitous after his adventure, it does not matter, he still deviates!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough to look for his age. But his point of view, attitude and approach is so small, disheveled and completely without imagination or vital force that it is impossible to worry about it. Well, I guess a core group of lifelong amateurs care, judging by the average score given by the small number of qualifiers. (I kept seeing him only because he was extremely bad and cartoonish that he had a camp appeal.) I could not resist seeing how far they would take him.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (If such a thing is possible with this movie). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a clue. The film ends with something that is rescued from prison by promising to "listen" to her male partner and, sometimes, her lover, and "do whatever he says" and "let her take care of her" (she means to follow her taking his medicine) - and then trick him and return to THE HOUSE. There, she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonically stalking her nemesis of something, who is bathing in the candlelight, certain that the younger woman is out of his life. There is a fight, and the mother of 40 earns something, by hitting something of 20 with a hypodermic needle filled with antipsychotic medicine she had found. Then she begins to caress her, like Mom, and the two women have a moment of feminine and binding solidarity! How sweet.
