This is the worst, and I'm referring to the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can talk to the computer like a real person. Probably think that it must be a super cool high-tech computer, well, it is, but it also does it with another very poor and weak computer that does not even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> and The main idea of ​​how to overload the "super" computer by connecting to it through a computer game on the network is really stupid. My mobile phone will turn off the lighting to preserve power, but apparently this great computer can not decide whether to use its resources to face threats to national security or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> There are also other problems. But I do not have time for this. <br /> <br /> I just can not believe that someone can record a movie as stupid as this
