Woohoo! This movie is really horrible. I can not imagine how anyone could have read this misspelled script and gave it the green light. The cast is uniformly of the second level with some truly horrendous performances of virtually the entire cast. History is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The narrative, plumb and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humor. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny that became increasingly difficult to bear as the film progressed. When its advantage (Carrell) is unpleasant and unattractive, it is uphill from there. Despite its false ending, where love triumphs over lust, I was left with a feeling of discomfort in my stomach. If this is what happens through humor and social commentary, then we are definitely condemned.
