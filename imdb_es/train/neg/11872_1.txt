The only way this is a family drama is if the parents explain everything wrong with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year and then they kill him for eating his food after killing his mother and at the beginning pontificating about the responsibility of his actions. They blame bears and deer for "misbehaving" while eating, while not taking responsibility for using proper locks and fences, or even learning to shoot instead of mutilating the animals and letting them stay.
