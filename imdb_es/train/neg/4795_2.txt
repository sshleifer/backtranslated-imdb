It seems that this is the only film that John Saxon directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's boring and wooden, and there's not much that gets it. A Viet Nam war hero takes a job for a mafia boss, becomes too friendly with his wife, and then his wife is killed by the mafia boss himself and the war hero framed and sent to prison, especially on the death row. Now, this prison in particular has been experimenting with prisoners and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then all these infected people are trapped in prison, some of which are becoming zombies and others who suddenly do not want to be there anymore. This goes on and on and on with nothing particularly to show or say for itself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to come several times but no, apparently it was only ready to take off on a different and equally boring Way. If you watch until the end, they may turn themselves into zombies, so do not take chances. 2 out of 10
