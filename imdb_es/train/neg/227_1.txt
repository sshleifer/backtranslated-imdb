Was this supposed to be a serious comedy or drama? This movie begins with a cheerful joke between three women. Penalty fee. It gets into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Penalty fee. There are some pranks between them. Penalty fee. But when the plot gets complicated and eventually turns black, I started to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. Continue in this direction for a while until, in the end, try to return to the original jokes. But by now it is too late. It is hard to see why these women would still be talking to each other and the ending is not convincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make movies. It's hard to see how the producers convinced themselves that this movie would work. And the box office showed that it was a real failure, because I had never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after its release).
