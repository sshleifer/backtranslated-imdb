This movie was definitely the worst movie I've seen in my entire life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like the way this movie was filmed. all the actors are unknown, and it seems that a group of friends met and decided to film their own movie. But it is absolutely horrible. I have never seen a movie worse. The story is so false, and I just discovered that it took me a long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it seemed that it was not planned before they started filming. The story is very rare I did not like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. There was no point in even filming this movie. If you are considering watching this movie, do not do it. You are losing your time.
