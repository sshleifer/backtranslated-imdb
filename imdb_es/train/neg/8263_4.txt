'Mojo' is a story from the fifties in London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique to film the 1950s that is often seen in movies that emphasizes the physical differences of our time, but also represents dialogue in a very exaggerated way (due in large part to the way the speech it was represented in the films made in that period); I have no idea if people really talked like that outside the cinema, but no film made today and set in contemporary times uses such a stylized language. It is as if the forced discourse of the writers of the 1950s served as a common shorthand for a past that, in consequence, seems a very distant country; and, therefore, emphasizes the particular, more than the universal, in history. 'Mojo' presents a strong performance by Ian Hart and annoying Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting 'career; but it feels like a piece of the time, a modern movie, incomprehensibly structured in an old-fashioned language. Pretty boring, actually.
