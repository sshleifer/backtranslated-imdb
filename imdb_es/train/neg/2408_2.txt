This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that animates the dead again. First he uses it on his brother when he is shot to death on a disk. His brother then infects the other members of the gang. In some scenes you see the zombies walking very slowly and in other scenes they run very fast, which does not make much sense. The acting is mediocre but the story does not help the film. The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this movie I'm sure was very limited. I think the film could have been made better if the story had been more original and with a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie movie, do not see it.
