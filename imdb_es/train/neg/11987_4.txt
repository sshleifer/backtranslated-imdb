In my lit. class we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie does not look like the book at all. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) I did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother was cheating on his father in a van that was not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man with whom the mother is cheating does not have black hair, she has blond hair. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) A thirteen-year-old boy can not bang his fist through a window with a single blow. <br /> <br /> And for the performance, the child who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the scenario was impressive, although I doubt very much that the director has read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if so, start a letter of complaint to the director.
