It's not even worth seeing that this sticky spoiler ruins everything about "Annie." The characters seem almost downcast by the poorly written plot and have a feeling of poor quality in production. It was very clear for television, but if I found it on my television, I would flip through it directly. The children in the movie do a good job, however, the adult performance is amazing, so the movie really does not appeal to you. This movie lacks the music / dance numbers that make the original brilliant and it really takes on the brightness of Annie. all love. Johnson, as Annie is sometimes annoyed and overworked ... you can not convince her that it really is Annie. The differences in the character's appearance continued to irritate me throughout the film. It is sad to say that this sequel was a total failure.
