An insane scientific girlfriend is beheaded for what turns her head back to life. Honestly this is the plot of the movie. He tries to get you another body searching in the area of ​​the city for that perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly monster in a closet in his cabin. The sordid style of the film is ridiculous. No one in the movie can act including the head. The wardrobe monster is a man with a mask tie and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the end is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this movement. Believe me, folks, I would not see this movie on my own.
