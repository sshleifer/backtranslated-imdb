Actually, I did not care about Geico's commercials the first 50 times, so I saw them and they even seemed a bit ironic and funny, BUT SERIOUSLY! This is the BEST thing these people could invent? This show sucks! It's tasteless and it feels like watching an episode of "The Office" with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know many of you will hate me for saying that, but "The Office" does not do it for me). Okay, I understand: we have the poor bum who tries to keep his nose clean and has a shitty boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really only has an intellect that barely works; and the fool who just wants to be accepted, but ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡AQUEL !!! I've worked with these people and found them as annoying in real life as I do on TV ... why would I want to waste another 1/33 of my week watching more of those nominated guys? Call your parents and ask them if they dropped it on their head if after thinking about it, they still cheat and believe that this is entertainment.
