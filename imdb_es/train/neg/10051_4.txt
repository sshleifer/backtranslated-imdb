I gave this 4 stars because it has many interesting topics that many have already mentioned. From domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos in it. Out of the blood, I would not really call this horror as much as I would science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's bleak, depressing and desperate. While I do not mind a less happy ending, I'm really tired of the clich√© "suck humans" that is fundamental to each film. I know that you can not get a degree in liberal arts today without bowing to the change of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how about as a writer / director we pretend that we are different from everyone else in the package and observe that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN CAREER are evil! Right now, if you are reading this and you think that humanity deserves to die, just go out, look for a lake and nothing until your arms are tired. This way, you will not be around to direct the next movie or write the next book that tells me I deserve to die for being alive. It is silly, not thoughtful, and boring.
