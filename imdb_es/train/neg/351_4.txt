1st Seen 2/16/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery / Thriller with too many ridiculous turns of the plot. Despite the talent of this film, this film is too predictable and simply underestimates the audience. The public that goes to the movies is not stupid and I hope that it does not keep filling certain pockets of stars again and again regardless of what they are involved with. We think this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against the punishment of the capitol at the beginning, but it turns out that it's just a standard, created for the good of the audience, run of the mill, let's never end this, thriller We are caught up in every foolish change of character, as they are presented to us when necessary in the story, and we are ready for this to be over before it ends. Yes, there is a good performance here, especially Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psychoactive support role, but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the long-awaited end.
