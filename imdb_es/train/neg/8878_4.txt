Judy Holliday reached gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of "Born Yesterday," and from that moment forward, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to find gold again. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I can not think of a softer title, by the way), Holliday makes one more variation of the silly blonde who may not be so silly after all, but everything about this movie feels animated. and half a heart Even Jack Lemmon, in what I think was his first film role, can not muster enough energy to animate this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the film will end practically from the beginning, so in general it remains waiting for the film to catch up. <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you're in love with Holliday, you'll enjoy this; otherwise it would not bother me. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
