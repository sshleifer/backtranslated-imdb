I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company is dealing with is trash! First, and this is very important, never look at this sober movie. Why would you do it? Unlike many other entertainingly bad movies, I think this was intentionally bad. I just can not forget how fake the snowman is, so it always shows up briefly, the way he moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the piece of shit of Michael Keaton, since it was made a good movie, and that version is as bad as this one.
