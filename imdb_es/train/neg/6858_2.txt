The Wise Blood of John Huston was a more horrific misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than he could have imagined. From the terribly terrible performances (and not, "Oh, that was done on purpose, you just do not understand" me!) To the most appropriate musical score for an episode of Rockford Files, this movie was disgusting. I saw it without ill will at first, and, in fact, I expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent accent of the south to the comic and comic way in which their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Until the end, which was completely devoid of any feeling of character, it failed in all the places in which O'Connor's book shone and resonated. The actors portraying the "southern" cops may also have been eating choked hot-dogs from the New York City street stops and quoting the Godfather. The only redeeming performance was the living and dead performance of Ned Beatty of Hoover Shoates, a religious swindler who listens to Moates preach the Church of Christ without Christ and sees signs of dollars and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its spooky and religious current that imitates the seemingly lifeless corpse of "Faith." Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, since they are understood by me and by most of his admirers, if I can be so bold as to say it. While I acknowledge that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to wish to remain a fan. If I had seen Wise Blood in the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For the sake of Flannery, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Oblivion ... that will take some time.
