This stifled melodrama is quite easily the worst movie starring Ingrid Bergman I've seen. Even its luminous presence on the screen can not save this film so slow and winding that it is almost impossible to sit without a fast breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Only for Bergman fans; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you look "For whom the bell tolls".
