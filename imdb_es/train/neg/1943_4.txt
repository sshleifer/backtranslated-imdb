What a disappointment! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. It is true that he advanced at the speed of a snail, but nevertheless, I grabbed and kept watching. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good value for money and he, Suranne Jones, was a good leader. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. They tempted us with possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. Everything turned out to be a very small beer and the outcome was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for that? My advice: see dry paint instead.
