The Flock is not really a movie. It is an aspiring film, with aspiring actors. Not including Richard Gere, he had an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors really gives himself to his character, and the rest of the cast is acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this? She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film she looked extremely out of place, out of everything! The only thing he was doing was asking stupid questions, like "Do you really believe?", And making silly faces. I felt embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and I used to like her ... She's the kind of romantic movie, I do not know who chose her among all the actresses ... LOL, and see Avril Lavigne ?! This really made me laugh .. Anyway ... If you want to have the feeling of vomiting, this movie will do the job for you !!! I would like to be able to vote -5 ..
