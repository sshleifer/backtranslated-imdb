It is hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the peak of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best science fiction series in history, being at the peak of glory. Nine years later, he almost forgot, and his attempts to succeed on the big screen failed miserably. I can not even explain why, he is a good actor, but probably his moment of fame gave him an eternal role that requires a great talent to break. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less known, and was very lucky that a movie like 'Playing God' did not take her career to a dead end. Fortunately for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' waited beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft arrived, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> There's not much to tell about this. movie. It's Andy Wilson's only big screen movie, and there must be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what happens on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of a victim of a gunshot in a bar only to find himself working for the mafia. The voice off the screen is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shadow of the film's cinematic experience. You probably do not know the movie, but in DVD rental stores or on television. Try to find something better.
