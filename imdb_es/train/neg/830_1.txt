I really do not understand all these positive comments from users. This movie is the worst I've seen in my life and I do not try to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is sexy but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's their fault, it's the directors' fault. Somehow he has managed to make everything look artificial; his performance, the idea, the makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star that I give is only because of the idea behind the movie, which was very badly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this shit, go see a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
