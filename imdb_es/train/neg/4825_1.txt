Judging by the exaggerations and other reviews on this site, I was ready for an incredible horror movie focused on junkies. What I got was a complete shit centered on drug addicts. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cooks" that these people have reviewed. There are only 3 main characters, and none of them seemed well written or well acted. Basically, the whole movie that I spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or some other decent horror movie. Hell, rent out "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more frightening and more convincing than anything you find in "Cooks."
