urgh! 3 things you need a movie: a good script, a good plot and a good casting. I watched this movie hoping it was hilariously terrible and unfortunately I was disappointed when it was just terrible. I lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that kept me from lifting my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason I saw it in the first place). He did a good job as Rastus and his appearance has not changed much since he was 13 years old. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. The dog was also very good. They both did a great job with such horrible material. Sandra Bernhard, I think it was the biggest mistake of the movie. I was completely wrong, and I think he never got the character. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10, and that's just for Rose.
