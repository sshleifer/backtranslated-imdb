Presented in 1955, THE COBWEB is a stellar cast that ranges from veteran silent screen LILLIAN GISH to the progeny of Actors Studio SUSAN STRASBERG. Located in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this film about you about ... great drama? Relationships doctor and patient? Treatment of shock therapy? No, this howler is about exactly who is going to choose the curtains for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm kidding? You can not believe what you are seeing as you watch this incredible story that became a movie! Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) shrinks progressively and wants all hospital patients to participate in the design, selection and execution of the necessary new curtains. McIver's wife, who played with a marble mouth, GLORIA GRAHAM also wants me to pay her 2 cents in this monumental task. The same goes for the long-time employee Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, one wonders if he really got too involved in the detail because of his marriage to worry about the JUDY GARLAND wart. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted on this Hokey story. What were you thinking?
