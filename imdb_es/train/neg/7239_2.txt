This movie is advertised as an intelligent romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic, and it's definitely not an effective comedy. The fortunes of the well-intentioned but pathetic character, "Tom," range from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only saving grace is the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we glimpse the pleasant face of Paltrow. In general, to avoid!
