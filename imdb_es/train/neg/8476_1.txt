This movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. First, the casting could have been better; Katelyn, the main character, looked nothing like her television mother. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot was pathetic. It was extremely cliche and predictable. The ending was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I'll say about that). <br /> <br /> Although the nail in the bag was a scene in which Katelyn (jordan hinson) was supposed to be crying, but the girl could not cry when ordered! there were no tears running down her face, just a few incredible sobs. She is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same fake giggle identical to that of hillary duff in lizzie Maguire (sp?). that's when the movie went from not so good to just bad. It really seemed like she was acting. <br /> <br /> in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! It was a mix of all the clich√© movies for children of the 1990s that we're all fed up with, only worse! <br /> <br /> I give it an 'F', because it was very hard to feel (b / t / w, I was babysitting when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you may like it if you have 9 or less. ;)
