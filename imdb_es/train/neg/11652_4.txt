['The script for &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; was simply not ready to work. This is a problem with the film that is clearly evident, both for the actors and for the audience. The director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are fun people; And so, the movie is not completely without humor. For your credit, the movie has several fun moments. But as a whole, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; is not even close to being as smart and fun as the original. <br /><br /> The first &quot;scary movie&quot; was a laughing movie by the minute. He turned the smallest subtleties of the genre of slasher movies into comic gold. The humor in &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; is as heavy as it is not original. Even obvious opportunities for parody are lost. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of &quot;Beverly Hills 90210,&quot; and this was a show that asked to be parodied! In the final analysis, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; is like a good bottle of wine that opened too soon. The script needed a lot more time to grow old. 2 stars out of 5']
