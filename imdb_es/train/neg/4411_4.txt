Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he does not have to be the protagonist, except in a low budget movie. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen and, unfortunately, is not really the main character. Most of the time the screen goes to the brick-faced Rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween movies 4 and 5) plays her daughter, and she's cute and entertaining, but it's written that she's not too smart and one of her silly mistakes makes them kill one of the main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. The mere fact of seeing what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare before the Godfather of the local Mafia, and it is difficult to know if he is working or not in the film as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems to be in all the action movies from live to very low budget video. Thomerson is also in some low budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comedians in this film made it look like a parody. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It is difficult to say at some points. There is certainly very little yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is threatening and well launched. Some of these types of movies have thugs who look like they work at the local comic book store or at the Piggly-Wiggly store. In general, this movie is very uneven. In some points it looks like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points it works like a good action movie. Then it spits until the end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this film would get a zero in my humble opinion.
