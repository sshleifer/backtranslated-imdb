Yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you can not stop laughing. I've seen comedies, good comedies, and I laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant that you cheer up the rats, the effects are so bad that you wonder whose art class the elementary school was in charge of, the acting-- oh the performance-- talks about the tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks <br /> <br /> But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we could not see the rat until the end, rather surprised me. Often, the "big" is not shown until the end because the budget is limited and the good effects consume a lot of money. However, I suppose, in this case, the great rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy who was running around disguised as a ladybug with third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After realizing that the rats could not stand the loud noise (migraines from poor performance?), The main guy lights a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. If you've ever wanted to see a couple of rats stand while the blood comes out of their heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Actually, you need to rent it and see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, okay?
