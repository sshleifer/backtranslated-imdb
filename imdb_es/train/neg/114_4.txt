It is not the cast. A finer group of actors, that you could not find. It is not the scenario. The director is in love with New York City, and at the end of the film, we all are! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich has done here. If you're going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There are none. The actors fall in love at first sight, the words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood, that's what happens when they go to work on the set. It is a reality for him and his teammates, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. Then, in the end, the film is hollow, superficial and without messages.
