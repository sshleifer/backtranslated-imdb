Look at the 1936 version. As personally annoyed, I find the voice of Charles Boyer, more a rival to pay Rudolf, depressed and cosmopolitan. I mean Omar Sharif, but not very cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old, she does not look like Marie at all, nothing! She seems too sophisticated to even think about dying out of love for this man in this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film that transmits the role they are playing is Ava Gardner, whose appearance is the Empress Elisabeth. on the screen it is appropriately brief (and look for images of the Empress there is something more than a passing likeness) since historically, Empress Elisabeth was not so involved in the life of Rudolf.
