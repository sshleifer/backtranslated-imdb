A scientist on an island is very sad about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. Then he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark? Well, who does not? It is a bit difficult to deal with the fact that the hammerhead shark that is killing everyone is constantly being called "Paul". In addition, the cast of William Forsythe as a hero of MacGyver-kick-ass-assthththay-day lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot girls that make you look at the screen while the shark Paul bites another. In fact, I find bad movies quite funny. But for my taste, it would have been a much better movie if it had been made for, say, $ 10,000 less. Then it could have been fun.
