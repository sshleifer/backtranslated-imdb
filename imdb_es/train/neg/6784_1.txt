I tried to watch this movie twice, and even then I made a quick advance of the irritating parts, but still I could not get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie * genuinely * received good reviews. I think these people who give such good reviews are just trying to promote the film for marketing purposes. His criticisms seem very unrealistic and it seems like an internal job, which makes things more regrettable. Movies should get real positive comments on their own steam and not invented! <br /> <br /> The performance was reminiscent of a corny porn movie, and not in a funny way. I do not care about low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with them. <br /> <br /> I found that the main character is irritating. His facial expressions and his humor were unbearably childish. I thought that this was intentional to make the conspiracy of women seem more pleasant and well-founded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very uncomfortable (his bosses exaggerated the business speech) and the sarcastic comments were not funny. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything to redeem about this movie, except for some of the attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that a rating was so deceptive. I was interested in his premise but I was scared of everything else. Of course, see it if you wish, but you just did not want anyone else to have any illusions or waste your time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
