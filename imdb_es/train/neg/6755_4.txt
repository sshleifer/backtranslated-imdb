Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she expected when she goes to a pool party with a handsome co-worker. When her date and her friends jokingly claim that they belong to a 'Murder Club', Maddy takes it very seriously and moves to 'Level 3' by hitting a woman's brain in a parking lot (for denting her car !). But is it also Maddy who puts on a plastic mask and kills other members of the group or someone else has lost it? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very ill-conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before an absurd end of turn and outside the left field. Part of the dialogue is frankly laughable. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the cast was atrocious. However, I managed to sit through this fully entertaining Full Moon release. There's a lot of skin and blood and it's the kind of perfect movie to sit with a group of friends and disarm it. Fans of terror can also enjoy the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (like Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
