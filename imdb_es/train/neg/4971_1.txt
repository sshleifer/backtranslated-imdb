I work in a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with a few copies, this is the kind of movies that shows the science fiction channel. The kind of movie that nobody wants, and only the idiots that rent, when they bring it back I ask them "was it good?", They say "no, we turn it off after 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible monsters generated by computer, superimposed and similar, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of movie as Grendel, and an absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonable (and only reasonably) good time based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who is also starring in the expected 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Also, later this year we have another Beowulf movie, with a cast full of stars ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let that make you look forward, as we did with Eragon, or we're all in for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And with regard to rentals, here's my golden rule: if there are only one or two copies, do not rent it because it's a lot of garbage. (This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign, or a documentary.)
