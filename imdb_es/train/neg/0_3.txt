Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. It begins with an opening scene that is an excellent example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience turns into a demented and violent mob because of the crazy songs of their singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd all the time without a general narrative, which makes it too unpleasant. Even those of the time should be off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare look easy for a third grade student. On a technical level, it is better than you might think with a good photograph of the future great Vilms Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
