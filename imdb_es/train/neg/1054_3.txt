['The rural family drama, perhaps with a nod to &quot;Common People,&quot; refers to a young man who withdraws himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting incident. Despite the heavy issues (given the merciless treatment by director Christopher Cain), there is a dynamic in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated atmosphere of agriculture and the reluctance of adult characters to take charge of the situation make the film an incredible experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the film is almost a small reunion of &quot;The Natural&quot;. Too bad that this project has not achieved the necessary talent behind the camera to achieve an exciting and memorable image. * 1/2 of ****']
