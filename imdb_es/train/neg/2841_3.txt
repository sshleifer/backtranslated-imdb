SAKURA KILLERS (1+ from 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie could have looked great ... if you had never seen a good ninja movie. Cheesy 80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and much more kitschy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning ... with an old Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several ninjas dressed in black try to get close to him and he seems to be too focused on hitting his ball to realize ... Suddenly, put your hand in your golf bag and ... no, I will not spoil it ... if you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about a stolen video tape or something like that. A group of tenuous Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways in which the ninja is because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight better after their training than before ... well, the movie is moving pretty fast. The fight scenes may not be great ... but they are plentiful ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for some giggles.
