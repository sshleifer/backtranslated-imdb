I could never bear to watch Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie included Scott Baio (a skateboarding chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role becomes her usual professional performance, but that is not an excuse for this boring disaster. Two hours out of my life that I will never return! No notable personages, incredible history, questionable edition and horrible cinematography, but the worst of all is that I did not care less. The story of teenagers in California in the 1970s, where children live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse to watch a movie.
