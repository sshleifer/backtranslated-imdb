I have read all the comments on this movie. I am a great admirer <br /> <br /> of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this movie was based. <br /> <br /> The film is an ugly and degrading fiction of the truth. I do not criticize it for <br /> <br /> altering small details or events for dramatic purposes; It's <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, the reaction, the realities and the changes in EACH main character. It greatly alters <br /> <br /> the true relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry of a Tibetan woman (which denotes <br /> <br /> the culture of Tibet) to the gift of Harra in the music box, until the change of Harrar < <br /> <br /> Seriously, everything about this movie is fake, except <br /> <br /> for the incredible photography. I understand that the intakes of the Potala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> changing a real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them very important for this world, in order to build a <br /> < br /> the movie star is sad
