Do not get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized as well as the next guy. I'm going to ramble now. The writing, however, was unrealistic. A mother of the PTA who sells drugs, but is adamant that her drugs reach the hands of a minor. Give me a break. The presumption of the very nice character of Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not entirely nice. Basically, the lines of the plot did not go anywhere. I understand that it is the only TV land. The hypocrisy was shameless. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I'm supposed to believe this ... WHY? I just had the feeling that I was preaching a show that reeked of semen. It's like saying it's okay to cheat on your wife, but with someone of legal age. OK, it's not exactly the same, but I think you understand my point. I suppose the things about saving the children are wonderful for the campaign trails, but they do not contain water in a cable comedy about a suburban mom, as a local pot trader.
