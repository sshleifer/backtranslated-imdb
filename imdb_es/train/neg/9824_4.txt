Not being familiar with US television stations When I put it on the wire of my in-laws, first I thought it was just a low-budget science fiction movie, then, after a couple of minutes, I started thinking it could be a smart experience. Satire on the worst excesses of the Christian fundamentalist, and then I realized: My God, these people are serious! It's been a while since I've seen something so involuntarily hilarious. I hesitated to write a review of this for fear of offending the believers, but then I saw other criticisms and thought, hey, you can take them. Difficult philosophical dilemma: how to make a movie to criticize movies without really showing what you are criticizing? Answer: Do it in such a way that the only people who will appreciate it are those who hate the kind of movies you are criticizing. I guess some liberals (they spit when they say that!) Might be offended by the scorn of the filmmakers by those in the audience who are not obsessed with the myth of J **** C *****, but I did not . Do not worry, it was very fun!
