Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not prevent this movie from setting an egg the size of an emu. Based on the classic television series Phil Silvers, it bombed because: A) It was updated to the 1990s and B) The simple premise of the television series became a confusing, weak and silly script. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray adorable characters acting out simple and funny jokes. To expand this premise in a movie of the 1990s was to ask for problems, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this stench for the second time.
