Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's. Pretty Young Girls Endangered. I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the first shots of a road trip, you really think that for a second there will be quality in the production. Seeing "Unhinged" was like watching a class of amateur actors pass through their warm-up. Some of the most uncomfortable, poorly lit and too long scenes are represented with the taste of an overdose of Valium. I wondered why they not only put the cards in the camera so that the actresses did not have to constantly change their look. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T & A factor instead of talent. Laurel Munson as Terry's main girl is as exciting as watching the paint dry. Two nude scenes make for a teenage emotion. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy and spooky daughter and mother with whom the chicks are stranded competing for the worst act in history. Long pauses, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, everything is there and is a delight for those of us who love bad movies. The scenes change suddenly with the long blackouts that could lead through a Mack truck. The lightning of cartoons collides with the shots without even bothering to show the sky. Eighty eyeshadow assails the viewer. But you know, it grew in me. I felt sorry for it. I wanted to hug him, kiss his boos and do better. The end does not make up for the damage caused, but I smiled anyway. I have my own theories regarding all the "forbidden" hype and I hope that anyone who chooses to watch this movie does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise pass.
