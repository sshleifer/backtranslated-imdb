Although I never like to be the kind of person who denies the personal taste of another person; If you like something, it's fine. But, this movie was horrible and there is no way to avoid it. I do not like Ani Difranco too much, but I can admit that she is a great guitarist and composer. But I can not admit that this film has redeeming qualities. Many people consider it to be an accurate representation of the problems faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is portrayed too far-fetched. It seems that there is an attempt of "Naked Gun", a kind of comedy, but time is off; there is too much space between the lines of each actor, as if they were laughing (there were none). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to cover so many controversial topics in a film, almost never developed any of them in particular (especially the girl who was impregnated by a teacher). I did not laugh once throughout this whole movie. I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do more than roll my eyes at the screen.
