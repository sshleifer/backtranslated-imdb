It's as if I take the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, eliminate all their style and class and mix them with a lot of new pretentious wave "I'm an intellectual, so my movie should be difficult to understand." garbage maker, mixed in a few additional styles for a good measure, cut off the end, there you have Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a bit after seeing it, and yes I did. of meaning, however, that does not prevent it from being garbage. <br /> <br /> Waste of money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> It's like the worst movie I've seen in my life, not even with a bad film novelty value to exchange it a little.
