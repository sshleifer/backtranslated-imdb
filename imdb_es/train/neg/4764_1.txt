86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to look at it, and I must say that I am not someone who never falls asleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I had never seen such a useless plot acted so forcedly and forcefully, and I can only assume that the actors were as complicated as the leading writer who was supposedly in the film. <br /> <br /> Everything in this extreme adaptation is overrated. And if it is not the action of the wood, almost as if you could see the teleprompter, then the whole itself, which is over lighted and interferes in totally unnecessary ways, and over focused to an unimaginable point, is enough to discourage you the farce. <br /> <br /> As for the supposed commotion of a disguised detective, anyone who does not see that, as well as the rest of this ridiculous plot, telegraphed light years in advance, should immediately review his sight. . <br /> <br /> The bad performance, and of two very decent actors, together with the overdirected Branagh overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets instead of blank spaces. <br /> <br /> Above all, there is a completely laughable hue of homoerotic in this, increased towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a failure that people will never again try to emulate this level of cinema.
