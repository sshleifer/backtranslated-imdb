Ummm, excuse me, but was not more than half of the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then trying to escape several times. He breaks probation and is relentlessly pursued by Javert police inspector. On the way there are MANY characters that were not in this version. Some of those worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie, trying to see how it was related in some way to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
