I just watched this movie, and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. Basically, it is the bad Mormon news that plays basketball sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have had a root canal treatment. The performances of the cameo were obviously driven by sponsorship / financing. This movie had potential due to the scandalous behavior that Mormons exhibit when they play basketball sanctioned by the church, however, because it is classified as PG, the true nature of the show could not be transferred to the film. The acting is horrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the movie was completely unnecessary.
