This movie still gives me the chills of thinking about it. This movie was not only bad as in the low budget, it acted badly, etc., although it was certainly all that. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely horrible, but not the way that horror movies are supposed to be. I could see the first segment trying to be awful and failing, but what the hell is the second segment? It is simply annoying. The third segment is like watching an artistic film for students, which, surprisingly, makes it the least painful segment. It's an atrocity that this movie is not so low in the last 100, so get your votes (1/10) on the people! I know some people gave good reviews, but, well, they are lying in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Trust me, it's impossible that you like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is an incredible life-prolonging effect: it feels like you're watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed.
