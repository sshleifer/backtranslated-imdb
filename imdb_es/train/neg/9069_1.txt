The script of (David H. Steinberg) seemed to have some really smart points that could have been a good romantic comedy, BUT BUT, oh dear! What happened on the way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Originally it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although that was a long time ago, but those are the pioneers, the sponsors of the new genre: the crude adolescent comedy. Then came the decade of 1990. After important instances that became overwhelming successes (they add repulsive) as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (There Something About Mary - 1998), which I think the bums are affected by, there was the peak of the era and the prophet of the next era, the only one: (American Pie - 1999) who is undoubtedly and incomparably an icon of the genre. After that, I think that all such comedies have to be so dirty and unpleasant to be admired by young people. Otherwise, it could go out of style. <br /> <br /> I think (Slackers) had an intelligent plot first as a script, then its creators could add a lot of real: rudeness, filth, strangely brazen sex that would be done, in those days, so easy as a cake! As if they had to fill each scene with elements like masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc., just to look at the way. They are totally unnecessary elements for the story, but surely they are so necessary to obtain benefits and to capture the latest fashion in the creation of comedies for teenagers. The problem is in how all that has replaced any possible comedy in him. <br /> <br /> Some of their moments seemed literally horrible, and that's the point. It's all in the appearance and performance of (Jason Schwartzman); Memorably disgusting to the fullest. So the ambition was transformed from being that romantic comedy into doing what before was not done with pure images. To be more like a horror where you are asking all the time; What more unpleasant would happen? (vomiting, farts, etc. etc); This is the easiest combination to create a comedy today. <br /> <br /> Although even if you hated it, you have to love something (mainly for being bold), for me it was only Gina Gershon's scene. Anyway, they designed it as a whole to be outraged by outrage, like a teenager's naughty dream. Although most were close to anyone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What saddened me is that this in its essence was a real potential job, and not another cheap, other stupid comedy that finally managed to be. . Remember well the details of stealing the exam (the first 2 minutes), so the main plot of the movie (weird, trying to reach a girl through the blackmail of cool guys) through the pattern of (boy loves the girl and girl loves another boy) because he saves that, he is just an openly honest. He dealt with his material in the most sticky way that the dirty boys of the university would do, who had nothing to do but joke about anything. It ended up being, and I'm sorry to say, a smile * *! <br /> <br /> In the end, he said something (you can imagine!) about how is the time and place also for the impostor or slack gain, is like this comedy. It seems like a good ending to another totally better movie; what could assure my opinion about this as an intelligent one ... Once! And it does not take much to understand that the creators of this movie were the bums! Maybe being stupid is a way of being smart in Hollywood, but even if ... The end result here was not at least witty by any sense of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: Your screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who also wrote the story of (American Pie 2), has a main page in the IMDb, where you will find "Additional Details". His usual "Key words of the plot", which are: Sex / Vulgarity / Raw Humor / ... They forgot to write Urinating while bathing or undressing women of 70 years!
