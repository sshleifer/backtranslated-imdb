He was convincing the world that he did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that is probably remembered by many people. It's The Usual Suspects, of course, in relation to Kaiser Gold. I mean Sose. <br /> <br /> I got another one like that: -The stupidest trick a director ever did was to try to convince an audience that he really had a story: <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the pieces saddest of the filmmaking I've seen in a long time. It starts so well, with a really fantastic cinematography, a great performance and a very smart premise. But, unfortunately, the only way this film is directed is in a course of self-destruction. And he does it, not with a single blow, but with small and annoying wrist cuts. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity to a very plausible degree. I have seen and read a dozen totally different ways in which people explained the story. And they range from a story completely set in someone's head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play his enemies through chess games. <br /> <br /> And that's all a merry-go-round. But at the same time, it is a painful gift that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And, apart from that, in any case it is a forceful theft of some twenty films and books like "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle, and we are not dealing with kind loans here. It's a flagrant robbery. <br /> <br /> What ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the story turns like a drunken drifter in speed, if this movie were a roller coaster, you would have run into the attraction that is by his side shortly after taking off.There are so many twists in this movie that it will never be resolved, that if it were a cocktail, it would take a life supply of washouts for the work of nausea after drinking. Nothing is explained, and when you finally understand the direction you think it's going, you get into another. <br /> <br /> I guess this story was not going anywhere on paper and Ritchy I should have thought it was amazing to make a movie anyway, being the next D avid Lynch or something like that. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or totally violating one's job (Ritchy: seeking professional help). What could easily have been a gem turned into a piece of artificial art, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate in the Sunday afternoon debate clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid them at all costs!
