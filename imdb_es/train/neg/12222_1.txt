(Honestly, Barbra, I know it's you who is pressing all those "NO" in my review, 22 times, how many people did you have to instruct to help you here, do not you have anything better to do, like, do you look at the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I've seen since 'Citizen Kane'". That pretty much says it all, and it serves as a grave warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a safe cinematic disaster and one that will chase you, without letting you forget the tears of both laughs? And pain? The ingredients: the face of Barbra Streisand, a musical, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, the direction of Barbra Streisand and an ultra cheesy / idiotic premise. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, we know all this. In fact, almost all ?? by definition ?? He has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why would someone want to act? For the "art"?!? Well, if you are foolish enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews? And Streisand has the biggest ego of all! This is a great achievement. To be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and, nevertheless, to overcome everyone? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film, like all its "solo" efforts, is an ego trip that comes out of hell. Every scene that Streisand is in is automatically ruined. Still born. But since that was not enough, do you sing a lot of Streisandy songs? You know, the guy who allowed Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades. That's why he does not deserve one, but 100 episodes of South Park that make fun of her. <br /> <br /> The premise, Streisand, who dresses like a man to study and become a rabbi, sounds like a crazy ZAZ comedy. Besides being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman or look like a man. In fact, I'm not even sure it's human. How does she look in this movie, right? it can not be described in words. E.T. He looks like a high school sportsman by comparison. It looks stranger than Michael Jackson in 2015. It looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shudder. In particular, "Dad, can you hear me Squeel like a female walrus in heat?" and "Tomorrow night I will prepare the sequel, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose job at the beginning of his career, but changed his mind? When you were told that your voice could change? Can you believe it? I should have! Kill two flies with a single blow, that's how it would have been. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email. <br /> <br /> SHOULD STREISAND BARBARD FINALLY IN THE RETIREMENT? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
