Six GI, who are about to be sent home and who will be discharged, get drunk and sneak into a worship meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded figures, two dancers pretend to have a fight. Behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a painted figure emerges that begins to imitate a snake and finally bites one of the dancers in the neck. The imitation snake is dressed in scaly-looking body stockings. (This is definitely a female imitation snake). The member of the cult who has hidden them in the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies should not be interrupted and, definitely, no photos should be taken or they will be hunted down and killed. Naturally, the GIs take a flash picture, send the members of the cult to an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and run out into the Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, the most offensive and sarcastic, dies from a cobra bite in his neck, although no one can explain how the snake went into his hospital room. <br /> <br /> Back in New York, everything seems to be quite old news, since it was discharged. Men settle in their civil lives, still maintaining the bond between them. His jobs range from the manager of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to the graduate student of research (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a pretty blonde girlfriend. Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. But everyone gets along and everyone seems happy. <br /> <br /> Then a mysterious and dark woman appears (Faith Domergue), and Marshall Thompson feels sympathy for her and hints at her. the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly receives a visit from Domergue. Something scares him so much that he falls through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows: that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths. They also estimate that maybe it is becoming a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with her suspicions and she demonstrates her point. <br /> <br /> At this moment, Long and Thompson are completely exhausted, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is also attracted to him. , although he must explain what "love" is. No matter. A final reckless attack by the woman charges against Long's girlfriend, who is not one of the original six offenders, and Thompson must throw the snake out the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to that of Domergue. The end. <br /> <br /> I think I'll skip most of the questions the plot raises. I'll just mention one of the most prosaic in passing. Who paid the Domergue fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who is paying their utility bills at the hotel? Who paid for his spectacular wardrobe? How is it that she speaks American English so well? What the hell is going on? The writers and the director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror films and, although not much effort has been made in this production, they have stolen some of Lewton's tricks without shame. In "The Cat People" of Lewton, for example, the woman transforms into a black leopard, but, with one small exception, the threat always stays in the shade and is even more spooky. Most of the transformations here use shadows as well, but unlike Lewton, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also made occasional use of what he called "buses". Lewton's first "bus" was literal. A potential victim rushes alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps. Something or someone is following it. It freezes in fear under a lamppost. Something crunches the branches of the bushes above it. She looks up. There is a loud squeak that makes your hair stand on end. It's a bus that uses its air brakes to stop for it. The producers used at least two "buses" in this film and they do not represent anything. A man is absentmindedly walking through an intersection, for example, and there is a sudden noise from a truck that almost hits him. There is no set-up for the shot. He is stuck with a shoehorn. <br /> <br /> I do not care much about movies that perpetuate the stereotype of snakes as muddy, ugly, poisonous and phallic. In fact, no snake is slimy, most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful. In addition, they are more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and their serpentine approach to goals. Do you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? Try a six-line corridor. It is a very fast lizard. When he sees something to eat, he hurries and swallows it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to watch some low budget scary movies, do not bother with this one. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.
