Who did the research for this movie? It was established in Baghdad in 2004, however, all soldiers carry UCAs and have all the universal camouflage pattern equipment. Nobody was using those things in 04. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie while it was deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling of the audience was WTF? This movie did not make sense, the characters came and went without explanation, and people did ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but obviously it's trying to represent something realistic. It fails miserably, but it is trying. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone came up with a lot of random ideas, chewed and swallowed, then vomited a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sat through the whole thing. GI Joe was one of the ones that really made you think in comparison to this. KEEP AWAY!
