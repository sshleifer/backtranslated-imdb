... because this was just horrible 101 The Dalamatians were fun even if they were formulated, but this is just childish nonsense. The same plot except with the split story of it; the most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw in the world; Tim McInnerny proves that he really can not do comedy (everyone remembers Percy in Blackadder, but that was his highest place, since everything has gone downhill); so poor management that if a group of university students had done this, you would throw it in the wastebasket and tell them to do it again, correctly this time. It is better that Ieuan Grufford return to Hornblower abruptly, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should hide for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe it could be too severe; after all I could not sit down during the whole movie. Gets 1/10; Just because I can not give you 0.
