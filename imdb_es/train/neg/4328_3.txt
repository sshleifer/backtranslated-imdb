Any movie with "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the United States, but it is practically unknown in Europe. For the general public. It is unlikely that "National Lampoon's European Vacation" will rectify this situation. The grisly Griswalds are just that: frightening. They are not funny. Clearly, Mr. Chevy Chase thinks it's funny, after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes, but she gets paid for it and did not have to shell out £ 2.50 for the privilege. The section set in England is typical. The same old old TV artists, Messrs. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman trot out the same old tired clichés, Mr. Chase gets lost in the hotel lobby ... yawn, yawn, yawn .. Bucking - Ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated because we never saw bobbies on bicycles two by two ....... Rosie's red cheeks on the little one - kids, I need to continue? The English are buffoons, the vicious French, the Yanks who hate the flounders. The Germans are pompous and swollen, (do not mention the war, Clark), and the lusty pinches of the Italians' bottom. Have I forgotten something? Any possible "funny" situation is killed to death, Mr. Chase burns desperately, Miss Di Angelo makes a sweet tint and the children are terribly bad. The fact that this franchise worked as long as it did should provide comfort to those who propose that you will never lose money by underestimating the taste of the public.
