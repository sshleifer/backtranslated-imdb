Before this release, Neil LaBute said the following about the 1973 original: "It's amazing how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack, I'd like you not to like the new one, but that's your favorite soundtrack. , I do not know if * I * want * you to like my movie. " <br /> <br /> Neil, a word. You may want to sit for this too; As Lord Summerisle says, shocks are much better absorbed with bent knees. Look, Neil, what happens with the original, is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most famous things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson and Bert Jansch, it practically kicked off the Folk New Wave of the 70s. Undermining it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or the story of Buddy Holly without Buddy Holly. The result is one of the most incredibly arrogant and useless remakes of a British cult classic since Get Carter by Sly Stallone. <br /> <br /> The original apparently had left Nicolas Cage "disturbed for approximately two weeks". So disturbed, during the window of that fortnight, that he launched the idea of ​​reimagining one of the most nuanced films about interreligious struggle ever created by a writer and director previously known for his representations of male chauvinism, which are totally subtle. It's like a parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah faced Bambi? O Gaspar "Irreversible", Noe rewarded Love, Actually? (Actually, I would like to see that). Unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously: all LaBute did was tear the entrails to the original while saddling him with his own worries of sex warfare without gorms. <br /> <br /> After not being able to rescue a girl and her mother from a fatal car accident, the patrol car on the Cage road turns into a medicated whirlwind. He then receives a letter from the ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (this person exchanges names of tributes for congratulations), who now lives in the private community of the island of Summersisle. what extra 's' means 'superfluous'? and he wants Edward to help locate the missing daughter Rowan. <br /> <br /> Summersisle, transpira, is an articulation dominated by women, conceived as a refuge for oppressed women and refugees from the witch trials of Salem. Here, the matriarchs observe the paths of Olde, and the few males are almost mute race mules. It's like the Lilith Fair on a large scale. The main export of Summersisle is honey? a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, since he is allergic to bees. "Beekeepers!" Edward cries. "They seem to be everywhere on this island!" Well, probably that's because the main export of Summersisle is honey. <br /> <br /> In doing his research, Edward overhears an approaching Mayday ritual called "the moment of death and rebirth." He discovers that the harvest of the previous year failed; almost dies of bee stings; and finally comes to the conclusion (a conclusion that certainly could not be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a calendar of events on the backs of their hands) that Rowan will be burned alive in a pagan ritual to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the bee queen of the hive, Sister Summersisle (Burstyn), who has his own plans for him with the name of Wicker Man: "The unmanned plane must die." <br /> <br /> First of all, the good news: any concern that Cage is transported by air from the withering jaws of the Wicker Man at the last moment by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can rest Toast That's all for the good news. "This is a story whose chapters were carefully written," Burstyn intoned with sublime irony. Although it retains the basic premise of cat and mouse (and credit typography), what remains of the original to a policy of scorched earth. <br /> <br /> Crucial to Shaffer's original script was that his Christian Christian, according to Ritual, came to the island of his own accord? And most importantly, she was a virgin; The perfect sacrifice. By reducing issues to a sexual struggle, unlike a religious power struggle, LaBute presents the weakest qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage worked, he was the bait, honestly, I could not care less. <br /> <br /> And Cage is one of the worst things in this; A heavy and heavy donkey? an imbecile whose tongue seems a little too big for his mouth. "Damn it," he moans after hallucinating a strangled Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who has set his morning alarm a half hour ahead of schedule. Do you expect it to be the frequent dependence of your character on the pills that has reduced him to this state? alternately fatigued, then full of preppy, overbearing vim. If so, it is a good representation of an IQ not distinguished with antidepressants. If not, it's not worth thinking. Like Willow, the saucer-eyed Beahan is equally terrifying, presenting her lines as if competing with Cage for the "most carefree" delivery. While Burstyn completely lacks the mercurial threat to convince. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /> <br /> Each element that made the original great? the loving and detailed representations of popular customs, the witty score, the dialogue (the majestic Lord Summerisle "You did it wonderfully!" has been replaced by the less attractive "You did it excellently!" Whoah, friend! )? It has been replaced by a serpentine battle thriller of the sexes with an occasional hit. Namely, women run over; This is a LaBute movie, after all. The attack on Cage's sister Beech is just one of the most embarrassing episodes; The impotent little men will be screaming with joy at the way the hippie hippies finally achieved what awaited them, hyuk hyuk. <br /> <br /> The closing coda sees that the whole rotten mess collapses under the weight of the cliché genre: in a bar, two boys meet a pair of Summersisle maidens on the shore, looking for fresh martyrs . At the time of its successful collection, you almost expect the women to turn around and give an exaggerated wink and a thumb towards the camera. <br /> <br /> One more thing: credit watchers may have noticed that movies with an unusually high number of producers (nothing up to 10) tend to be No Much Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total.
