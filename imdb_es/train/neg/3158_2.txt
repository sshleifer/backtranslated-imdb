This really was the worst movie I've seen in my life. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And it looks absolutely horrible throughout the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They speak as if they were monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even come close to what the movie really is. Really, really boring. I had to move fast because it was very painful to watch. Do I really want to know how someone on earth could think that this is good? Jhaha literally like to talk and say "yes" and there is no passion at all. I could not say at all that they were in love. I'm sorry, but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I've never seen.
