The book on which this film is based seriously changed my life. But to say that this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, the direction, the cinematography and the plot were horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I've told many people about the book, but now I'll tell everyone that they definitely should not watch the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have omitted too many key components of the book. The film tried, but could not, deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only degraded the central theme of the prophecy. While I was putting myself in the position that I had not read the book, I saw Celestine's prophecy as a lot of B.S. I am completely disappointed with Redfield because of the way this movie turned out.
