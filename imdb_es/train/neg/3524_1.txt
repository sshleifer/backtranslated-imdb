This is one of the worst cases of cinematic nonsense I've seen in a long time. It's so horrible, I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I'm sorry for 'Sly' since he performs well on his part. But that plot ... Oh dear, oh dear. I particularly love the road near the end, he manages to jump from the foot of a mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on the way. A one or two day promotion takes five minutes! I could go on, but it's not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (that even a five-year-old could predict the outcome), the rest is foolish. Sorry people, but this is as bad as filming movies.
