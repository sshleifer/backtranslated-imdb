This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher in a Catholic school, watching how the RAWANDAN genocide is unrolling around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation about the past history and the rivalry of Rawanda. Then it goes down in history as told through the eyes of a young and idealistic "NEW TRADE", a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. When he and the driver approach a blocked road, he plays with his drivers I.D. without realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as the correct tribe for the soldiers, they will be killed. And this is how he treats the history of the chaos that develops around him. Suddenly, he realizes that all Rawandan (including his driver) are involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. The media cameras can not stop the machete, and there are too many machetes brandishing the men of the militia. the title comes from the army captain who says he is going to shoot the dogs that eat the corpses around his compound, but he will not shoot the men of the Militia who are killing people around the complex. Mainly because they have not yet shot the soldiers. Finally, he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the man who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the victims, flees with his tail between his legs, instead of facing the immanent death with the children from school. He has promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It is more a study of the character and a moment of Jesus for a character than a story about the genocide in "RAWANDA". This film did not have to take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place in any of the Holes of Hell Genocide in this world at any given time.
