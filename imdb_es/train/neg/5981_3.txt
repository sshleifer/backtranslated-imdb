I just watched this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the line of the story needed a little touch-up. Also, I think that this movie would have gone much better with more curses and blood, also if it had been classified as PG-13. <br /> <br /> That would definitely attract more people to see him -> teenagers. What would also attract more teenagers (particularly teenage girls) would be a great Brady Corbet approach to the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even though the movie had its low points, I still saw it and thought it was fine.
