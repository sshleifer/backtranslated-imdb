This was really terrible! I had a terrible story, I had a bad performance and it was like an amateur remake of dead dead but not so good. <br /> <br /> It took me all my tenacity to overcome this, it's a good job. I did not have to visit the bathroom! I doubt he had returned! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big Hollywood epic screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this movie was the endless supply of beautiful women. It's not bad between them! <br /> <br /> If you want to leave with your friends after a night in the beer, this is for you ... Avoid it like the plague!
