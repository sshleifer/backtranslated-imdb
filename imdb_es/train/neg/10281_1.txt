Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted food critic whose extravagant and domineering mother moves in with her. JJ, horrified by this turn of events, then blackmails the restaurant's owner, Alex, to entertain his mother in exchange for "maybe" checking his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls in love with the daughter while warming the mother. There are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is a selfish and hateful character, his superficial and superficial mother. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are malicious and opportunistic. The underlying message of a woman over 50 unable to do it on her own, without the help of a man, is bad, bad, BAD. The performance is uniformly boring, the script is not inspired. The only salvation of the movies is the scene of the city of New York. I would not recommend this movie.
