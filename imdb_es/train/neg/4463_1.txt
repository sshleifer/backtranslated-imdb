This is one of those movies that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and then some, like the time you spent accidentally choosing it, the time you spent when you got to the video store, etc. <br /> <br /> First, the look: it's grainy, it's low budget. Now that in itself does not make for a bad movie. But the way it was filmed makes the action seem unnatural, so it's a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> Then, the story. 3 girls go on a girls weekend away from the boys. Of course, as ALL they do when they go camping, they stop on the road to get outstanding. When they arrive at the area where they are going to stay, Mr. Ranger Sir stops them and scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car in the fire season, and then takes them where they are going. (a remote cabin). Of course, two "cute guys" roam around, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are hit immediately, but apparently Bambi is hurt by anything with two legs. Mady is quite disappointed by this development because she was waiting for a weekend to forget her ex and got drunk with her friends. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there's an old evil hermit who lives that way, maybe it's someone he does not get involved with, and the area and the cabin they're staying in have a kind of "reputation". <br /> <br /> Then, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, MUCH later) some of our weekend wood visitors start to die, and find several booby traps (although a couple of them actually they hit a little less than that) and, of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. Of course, there is no cell phone reception (who would miss the opportunity to check your cell phone in a movie to receive it?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps showing up at odd times and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he has said he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic turn that you do not want to miss. , if you're still awake. Pray that you wake up to a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and all the commitment is scarce and it seems incredible to me that it has even been launched. Avoid at all costs, 1 in 10.
