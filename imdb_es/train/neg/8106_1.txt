Seriously, why do American and French actors who pretend to be Czechs need to speak perfect English with a false Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed free nudity, but a soft porn movie would have more of that, and at least I would not pretend it's artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements were painfully didactic. Has the director heard about subtlety? The performance was also woody and melodramatic, and the comedic relief was never funny. The characters were very superficial, and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> What most made me laugh was when they cut the actors in archive footage of the demonstrations in Prague, and they went black and white and then cut to match the footage, just plain ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read many of Kundera's stories (not The Unbearable Lightness of Being), and there are good things about his writing style (although His themes are a great male fantasy), and I must say that the film did not transmit any of the benefits of the Kunderas style.
