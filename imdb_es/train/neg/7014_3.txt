What a waste! This movie really could have been something decent, but the writing, in particular, sucks, and the main characters are pretty superficial and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of the decline of the late 70s was well designed, but overall, this movie was a great waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, which deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the big BOOGIE NIGHT.
