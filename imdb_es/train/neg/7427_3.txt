When a friend gave me a boxed package of "12 amazing science fiction / horror movies!" Understandably I was a little cautious. But, given that the article was a gift, I did not really pay much attention to my common sense. After all ... free movies! So, what if they are a bit of rope. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of those movies. Ironically, it was the first option because it looked the best of the group. All I can say is that, if this is the best of them, I shudder to think how others are. <br /> <br /> On the surface, I had some good things going for it. Four (count them!) Actors I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy have been in a good science fiction movie (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) so they do not sign up for a turkey." Max is a veteran telenovela actor who never managed to enter to the movies ... but he's not a bad actor ... A Jeff ... well ... he's done the good and the bad when it comes to movies and television. " I soon discovered that Jeff had decided to add "the ugly" to his movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff makes his way enthusiastically through a scene of "I'm angry" before finally committing suicide. A funny performance of cameos, really. Unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the movie. It goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the mission commander (Williams) who is being sent to see what happened to Jeff and his busy crew choosing their new shipmates from the ranks of The Criminal Element. But this assortment is not so much the dirty dozen, but rather the unconvincing quartet. In addition, one of the criminals, a hacker, appears in his cell working on a laptop. Is not that a bit like letting a killer run a gun shop in the slammer? A pretty boring prison, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When the effects are finally removed, they are really horrible. It seems that the model of the spacecraft was shot down in one afternoon by a bored 8-year-old boy who has spare parts from his Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. While on their way to the area where Jeff's boat vanished, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by hosting virtual reality weekends, where they indulge in their male fantasies. All very well, and the use of scenes from his fantasies serves as an introduction to the "Alien Menace" that begins to appear there. But did they have to stretch it for quite a while? Alien intruder? Alien Bored, rather. <br /> <br /> They finally reach Sector G and the alien presence makes them fight with each other for their affections until only the old and good Max is left. The ending, in a really optimistic vein of garbage, points to a sequel, as if! Also making an appearance in this movie is a character that I will call "Sweatdroid". He is supposed to be an android, but apparently that fact was lost in the make-up team, which provided him with sweaty features at any time. But do not worry, it's just there to complete the body count numbers at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be honest, do very little in the movie. They just stay awake, let alone act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff has an early trip to the showers, so his manicity can not illuminate much of the movie. Max does the best he can, like a couple of the other cast members, but the movie is terribly atrocious, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The only thing this film offers half of your imagination is the naming convention of the ship. They all have the names of musicians: Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is tasteless and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought, in the initial visualization, it was one of those 80 direct jobs. It seems they still made fucking movies in the 90s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It is better to avoid it. Even as a beer and fries movie, this movie sucks, but at least you can overtake it, I suppose.
