Swedish action films have evolved in recent years to become something that mimics American action films like "Heat" but with a low budget. This movie follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a great and resistant film. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very bad, especially by the main actress. . The film tries to draw an image of hard thieves as military without remorse and a researcher who has completely lost it with problems of the past, but at the same time acts in a completely rational way. It does not have much success. <br /> <br /> The style of the blue background photo no longer seems fresh, and is not even well done in this image. Only a few scenes look good. In addition, the sound is quite strange and it seems that much of the real dialogue was recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, although he does not make a convincing portrait of a SWAT Leader team, he has some very funny lines. Also, the music is pretty good.
