Think of the end of Grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cuts herself - and a spooky mirror <br /> <br /> SEA AND UNDER WATER ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> it's not a good movie ... Seriously, I did not enjoy it at all. The movie poster is also extremely misleading and I discovered that it was only for people to see it ... I can not believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save time and money ... go see Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel like there's an effort put into it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and I are out
