Every time I make a list of the worst movies I've seen, this movie is always there. It has no redeeming qualities at all. It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and I would prefer to spill my own blood instead of having to sit through it again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see her in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show, a Saturday night. I, the only ones in the theater, was myself, and a group of noisy, noisy and quite rebellious teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. Obviously, they were doing well on Saturday night, and had come to this "comedy" to laugh a little. Before the movie began, during the previews, they laughed, joked and made noisy comments at a great time. I was in the limit annoying; If they had continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the movie itself, I could have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathetic with their spiritual fun, so I let it go. And they settled once the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this supposed "comedy" by the effect it had not only on me, but on this noisy group. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film's career, no one in the theater laughed. Not even once. Not myself, not the boisterous children. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the film was over and the lights went on, all of us, all of us, slowly left the theater in a slow, somber and absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect that this "comedy" produced. Not laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the funniest one. Preacher, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I consider that "Blazing Saddles" by Mel Brooks is on the short list of Funniest Movie Ever. I am still absolutely surprised that the same gentleman is responsible for the film Less funny of all. <br /> <br /> In summary: if you feel very happy, give a spin to this movie; Otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
