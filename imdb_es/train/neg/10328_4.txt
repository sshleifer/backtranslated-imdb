I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and the acting is bad. There were many problems that could have been portrayed in a better way, such as the protest against gay marriage or the search for the cemetery. The show can not be described correctly as comedy, since it lacks humor miserably. I must say that this program just succeeded in putting something into the life of the Muslim community. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had high hopes for this show, but I was a bit disappointed. Even so, I appreciate CBC for putting this concept in front of the viewers. Anyway, I wish the best of luck for the future.
