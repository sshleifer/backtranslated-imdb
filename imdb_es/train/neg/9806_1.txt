For my life I can not explain what the popularity of the children's TV show, the Power Rangers, is all about. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting kids liked this program in the first place, since the characters seem to be such idiots and it's not worth worrying about anything. <br /> <br /> The costumes look completely atrocious, like the multi-colored spandex that people wear to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this? Do you show up anyway, but for children to learn to fight to solve their problems? What about the terrible haircuts and clothes in this show anyway? Not to mention that this program is still playing on cable TV, just to earn money and teach children to fight each other when they do not agree with a certain problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for children today, I hope they are not as gullible as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway?
