With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you think it will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a horrible fake fire. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention the attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly disconnected and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie does not show it. <br /> <br /> That song about 'Arabella Cinderella' is pretty good, but that's it. I only recommend this movie to people who like to watch a film of extreme novelty, this is almost the definition of one. I suppose that this film, more than anything else, is a sign of the times, in terms of its definitive experimentalism and everything unconventional, the problem is that the quality is completely recorded and the writing, not to mention the address, It's all there. <br /> <br /> In particular, Peter Sellers is very successful, going from being Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to silent films like this and Magic Christian, which was very similar to this in Context and style, but that movie had some fun moments. This does not make sense, and I'm sad that someone as good as Peter Sellers has been in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
