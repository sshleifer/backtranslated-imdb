In the past, I remembered seeing funny Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show ... and then it occurred to me that this show was coming to a TV set near me! I was not static, but I was curious ... I was curious about how bad this program was going to suck. All my friends said that this program did not have any real meaning and was too stupid for heterosexual people like me to enjoy it (actually I am gay), so I decided to watch the program with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate that so many fanboys drool over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad play, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing more than a losing advisor to King Dedede (who sucks big in this show) and I hate the face of that company that continues to supply Dedede with those horrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this program. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more, since it was obvious that Nintendo was looking forward to getting some popularity for Kirby. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coldness, and Kirby will always be nothing more than a small and small cream of homosexuality. NUF said!
