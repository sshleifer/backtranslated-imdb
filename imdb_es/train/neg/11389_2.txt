If you like movies that wander with a small plot of exposure spiced with perverted sex, this movie is for you. On the positive side, the actress and main actress (newly arrived transsexual) has an interesting presence on the screen, but not enough to add much more than a slightly interesting movie, if so. Essentially, this film deals with 3 social outcasts (transgender prostitute, swindler and Russian, gay immigrant) who have somehow developed a link. Why it is not clear. We are expected to accept that these misfits are at the center of the basic honest people who have the capacity to love while they hurry their bodies on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety-something sugar daddies! The filmmaker shows a sandy and unpleasant side of life, while he wants us to believe that, underneath all of this, these severely damaged people are really normal to the extent that they have a menage a trois that helps them in life. All a fantasy, but unfortunately represented here as a real aspect of life on the wild side. In short, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. Unless, of course, you like to delight yourself with the problem!
