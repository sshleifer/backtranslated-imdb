INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Protagonist: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes PG Rating <br /> <br /> By Blake French : <br /> <br /> The new Disney movie, "Inspector Gadget" is about a policeman named John who survives a serious accident and is saved by a cutting-edge experimental operation that makes him a robotic agent similar to a machine that has tools and gadgets of all kinds incorporated in your body when it says "Go Go", only to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual structure of the film is very similar to the body formation of Inspector Gadget himself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a set of half-hearted devices that come together to do something that does not have much in common with anything else present. Basically, the movie is a series of extravagant action sequences that are linked with characters and an uneven story that only children between the ages of 6-9 will enjoy. <br /> <br /> The policeman who dramatically reinvents himself is played by Matthew Broderick, who, until "Inspector Gadget", was successful with films like "Election". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the hard-core villain of the movie called Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced a catastrophe this year with the dreadful "A Midsummer Night's Dream of William Shakespeare." <br /> <br /> There is a romantic secondary plot in this movie, as well as a lot of scenes involving Body Parts and extravagant mechanism elements from Inspector Gadget. It has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character of Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, both for his appearance and for his knowledge of a specific invention made by his late father, who was previously killed by Claw. The competition becomes scenes of struggle and a reason for many events in the film. Also an important character is the Gadget Mobil, a car similar to life that was designed by Inspector Gadget. It is expressed by D.L. Hughly from the comedy comedy "The Hughly's". <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I thought was pretty bad. I know, I'm not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten-year-old relative found that the film did not like it. The film is full of distinct defects and obvious problems. I never found myself worrying about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some opening credits ordered, unlike the much worse 1997 movie, "Mr. Magoo," which was opened with clips from the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for the same kind of things in this comedy, which is rarely funny and almost never convincing? The overall design of the production is nothing more than a mess of incomplete visual gags and consists of a joke: Inspector Gadget's clumsiness. <br /> <br /> In movies like this, the audience seeks limits, something to help determine what can happen and what can not. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such limits. Truly, this is just a party time for the actors, who surely had a lot of fun. It reminds me of another missing comedy released a few years ago called "Blankman" that, again, contained a lot of accessories and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all the gadgets and accessories, but they also lacked something necessary for each film: participation of the audience. <br /> <br /> A character that I found that is left out for a long time is the daughter of Gadgets, who at the end of the film still has no idea what his name was. It is only used as a plot device, and I wonder how they used it to promote the plot as well. For his presence he does not bring anything relevant or productive to the film. We never know your reactions to the operation or accidents of your father. Therefore, this is a person who could have been completely excluded and would not have affected the film in the least. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a horrible and insufficient excuse. For a children's comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this movie with the action image "Blade" of the violent and very anti-young audience. I'm saying once again that I'd rather have a movie in which nothing happens than one in which everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much in his favor at the same time that he literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
