The plot is absurd and lame, also suck are performances and dialogue, it is difficult to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a friend propelled by caffeine to wake you up in time for a couple of Gore effects. Why do they bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All the time, I wondered who this movie was directed to? Filled with lame subplots (like the Captain of the United States Army of Cannibalism) This is of low quality in all aspects. This movie is forbidden in Germany!
