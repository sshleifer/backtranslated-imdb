I saw this movie a long time ago (approximately 10 years ago) and I liked it then. I remembered it the other day and decided to see it again. The second time was not pleasant. The acting is 'very, very good', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> The acting ... I'm sure those actresses were not so strict as to play those characters. The plot ... there is no way in hell that these women had left with the first robbery, much less the second. (Side note: Why did not TT realize that, even if he came up with a lot of money for his court date, they would ask where they got it and would not have a logical answer? Ding, Ding ... We have a thief!). Horrically stereotyped black women by basically saying that the only way black women can "beat the system" or get a large amount of money is to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. You play too much in sympathy because they all die at the end (bar Jada) but it's not sad (you think "they were so stupid, they deserve to die"). You just do not care about the characters unless you're a superficial person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie is worth more than 5.
