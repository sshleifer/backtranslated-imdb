Okay, I'm not American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, has never been, and will never be a funny man while our later ones point south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skillful writers and directors and all the other talented characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the most funny and undated sitcoms the United States produced. How someone could have the audacity to even try to replicate the character of Phil Silvers surpasses me. To complicate matters, the exercise was repeated in Martin's attempt to be Inspector Clouseau of Peter Seller's, another failed attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unromantic career. Some of his collaborators say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character', to that I would say 'balderdash', his portraits will be forgotten for a long time when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured by future generations.
