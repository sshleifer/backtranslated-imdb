I loved the first season. The quality dropped a bit in the second season, which nevertheless had a great medium (Pegasus!). The third season was quite novel and original and it was good. The fourth season began to go downhill quickly, because they did not even begin to give us explanations, when at this point we were starting to need them. What the hell was Cylon's plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara taking the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive or reincarnate? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then the end comes. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well OK. But destroying the fleet? Renounce technology and renounce any kind of urban life, and spread a few thousand people in such a fine role in the whole planet? That's not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the program seems to be that humanity is always trapped in a cycle that goes from the romanticism of nature to a decadent capitalist society that invents the destructive A.I. that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope of a greater future for humanity, and is antithetical to appropriate science fiction. And do not even make me start with the angels! Religious trap of the worst kind! The last disappointment! <br /> <br /> The whole thing "all this has happened before and will happen again" should be related to the previous incarnation of the series, not only to Earth as we know it. Making the new show in some way consistent with the old would have been the final blow of genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
