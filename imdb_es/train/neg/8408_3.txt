Wow, this is very unusual in one respect: usually, the first movie in a long series of sequels is the best in the group. People are surprised when a sequel is better. With Tarzan, I thought that this movie was the worst of the group, or at least the first six that comprise my DVD package from the Tarzan Collection. I will be happy to see the sequels several times, but I have finished sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news first: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - A lot of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just archival footage. You see attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including the pygmies (called "dwarves" in the movie). Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can not let go of realism because they did not have it in the movies a long time ago. They do the best they can, so you can put up with the actors who speak in front of false funds. However, Weissmuller did many action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan form a beautiful well-built couple, if there was ever one in those Golden Years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has historical value (with so many sequels) that shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and her beginnings in learning the English language. <br /> <br /> The BAD: from the moment Tarzan takes "Jane Parker", almost all the scenes with her are Maureen O'Sullivan in a scene of hysteria, shrieks and screams. After the scene It's enough to give you a headache and ruin the movie. Fortunately, he calmed down in the aftermath, but not in this movie. The film also does not do any favors for the image of "The Great White Hunter" as C. Aubrey Smith, playing Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt", the safari guide, shoots all the animals to the sight, whether the beasts are threatening. or not. These people are very happy, particularly Smith. On the other hand, it is a pity that there is nothing here that explains how Tarzan was in the jungle in the first place. There is no history of him here or images of his growth. He is there when Jane and the group arrive at a certain point in Africa.
