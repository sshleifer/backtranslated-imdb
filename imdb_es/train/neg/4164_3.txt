<br /> <br /> What remains of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and hungry survivors. They must eat insects and insects, or whatever, after a war of poisons, or something like that, it's almost done with all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth who can still live comfortably, we will call it the Great Knowledge, has a great quest to prevent some seeds of secret spores from being released into the air. It seems that the Great Chief who knows everything is the last person on Earth who knows that these spores exist. The spores are located far from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of lethal defense systems. <br /> <br /> The Great Chief who knows everything wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. Therefore, he makes a plan to send a sexist action team to remove spore containers from all protection systems and secret locations. Sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to deactivate all protection systems makes it possible for spores to be released easily in the air. What if the sleeping dogs lie? <br /> <br /> The only nice feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As members of the macho action team do not stop falling with a predictable rhythm of mechanical rhythm, the charm of Vivian Wu makes the idea of ​​the plot of her former employer who wanted her so much acceptable. She is an object of love, an object of desire, a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> It is possible that the fans of Vivian Wu want to see an exceptional B movie in which they are a couple of years ago called DINNER PRISA. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
