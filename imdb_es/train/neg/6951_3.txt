Do not you hate when you order a steak but the restaurant offers you chicken? <br /> <br /> This is how I felt when I saw this call "Battlestar Galactica". You can make arguments about its quality, but the fact is that it is NOT what the fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in that proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You've waited years to get back the famous New York Strip steak that you loved. When your food arrives, you discover that they have applied the name "New York Strip" to a chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter simply says "but if it's okay, it's really GOOD"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted the New York Strip, a RISK! Then, the waiter explains: "ze zir ze ze chef wanted to make, like zay zomezing NEW We felt that ze cheeken would be more popular because we gave it the name of our delicious tasting earlier". Ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu, but be informed that because the restaurant has a dish called "New York Strip" now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip. Never more. <br /> <br /> Such is the case with the creation of something NEW and the slap of the same name "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> * This mini series is an affront to all the fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the production team in charge of this new version obviously despised the original. The team responsible for resurrecting BG should have LOVED the original series: seek to improve what fans loved, not try to sell this new series blatantly by exploiting the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel would like to give us a new show, then do it! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we remember fondly in an attempt to attract viewers. That effectively removes the possibility of seeing any resemblance to the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we liked something about the original. We simply did not want the NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things that ENCHANTED us of the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the BEST elements of the original were those that were omitted. Of course, the original BG was imperfect and could have used some update. This miniseries, however, was not an improvement in any aspect, but in the special effects (which were good but were nothing unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will debate the quality of this NEW show but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> That said ... I will offer some comments on the merits of this new mini by itself (not in comparison with the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. The effort was obviously made to make the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they were adjusted to the original films made for cable. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some points of view tried to falsify the effect of a "real" camera with a delayed tracking and abrupt zooms. However, it was used too much considering that there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only case that I have seen using "live cameras" effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing actions by security cameras. <br /> <br /> The script, questions? The script felt as if it had been written by a teenager, for other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the whole story felt reconstructed from other well-known stereotypes. The only good characteristics of the whole story were the few elements that were preserved from the original series. He was obviously "stupid" for the digestion of his average television audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was regrettable. Instead of a drama based on subtle glances, expressions and fine synchronization, each moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. Such was obvious in any interaction between Adama and his son. The director must have been trying to make sure that the more dense and insensitive viewer would not miss it even if he did not pay attention. I'm sorry, but real humans do not behave like the continuum. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered this a BAD program if it had stood on its own. Nothing big; He will never be revered by the real SciFi fanatics or artisans, but he would be seen by the masses. Although I personally could have lived without that. I only saw it to see how it really captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> The way this miniseries will always be remembered is a symbol of how the quality of the narrative has been put aside to attract large numbers. How even SciFi Channel has "toned down" its productions to cater to the masses rather than their true niche market, science fiction fans. It will be the moment when we ordered a steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave it with a single thought: <br /> <br /> DO NOT "MOORE". <br /> <br />
