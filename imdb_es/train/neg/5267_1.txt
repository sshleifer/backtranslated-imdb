The progression of the plot is enough to "bind one" and create curiosity about the result. However, ultimately, the feeling that remains is that the producers of the film forgot to finish it. If the intention was to create a perpetual circle (sometimes done in the Twilight Zone), it was too careless to see it as a positive effort.
