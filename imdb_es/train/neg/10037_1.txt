I had never thought that the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade so much! The film has a meaningless story that does not attract attention. <br /> <br /> Saif has acted in excess. Kareena has improved her figure, but she is not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. Let me say that the paper was not good ... <br /> <br /> It has completed a lot of low prices. I wondered if that was supposed to be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because the last movies were failures, does that mean that Yashraj films should make this kind of garbage? It has a history of so many good movies. <br /> <br /> In general, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
