In all the history of low budget. This movie has to be one of the worst. True, there are some comic aspects of the film, but in general it was just horrible. I just can not understand which person could not run a lot of slugs. I mean, they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that is worthwhile in this movie is the close-up of an attempt by the slugs to bite a man's finger. This was quite fun.
