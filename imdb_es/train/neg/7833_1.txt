I just watched the third week of Stephen Kings' mini series of nightmares and Dreamscapes; I mean, I've seen 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I have read Skeleton Crew, by Stephen King, a compilation of his stories that was published many years ago. I remember most of the stories were from average to poor, but there was one that was really excellent, if not exceptional. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that just because this mini-series is from a collection of Stephen King stories does not mean they will be good. In fact, if your previous collection of short stories is of any indication, then most of these miniseries will be between medium and poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I have not read these new stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in a book and do not adapt easily to television, or perhaps it was the writers' fault when trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. Also, these short stories may have been created exclusively for this mini series and not for printing purposes. Maybe that was the problem. If Stephen King had sent these shit stories to an editor, I'm sure the editor would have told him immediately to make it more interesting because, as it is, it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear from all this is that the problem is with the stories / scripts and not with the actors and actresses, because this miniseries has some excellent people who act on it. <br /> <br /> Watching this miniseries really makes me appreciate those old "Twilight Zone" series. Each series lasted only half an hour, but it was fascinating and fascinating. I do not understand why this mini series could not achieve a similar feat. I am sure that this mini series had a good amount of money to make a good mini series, but unfortunately, something must not have clicked. <br /> <br /> For example, this week showed two episodes. The first involved a horror story writer who buys an image drawn by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes in the image as he drives home. Feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the paint but keeps appearing near him. Also, the portrait of an individual in that image is killing people and is willing to kill him. (I will not even mention the second episode this week with criminals and their booty because it was even more boring than this episode!). This premise is interesting and the story should be good, but after seeing it. In doing so, I felt frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story, as well as strange materials that were shown that did not help the story. After the last scene, I had more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried to enter this mini series for 3 weeks, but it was too aggravating due to bad stories / scripts. If it was a movie, I would have recommended that people wait for the movie to come out on cable or something. I would not even recommend that you rent in your video store. However, since it is TNT, a cable channel, I would say that if you have not seen it yet, try it for a week. If you do not like that week, then you will not like past or future series, as they all share the same boring trait.
