['If you read my review of &quot;Dinoshark&quot; from SyFy, you know I can appreciate the stupid low budget that these films made for television can offer you. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still quite funny in a way &quot;so bad, it&#39;s good&quot;. So, even hitting with guilt for liking (and recommending) the undeniable &quot;Dinoshark&quot;, I sat down to watch &quot;Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy&quot;, an original SyFy movie about a half-man, half-hammer monster terrorizing people on an island . With the safe recipe from SyFy Channel to create B movie creatures and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually loses the brand ... not by much, but enough so that it does not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, your titular monster, the dreaded hammer-human hybrid, takes a back seat to a group of false military men who really become the main villain of the film. Although the hammerhead accumulates the count of corpses, he (or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be chewed up and leaves directly afterwards. The rest of the film is filler, confronting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. That, to me, is not as convincing as seeing a hammerhead that eats people! <br /><br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com']
