Without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story centers on four women driven to steal banks with whom we are supposed to sympathize. It is difficult to sympathize with the characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the police are with us, they know who we are, what do we do? ... Let's rob one more bank and then we go! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it is easy to know who will end up dead.
