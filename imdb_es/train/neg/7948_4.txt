"The seventh sign" takes a lot of "Rosemary's baby" and "The omen" (actually combines the two stories). Even its title recalls "The Seventh Seal" by Bergman. <br /> <br /> However, it starts pretty well, with all the omens scattered across the earth, and in parallel, a seemingly different plot with Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister) of the death penalty. At this time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering Jew is involved), which makes the lines sometimes involuntarily fun (have you ever been to Sunday school?) But they taught me that God was love!). In my opinion, it is the brief dialogue between the priest John Heard, who does not seem to take things seriously, unfortunately he was not given a more important part because his relaxed action is priceless, and the young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore probably recorded the same desire as ex-husband Bruce Willis: save the world. She does not save The movie for all that.
