The Treasure Island DVD should be required in any movie production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the film and then listening to the writer / director's comments graphically demonstrates the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the devil is talking about the director. The stated purpose of the director is to make a film without the "Hollywood conventions". Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the consistency of the character and the clarity of the concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand the points where he has deliberately avoided a "Hollywood cliché." However, he never seems to understand the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are shorthand to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they need to be replaced by some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich in potential. Two puppets are assigned to make a personality and a fund for an unidentified corpse to be used in a disinformation mission in the final days of World War II. Soon, each one begins to populate his personal fantasies with the character and his invention becomes increasingly real for them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of telling traditional stories could create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie is certainly not! The puppets do their best to give these characters consistency, but all too often they are defeated by the dazed and confusing script. In particular, I am increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who interprets the animated corpse. In several muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
