This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "Just like the people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from the area and experienced the movie as "Just like people in California think we are!" I have lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked in minimum wage jobs there. We laugh a lot, we connect and take breaks with people of our age; The young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no more sad in the winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Aside from the condescension "if you live in a prefabricated house, you must be depressed", the story lacked elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst drawn. It is doubtful that someone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if he had, he probably would have made friends there. I have read reviews that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and thinner", but if this is the case, it is not shown. All we really see is Martha learning not to like Rose for reasons that would apply equally if the three friends were of the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling excluded during smoking sessions, left out of the cycle when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally lack of respect and pain. <br /> <br /> Just one more thing: are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he once had some panic attacks? Please. This takes the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
