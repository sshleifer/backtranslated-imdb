The only thing that The First Power really has in its favor is that it gives Jeff Kober the chance to play one of the adorable psychotic villains he has done so well in the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in those parts in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough, The First Power is an improved slasher movie that has Lou Diamond Phillips lost as an LAPD detective who has a specialty in capturing serial killers. Kober is his last capture, but Kober is in the league with less power and they will come together to make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober receives the gas chamber, his spirit returns with all kinds of disguises. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is present as Lou's partner, who encounters an unpleasant ending involving a horse possessed by a demon and Tracy Griffith as Psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as nuns with ideas are around to help to Lou. Will he succeed in fighting against forces from beyond? <br /> <br /> When the movie is over, you will not care anymore. Lou really got stuck in a turkey. Maybe the devil made him make this movie.
