This movie was really horrible. The performance was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old one. At first I thought for myself, well, it's an old movie. Then I remembered that that is not an excuse! I've seen old movies with a better performance and that. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really choppy. The edition was deficient (most of the dialogue was out of sync). <br /> <br /> In general, this movie does not even deserve a 1. I only saw it because it was very boring, and the movie barely entertained me. It was simply laughable. The left little finger of my dead grandmother could make a better movie than this one.
