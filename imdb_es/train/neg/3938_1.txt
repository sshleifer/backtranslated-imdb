Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish from a movie. For starters, the script was definitely written to turn it into a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to rise from television) and Hutton (looking for the "two" of a "double hit" expected That would define his career after "ordinary people" clung to the image: corny lines, big and bad wipes from scene to scene (C'mon, who uses the wipes after the 12th grade Telecommunications class?), and this old movie of bad acting, even Duchovny is not immune to the plague of bad acting that is this movie.Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material.I must admit that I felt Duchovny's pain when reading the lines that are the voiceover Although I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the last line of Duchonvey's voice-over: "If you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911." Only the studio would have called 911, this dog from a movie never would have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
