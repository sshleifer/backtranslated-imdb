This version moved a bit slow for my liking and I guess I have problems with this game to start. But first, the film is a typical version of a TV work, which means it does not have the style of the original version of the film with William Holden. What could not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the film until 1966? So could you give the little sister a line about the protests of the Vietnam War? Why not 1963 and give it a line on the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the casting, some fail. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand loses many of the notes. He is credible as a former BMOC athlete, but he does not have the sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looks a bit like a gorilla so that all the women of the city go crazy with him (sorry for the play on words). Gretchen Moll was lovely, but she seemed too wise for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But again, Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia was quite forgettable, as it seems that the mother and Mary Steenburgen can not decide if she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge game, I always felt that stories like this one of a young woman who chose passion for practice always needed an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I think I offer a possible epilogue with the episode, "Spur of the Moment", where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by an older and bitter Diana Hyland, because the youngest, Diana Hyland, chose to flee with a similar type to Hal Carter.
