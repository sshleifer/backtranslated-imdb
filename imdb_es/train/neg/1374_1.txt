Man, this was hilarious. It should be under the COMEDY. OR STUPID. It would have been easier to realize that a lot of stinks. Seriously? I want someone associated with this movie to be tested, effective immediately. For all those who are thinking about watching this "movie", let's review some points of the plot. Oh wait. There are none. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and decided to shoot something with someone at random, and miraculously, somehow it was recorded on a videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. You do not believe me. Go see it. Do it, man. I dare you. But prepare to get your eyes out. If you can sit without blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
