This movie was absolutely ... ugh, I can not find the word, oh wait ... shit! I mean, when it started, I was like, yeah, it looks good and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with having seen a late presentation because it was filth. Ram Gopal Varma has done everything possible, but the cast could never be up to the original Sholay. I mean, what was I thinking of doing a new version? What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year as he did for Black. Ajay and that other guy were good, especially the other guy who played raj because of all of them he was the one who saw. What was Amitabh doing? He is destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid movies. First Nishabd, then Cheeni Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now, I mean, you have to collect some of your money and move as far as possible from Bollywood before you lose all your respect and tell you that half of their way . I want to say that all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who now have a very good name due to the recent fall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks it's God and I knew that Abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, go see Heyy Babyy because it's the funniest movie and the number one on the charts!
