The main flaw of the movie is its uninspired script. Go back and forth between the vignettes of Bettie's story and the recreations of Klaw's short films. Although Klaw's recreations are well done, it is not necessary to recreate them almost entirely. Page Richards, although not an incredible actress, does a decent job in general. And, sometimes, she has a strong resemblance to Bettie. It is also worth noting the faithful attention to detail. Costumes and well-made clothes, as part of the established address. The sets are generally scarce and they feel in the stage, but they do feel of the time. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly designed to give the overall appearance a vibrant and retro feel.
