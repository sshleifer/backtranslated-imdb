This movie is possibly the cheapest, popular and poorest sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> However, it is Disney's funniest and idiot movie, and it will guarantee the laughter of sappy stories and silly plots from start to finish. finish. <br /> <br /> It's a group of short stories that seem to be bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first one is that Beast and Belle are petty in a pathetic argument. Then, three new loser characters decide to fix things by forging a letter of forgiveness to give Belle. Halfway through this little episode, Belle has eyes on the wall, which made my brothers and I laugh so hard. Then, she and the Beast fight more for the letter ... and then they learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly, old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, the next one is all about Lumiere being the biggest drug in the world when it comes to romance. This comes from the man who could court any woman. And they make FiFi a psychotic villainy that tries to kill Belle, and ends up releasing the Scot at the end. What a message to send to the children! <br /> <br /> Then, the following is all about Mrs. Potts being angry. And the next, after that, it's about Beast becoming too possessive of a bird, to the point where it just seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 errors that you can see clearly ... and the color is horrible. <br /> <br /> Belle is a gossip that shines brightly and that does not stop crying every time something goes wrong. In addition, it is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the secondary characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time, I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in this.) <br /> < br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is ruined in this. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and watch over yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1/10 for the sap, but I give it a 10/10 for comedy.
