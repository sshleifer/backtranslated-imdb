Jim Belushi is suffering a crisis in middle age, nothing is going well, when his car goes off ... he enters an empty bar where Michael Caine shows him what life would have been like if an event in high school had been different. A good premise with some moments ... but mostly flat and uninteresting. on a scale of one to ten.
