How a director of Altman's experience might expect us to want to spend time or worry about what happens to a main character who is neurotic, a whiner, an imbecile without redeeming qualities, that's the central puzzle of this. I work deeply confused. A monstrous piece of garbage. In addition to this paralyzing failure, the line of tracing requires a serious concentration to follow it. The configuration in which the character of Branagh is found is so obvious from the start that we are inclined to ask ourselves if the writer and the director have totally lost respect for their audience. This last theme is the core of the film: it represents the director's complacency with a deep contempt for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
