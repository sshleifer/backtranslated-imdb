This comedy is not really fun. It's a romance that plays so much with stereotypes that it has no impact. It's a derivative caper movie, yes, even back then, it has no effect. <br /> <br /> The cast is adequate. More than that is hard to say. However, the good thing is that the players are not familiar. At MGM, this would have been starring Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who does not have time for anything other than work could have been any actress. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little known movie is populated by artists mostly unknown today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. However, it does not leave a real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic imitation. And who wants that?
