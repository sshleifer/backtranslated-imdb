Let's see where to start ... bad performance; I'm not sure if I would call it that, since it rather reads in a script effortlessly. The actors did not even seem to be in their parts and seemed quite inanimate and apathetic. Of course there was a scene or two with nudity, but that could not save this movie from its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> Calling the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who really do it. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed to be more aligned with the nonsense comments. <br /> <br /> Budget? Does this movie have a budget? It seemed that they used less money than I have seen in a YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story could have been good if people were really interested in doing so, but there was no life in this movie; I do not care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I've seen some very bad movies in the last year and this is definitely the bottom. Do not waste your time or you wish you had heard this impartial review. Verify the qualifications, you will see that the 1's are rapidly surpassing the 10 fluffed with almost nothing in between. I wish I had looked a little closer before wasting my time. What a suck-fest!
