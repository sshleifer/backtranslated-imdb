Here is an indie movie that I really wanted to like, but ultimately I could not. The lack of a script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows and kills the image. History is a senseless disaster that is not worth trying to solve. I quickly got bored in 10 minutes, then I suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes, hoping for the best, before the chapter stops (fortunately) I reached the end ... even that was not worth it. effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be smart, raising its best sequences of EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not been done before, and better. This movie would have been much more fun as a short 10 to 20 minutes, but as a feature, it feels quilted and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I guess motivated it to extend to more than 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.
