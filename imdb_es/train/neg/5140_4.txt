Demer Daves, is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and the "broken arrow" remains in everyone's mind. When it comes to melodrama, you should leave it to people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The script is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you look at such a timid whiner. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by the "imitation of life" of Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe that she is a black woman. The man's daughter anyway? Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis are given parts so stereotyped that they can not do anything with them: the poor officer and the wealthy and handsome sergeant. Guess who will Natalie fall in love with? France is shown as a land of tolerance, where interracial unions are welcome. At that time (around 1944) it was doubtful, it is still for narrow-minded people who can find here and everywhere. .
