I rented this movie because I expected it to be one that the whole family would enjoy. Although the film is for the whole family, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false vision of God. If you obey God and follow him, you are not guaranteed success. Your soccer team will not always win. Magically you will not get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get an increase. Sometimes, you will be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy all our whims. Rather, we were created to glorify him. Sometimes we glorify it more when things seem to go wrong for us. To live is Christ; to die is gain.
