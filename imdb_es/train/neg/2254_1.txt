Okay, people, honestly ... this must be one of the worst movies about business programs that have been made, but I've been laughing at myself (which may be why I enjoyed it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and a way to get your own 15 minutes of personal fame. Did I mention that sex was an important issue in this movie? If you like bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you have the chance (and have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The funniest part of the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and show his wallet with his beloved's. images. A triple A for bad taste and fun!
