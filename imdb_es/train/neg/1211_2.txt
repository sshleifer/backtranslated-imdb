The only redeeming qualities that this film has are the scenes of death quite original. Apart from that, this movie is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the beleaguered housewife who slowly meanders through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. From the movie, he did not add anything. Then, the film resumes a bit, since it has a confrontation with 4 punks that occupied 2 parking lots on this busy Christmas eve. They begin to chase after dismissing the local security guard who tried to help her. From then on, this movie gets worse, much worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the flow, but she has about 5 minutes. She starts and can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, it leads to an average subdivision built next to a forest. Typically, he does everything he can to allow his followers to follow him easily. But now she becomes a tough mofu. You understand. Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this guy. It is so illogical that you will question each scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast, as well as for consumers.
