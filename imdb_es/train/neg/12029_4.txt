In general, I've found that if you do not listen to a movie before watching it on a DVD, there's probably a good reason for that. I had not heard anything about this movie until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and I saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I would give this one a chance. <br /> <br /> It's actually not very different from other movies in the genre, like The Singles Ward or the RM. If you like those type movies, you'll probably enjoy this. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this movie probably will not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid the openly religious (Mormon) message contained in it, and sometimes it appears boring and corny. Ultimately, if you're not within the Mormon demographics, you're probably better off seeing something else. <br /> <br /> It is true that there were some very funny moments in the movie, but I did not think it was enough to save the film in general.
