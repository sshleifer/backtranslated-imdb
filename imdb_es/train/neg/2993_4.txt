I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a good horror movie. When the body of a terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US Army. UU., The corpse is incinerated and releases the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon, infected villagers become meat-starved zombies, and a group of soldiers on leave must join a group of tourists and embark on an abandoned hotel while trying to fight the aggressive undead. I did not find this movie as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still a good horror movie with good action. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
