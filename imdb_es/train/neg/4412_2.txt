I would have given him one instead of two, but I suppose it COULD have been worse. I guess the performance is not so bad, but the plot is missing something that is even remotely interesting. It is a terrible movie! TERRIBLE! A complete waste of time! I suggest you not watch this movie. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
