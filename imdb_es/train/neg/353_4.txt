As other critics have pointed out, the film dies in the last half hour. However, before that, he suffers predictability and an astonishingly bland performance from Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found his character and ruins every scene he finds himself in. Connery is fine as Fishbourne, but most of the scenes are manipulated to get an effect instead of the truth, which overlaps the whole. with a sense of unreality. And the ending is just weird. Apparently, the filmmakers knew when they set up this disaster that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have a Thanksgiving dinner, so to make up for it they added a "dramatic" score in the cloud. Each small jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of a bad movie in the big leagues, this is one that you can see, otherwise, omit it
