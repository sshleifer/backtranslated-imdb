This film offers nothing new to a genre that has traditionally shown the intercultural love story underpinned by politics in the mid-twentieth / pre-World War II era in India, where the British and their modern forms are bad and the Indians primitive but honest and true are. good. Surely, these clich√©d representations of the British are quite past now. <br /> <br /> Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the action is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious. and unimaginative. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be developed and it would undoubtedly have benefited from another half hour of screen to give more depth to the characters and the narrative and give the viewer something in which to feel some investment. . <br /> <br /> In general, quite uninspiring. Oh, and Linus Roache just can not make a tragedy: having eyes crossed with emotional pain just does not work for me!
