The film tries to be a false documentary, filmed in documentary form but with many obviously written parts, but fails to provide the public with no character with which to create the illusion of the fake documentary. In addition, the film pretends to be a true love in Los Angeles, but it is only an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker who tries to make his first "great movie".
