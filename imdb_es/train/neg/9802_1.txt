Many people say that this show is only for children. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old), I watched this program first. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other children about this and, of course, other programs and you know what? This was the measure of disguise, every time we wanted to emphasize the nonsense of something (either on television or anything else) we said "Uh, like the Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site, I could not imagine that there are actually MMPR fans. It was so strange to me that I decided to see it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that vision. But I realized: maybe I do not have enough imagination? Can be. However, this argument is not enough for me to rate it as more than 1 star.
