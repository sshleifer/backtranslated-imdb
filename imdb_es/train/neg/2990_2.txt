Ohhh man! Now this is what I'm talking about! In regards to bad / cheesy horror movies, this movie was truly of a class of its own. A true jewel! <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie was not originally in English. It's fine because the voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there's a lot more to where this came from). "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty! FOR YOUR BLOOD!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a summary summary of the interaction between the military and scientists. Scene 1. Scientist: "Can not you do that? It will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "That's just science fiction" (then proceed to cause a complete disaster as predicted by the scientist). <br /> <br /> Scene 2? Scientist: "If you do that, many people will die!" - Military officer: "You do not know what you're talking about." (He does it and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3? Scientist: "Do not do that, it will kill everyone!" - Military officer: "That's silly" (then proceed to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You understand the idea) <br /> <br /> If that was not enough? There were some scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the army has literally 10 men pointing weapons at two unarmed men. The leader shouts: "Go for them!" And the 10 army men, one at a time, release their weapons and the fist fights the two adversaries! Instant Classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. He did not stop paying attention to the details! This movie even had an 80 '' hip '/ optimistic' 'keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! I realize that this revision may contain some spoilers, but there are so many good things in this epic that really only scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A true experience of watching movies! A masterpiece! Woohoo!
