Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's funny, funny, funny. Scott Valentine with the army uniform that is ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt to frown like a grimace. The leader of a special operations group is hilarious! The '' terrorists '' are as scary and realistic as the '' kidnappers '', this is so false and bad in everything you try, you have to laugh. The part where the giant T-REX that somehow slipped aboard a ship and then, somehow, underneath, explodes and you see that the metal stick protrudes where his head was, is the perfect ending. If you like bad movies, this is the pot of gold, the smooth mona of bb-bad!
