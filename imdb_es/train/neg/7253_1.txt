We rent the DVD waiting for a good western. The movie was pretty and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the bad guy kill the owner of the mine? It really is not connected to the movie, except to establish how bad it was and have a hiding place. <br /> <br /> The bank employee who turned bad simply acts too poorly to make a convincing decision to hire assassins to fire his employers. At least make us keep guessing. No character was developed for the owners of the bank or the bank employee. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in something happening. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after The gang confessed to killing the in-laws. Even more absurd is that he confesses that the judge and the judge will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous is that Martin hanged himself and broke the rope, then the sheriff took him at gunpoint to finally return to his city and save his wife from the bad employee of the bank. Would not he return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save his wife and arrest a bad guy from the bank? Just send the judge a note that the gang confessed before being murdered on the track? In general, acting very sad and meaningless to the film.
