This was just terrible. I read this book for school, I did As and all the tests, and to see it like that! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to see him, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 of Outer Space and Hudson Hawk together. What made this movie so terrible were the reasons enough to want to kill you. First, it was done in Hallmark. Second, the performance was terrible. Third, it was as completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I apologized. Basically, I would prefer to see Basic Instinct 2 than see this. Follow my advice, do not watch this movie. Nobody would want to see this. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
