Well, I like the gore in this movie, it's really disconcerting. Anyone who has gone to the dentist will know why. The story really is not that bad, the motivations of the character of Corbin Bersen make much more sense than in most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse performances, direction, scripts, etc. but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So everything comes down to whether you like that kind of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same as this movie. Just keep in mind that if you enjoy tortured people at the dentist, this is the movie for you!
