I do not remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as Justin Timberlake's in "Edison." I was so excited that I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, easily accept the desperate cries of nihilism. Timberlake is horribly grumpy; in fact, kicking him out is like kicking Andy Dick out to play the lead role in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But that almost does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is simply a bad actor and would be equally terrible in any role. He used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexuales lisp (read lithp), his youthful looks and emotional expressions that derive from something like "The 25 cliché expressions for actors", he poisons the screen on which he inflicts himself without mercy, and no matter how you cut him, I make. no and he will not buy his role as an amateur journalist turned into a crusader for justice. It just will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure. The director David J. Burke puts it not only in the main role (essentially), but also puts it apart Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good) LL Cool J I can imagine someone who is almost physically suffering from seeing some of the members of this cast interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is something positive about this: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin, it feels like a double relief. . A pleasure, if you want. Freeman and Spacey can not have more than 10 minutes of screen together, but those ten minutes are wonderful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But enough of attacks on Timberlake: the words are not enough in this particular case to solve the problem. "Edison" is a very, very common corruption story. Its plot goes from cliché to simply absurd. However, I admire the motivation behind doing it, which I interpret as a tribute to films like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco", or even "Chinatown". Do not get me wrong: "Edison" is not even on the same playing field as these movies, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire his reason for existence, perhaps to justify my presence. <br /> <br /> The script, in itself, presents a surprisingly bad script. Yes, he has some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (which is wasted here) and Timberlake seems to have been taken directly from an episode of Dawson's Creek. It's the typical dialogue too lightly, to impress the audience with how well we articulate (and fail). This dialogue, of course, is peppered with good music at the wrong times: sometimes it seems that "Edison" wants to transform into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through the performance, but precisely through the badly chosen music. and the speed of the variant film (read in slow motion). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It is sure that hell has a cast to kill for, but the performances are spoiled by Timberlake that simply does not work. In cinema as in most art, if one thing is off, the thing feels dull. Directors must make difficult decisions. David J. Burke lost the mark here. Some of the scenes reproduce well in themselves, but in general, they do not seem to fit like puzzle pieces of different jigsaw puzzles forced into an incoherent image. And it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to start with.
