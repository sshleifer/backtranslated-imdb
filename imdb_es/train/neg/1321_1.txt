Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. It has around three cameos of 20 seconds and what is Gene Barry doing in this whole movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that does not make any sense at all. The inept writer / director (the same uncle) destroyed everyone's talent with his horrible work. They gave me the DVD for a dime, so I can not complain! But it is rare! And it makes you feel strange and not in a good way. This was in the 70s and it seems that the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it is like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays a foul. It has that "Manson Family in acid" vibe. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other critic got everything he did with this movie? Maybe they worked on that when? In any case, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life that you will never return. Yes, it is horrible!
