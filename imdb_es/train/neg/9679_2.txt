This movie was horrible in the worst way: you just did not care. You did not care what happened in the plot; You did not care about the characters. All were devoid of heart. I ended up walking for about 45 minutes because I just did not want to put my mind to that anymore. There is too much sex in the movie. Sex can be fine; You can even make the movie (hence the Karma Sutra), but the relationship here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. I do not see this movie.
