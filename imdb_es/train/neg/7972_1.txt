I love movies B ... but come on ... this was not worth a degree ... The ending was silly ... b / c THERE WAS NO REAL END! ... not to mention that it's about life itself ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers? Slow as hell and then they start to kill the characters one by one in a 15 minute time period ... and I'm not even going to start with the part of the thing that kills the headless man ... and then neither You can even see what Jigsaw does with his so-called "new puzzle" ... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Go. Look at the painting in its tracks before recommending this forgotten movie to anyone. another thing ... ah, and to further improve the other totem of the movie, you can see the guy throwing the only creature in the basement scene from the window ... that was fun as hell and probably the only good part of watching that movie loss
