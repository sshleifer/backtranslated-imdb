This movie was pretty bad. Science fiction is usually my favorite channel, so I see all the original films that are reproduced in it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds quite familiar. What was it? Oh, yes, Jurassic Park. But this has the tigers of Sabertooth in place. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a few stereotyped university students on an island who conduct a treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a pretty scary death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going to eat the tourists, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers at first hand. Again, it sounds like the Jurassic park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000-pound saber tooth that crawled on its front legs killing the crazed scientist with a kind of tooth statue that somehow shrinks and goes through the boy's neck. The funniest death I've seen on television. <br /> <br /> The acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass through clay models, and even some of the sounds were muted. For example, when one of the college students is trying to escape, use an ax to knock down a door, the ax enters the door and, about 2 seconds later, you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were pretty funny though.
