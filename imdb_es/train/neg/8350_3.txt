I just returned from "El Otro" that plays here in Buenos Aires and I must say that I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow (Do not get me wrong, I enjoy slow movies!), To the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is Julio Ch√°vez breathing heavily throughout the film. This is a bad movie, but what is more important is a film without a mixture of inspiration, I did not feel anything for the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "The Other" was made only for the sake of Making a movie ... make it forgetful. I would advise you to broadcast this, if you want to see good Argentine films, look for Sorin's films.
