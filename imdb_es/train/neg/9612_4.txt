Until the end, the bad guys have the advantage, always, which puts into question the competence of the good guys. A couple of plots of innocent men accused of a crime are irritating. Some unnecessary dialogue in which various boring legal issues are debated. This is just an old mute and mediocre Westerner, so what's so silly about trying to keep things "realistic"? The atypical presence of Cagney in a western is one of the few, if not the only, entertaining thing in the film. Somewhere around the center there is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal; something like "Where is the child hiding? Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, will you marry me?"
