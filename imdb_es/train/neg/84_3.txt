When I was a kid I thought the killer's weapon was great, but I was a boy and that's why I was a bit silly. Even when he was a stupid child, although the plot of the cinema was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. What surprises me is that the film has a really solid cast. What screenplay did you read when you agreed to be in this movie since it is certainly boring and just a means to show a lightsaber on a very small scale? The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the ending is totally chaotic. The whole movie seems to revolve around the aliens and the only weapon. The plot has two children and a guy who has an encounter with an extraterrestrial, flash years later and there seems to be a return as if he were in the mix. Dead animals and others to be explored, and for some reason, the only guy gets the weapon from the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. Seriously, you just have to ask yourself why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer who has some scenes of good death, if you are going to have encounters with aliens that show more than a strange vortex of light, and if you are going to have lightsabers and then call you star wars.
