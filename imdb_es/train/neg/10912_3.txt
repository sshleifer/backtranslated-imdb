I really did not like this movie at all. It was not really fun and, in some cases, it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely an enormously talented individual and although his performance was good at this, it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in. I mean there were some parts that were nice and somewhat humorous in a nice way but that's about it. The only thing that really caught my attention during this whole ordeal of exaggerated jokes was that there were some very pretty women present and I'm not the only one He sees a movie just for that, but in this case it was the only corner. where even the slightest case of redemption could be found. Overall, it was a couple of notches below an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final consultation: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I'm glad I did not waste too much money on this. <Br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Ummm, let me think ... no! <br /> <br /> Hire: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not?
