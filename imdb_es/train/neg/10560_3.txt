A lot of other critics here, including many whose opinions I respect, hold this slice of the European horror of bad reputation. Personally, I did not like anything. It is an incoherent attempt in an atmospheric period that crosses sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well. Unfortunately, the famous exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's best-known films are famous for their high collection ratio. This, one of his first films, does not have the constant disgusting scenes that had his most notorious "Antrop√≥fagos" and "Beyond the darkness". Ultimately, it is an incoherent film that fails to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. Like I said, others enjoyed this movie, but it seemed like a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are some advantages to the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it, and she looks pretty sexy and is usually naked. However, the icon of the cult film Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a secondary plot with no connection to the main movie. He seems bored with paper and does not have the maniacal intensity that he has at his best. The musical score is pleasant and there are some brief involuntarily funny bloody moments. Still, this is a pretentious and meaningless movie that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
