HERA PHERI of Priyadarshan was a good situational comedy. However, this film lacks a story but it is quite funny but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not an appropriate story, but somehow it manages to get a good flow, although it is not nothing special. <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 funny scenes like the one that Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another one when Paresh enters. <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring slowly but the second half is more fun even though they are not a script <br /> <br /> The jokes are funny, although one wonders how they never listen the voices of each person from inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> Climax confusion is treated like a game on stage but it's pretty fun But the film ends abruptly <br /> <br /> The direction is fine The music is good <br /> < Akshay Kumar excels in his part, which has now become his second skin, but this is his film completely and eclipses all others. <br /> <br /> John stumbles and fails in the comedy Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is fine The girls ar sometimes and also uncomfortable sounds Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is seen now) are good in some places but often shout Manoj Joshi is fine
