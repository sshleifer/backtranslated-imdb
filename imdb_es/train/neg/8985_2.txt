The comments above encouraged me to verify this when it appeared on TCM, but it was a big disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but she does not have enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette are familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego of the character of Lee Tracy, who is, at best, selfish, physically and verbally abusive. fool. The reactions of "the public" are ill-thought and are incredible, making the "scams" look like artifice of a bad writer. And it makes the cruelty that the character of Lupe VÃ©lez can fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> The "stinging phrases" mentioned in another review should depend on the observer, since I did not even notice that an attempt was being made.
