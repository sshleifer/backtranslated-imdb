Usually, I enjoy the first Loretta Young films: her performance back then was light and windy, and she knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a loser of the word, except a funny turn of Glenda Farrell. Young is a girl from the porthole who tells her writer and husband (Paul Lukas) to become a bridge player. It is not the most cinematic of the games, and the long and very talented central part in which his marriage collapses almost kills the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is an interesting part. When Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk begin their climactic game, a series of quick shots show planes, trains, football matches, even a diver in the air, freezing the anticipation of the event. It is the first use of a frozen frame that I have seen in a US movie. I wish the rest were so inventive and fun.
