The characteristic of early 21st century cinema allows different evil creatures and bad types to confront each other. We have not seen things like this from Godzilla and King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you're splicing and in the midst of the haze of good things you have, you have an inspired idea and you see how everything develops before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to write it. Great ideas like all vampires are women. Hot ergo, mortal seducer but somehow I want to perish in some way. And all the zombies are men. Well, that's what men are like a woman right after they've thrown or cheated, right? So everything looks good until you actually do it. Then the rot begins. The Mosters have a fight. It does not happen much. Another fight Philosophical noodles and butt cod. Eureka we have found how to win. Great fight again and in the end. It sounds great, right? If you made an indie company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with an eye on it: brightness instead of what fans want. Everything could have been soaked in beautiful blood.
