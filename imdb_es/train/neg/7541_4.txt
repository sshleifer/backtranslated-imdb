Great mystery, but the movie goes downhill from there. The start is promising: a car accident and a woman and her daughter were burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized by this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter appears from an old girlfriend who asks for help to find her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island community mainly of women. They do not like outsiders. It shows a lot of stuffing with Ed, looking at the city through the city. That made the movie too long. Finally, it becomes a bit better towards the end when we learn about the crazy rituals performed by the woman and, finally, the sinister plan that awaits Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a well written story and it is too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this.
