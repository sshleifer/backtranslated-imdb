I do not know what that other criticism was talking about. Definitely, this is not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think there's a decent-looking girl in it. No, it's just a science fiction clog in the Ed Wood style, badly done. And it's bad. I can not even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw him late at night on the wire, and he was in shock. The fact that this movie has been released is an insult to all of us. The actors were friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke and the rhythm is incredibly slow. For me, however, music surpasses everything. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this, but if you ever see it by cable, look at it. You will be surprised at how bad a movie can be.
