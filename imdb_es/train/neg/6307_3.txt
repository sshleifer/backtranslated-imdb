I will give you a 3 just because it showed the story we need to know to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of the gentleman of the United Kingdom. The movie was pretty terrible. All clich√©, without real plot. Technical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specifications in the DE 529, or any kind of Everts Escort Destroyer, and you'll see what I mean. Now is the month of black history in the US. UU., And they'll call me racist just for saying this, but the story of this ship is not so big. They did some escort work, they chased a "submarine" that turned out to be a big bulge that they rammed. I'm sorry, but the blacks did much more in World War II, so this silly movie gives them credit. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name begin, I can handle it.
