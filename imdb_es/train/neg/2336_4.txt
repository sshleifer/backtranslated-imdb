I read some enthusiastic reviews here on IMDb and I thought about taking a look at this movie. Disappointed. On the positive side, male drivers are good, and some interesting pictures, but in general this film fails to convince. He seems to be full of his own indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful, but falls short and, in general, the image is an unconvincing disaster. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies classified as movies. noir, which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "A black cinema is marked by a feeling of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical characters". <br /> <br /> Well, that's the story here. : 3 losers stumble among themselves with their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. and together they conspire to kidnap a child and make fun of each other. <br /> <br /> It would have been a much better movie if the story was limited more to kidnapping rather than the faults of the character of the kidnappers. I thought that the female lead was very far from her depth and I found an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> While at some good times, I ended up feeling like I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
