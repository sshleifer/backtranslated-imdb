If you exceed the initial credits, this may be your type of movie. From the image of the first screen of a woman who puts her hands to her face with white sheets blowing in the background, a pretentious perfume commercial is remembered. Everything is downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The main actress is basically a block of wood that uses her computer to reach the past and reconstruct the memories of the photographs, to speak of the ignored genius of history, Ada, who conceived the first language of computer in the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Low-budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting, or even something integral to the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is lost.
