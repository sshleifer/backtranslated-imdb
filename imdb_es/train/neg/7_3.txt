This is really a new bass in entertainment. Even though there are much worse movies out. <br /> <br /> In the genre of the Gangster / Drug scene it is difficult to have a convincing story (these films do not, I mean that Sebastians' motives, for example, could not be more of an exaggerated and worn clich√©. ) Then you would also need a character relationship environment that is credible (this movie does not). <br /> <br /> I'm sure Tristan moves away from his family, but why was that again? What is the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to leave at his age? However, an interesting image to ask about the lack and the need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper class of the family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Although there would be the possibility of judging by the random Backflashes. He was not down and out anymore, why does he do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting questions raised here for a solid socially critical drama (but, again, this movie simply is not, because it focuses on "cool" production techniques and special effects and does not give the characters a moment to reflect and, above all, force the story along the path where they want it to be and not pay attention so that the story breathes and evolves naturally.) <br /> <br /> Wants to be a drama to not glorify the substance abuse and violence (it would be incorrect politically these days, right?) but on the other hand it is nothing more than a cheap action movie (as there are so many) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing not to completely ruin what remains of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So, in general, just ... I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for the edition.
