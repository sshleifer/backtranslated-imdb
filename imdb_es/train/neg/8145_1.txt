This movie is so bad that I can not believe it was shot. The people who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same sh ** should say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) It goes nowhere, completely incoherent, the performance (some dialogues are just ridiculous), the musical score (what's that?), The editing, and especially the artistic direction. , a pure disaster. It reminds me of the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of the amateurism of production, the mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with sequins stuck to it. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes we found here: you see in one scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, talking about her mobile phone. The next photo, which is in a completely different location, you can see this same woman, still talking on her cell phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, huge waste of money. Useless.
