['This movie only serves to show that not all the films made during Hollywood&#39;s glory days are worth seeing. The fact that you have an excellent cast does not mean that this can surpass a script that was probably written by a chimpanzee! Think about it: the film featured the participation of Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart, and it was still a bad movie! The basic premise of the film is not bad: a private psychiatric hospital where the staff is more fucked up than the patients! In addition, the secondary plot involving the overworked husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) had many promises. However, the script was handled with all the delicacy and dexterity of a drunken buffalo, with bellicose scenes and very high above and again in the film. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of &quot;General Hospital.&quot; Subtle, this movie is not !! Realistically, this movie is not !! <br /><br /> While most of the reason why this movie sucked was the horrible script, I also blame the producers for misinterpreting and abusing the veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name, but this character actor had exceptional talent, especially when he played gangsters in the films of Film Noir. However, here, Stewart presents himself as a very nondescript psychiatrist with a strange European accent; it just did not work, since it was outside his range of performance and his character was totally underdeveloped and one-dimensional. In addition, Charles Boyer seemed irremediably out of place and totally out of place. Seeing this excellent romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of the United States seemed strange. <br /><br /> In general, this is a pretty horrible movie. It&#39;s very observable in a train crash, but it&#39;s certainly not very pretty. My wife and I did not like the movie very much, but we also felt that it could have been very good if the writing had been competent. <br /><br /> PS: in a case of art that imitates life, Oscar Levant played one of the patients. In real life, the bright Levante spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions.']
