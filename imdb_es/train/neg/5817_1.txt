The most difficult part of this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotyped "white trash", the "plot" of the film atrophied from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so brazenly of body doubles that it was funny. Unfortunately, that was the only fun thing about the movie. Ms. Jenkins would be better served if in the future she refrained from using her life story to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film) is that my brother disbursed the money for this stinker.
