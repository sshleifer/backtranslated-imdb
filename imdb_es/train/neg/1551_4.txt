The Ladies Man is a fun movie. There is not much thought behind this, but what do you expect from a SNL movie? Actually, it's better than most of the SNL movies (ie, Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his brief scene (one of the funniest in the movie). Apart from that, the rest of the cast is average and is only there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen more fun movies, but I've also seen more foolish movies. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. Although it was more fun as a parody. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I recommend this. Just do not think too much or you will hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
