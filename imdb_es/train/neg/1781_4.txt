Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his film stories. A mother and her son move to a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; more signs of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige stands out as the mother. Others that appear are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King appears as the caretaker of the cemetery.
