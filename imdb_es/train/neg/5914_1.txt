This movie is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. It is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such low quality. I would never want to pay money to see this. I love the films of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, and I am disappointed that such a poor film can leave China. He seems to totally ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the film himself. The pictures of a person standing there doing nothing for a minute are hilarious and there are many of them. The cinematography and the quality of the video are incredibly bad. I searched for this movie on the Net and it seems that people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some fans of the film think that if a movie is not in English it is automatically good. I do not see any reason why people like this. This is not an art movie, it's a waste of celluloid. (That's if they actually filmed it in the movie, but they did not).
