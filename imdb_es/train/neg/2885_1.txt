I can not really say what I think about this movie, it's against the guidelines, I've seen a lot of movies and this has been the worst so far, with an extremely low budget, I guess all the money was spent The slaughterhouse scenes, because it could Do a better job with an 8mm b & w camera and a group of monkeys. It was so bad that I registered just to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone that the movie rental place was not enough. But this is the value of my 2 cents, I suggest you borrow it from a poor fool who rented it and looks at it yourself. Because I'm sure I would not lose money on him again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope it was not made at the place of rental when your money is not reimbursed ... =)
