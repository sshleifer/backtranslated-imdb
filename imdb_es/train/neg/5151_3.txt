I thought that this was a great idea but, boy, it was badly executed. We have a general idea of ​​how complex and challenging are behind-the-scenes operations of a show, but there is practically no detail on how it works. The producers do not seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a "direct line". (Which does not mean that they did not try, but that the managers of the scenario relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the narrative of the program does not tell us anything about the work of assembling an opera physically). <br /> <br /> We see many things happening, but we are told little about what people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments adjust and work together. For example, several times we find out about some type of problem: one expects to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is solved. But instead, filmmakers are generally limited to something else (in general, generic images of people pushing things or talking in headphones). <br /> <br /> In general, the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you see running under the final credits of a program, rather than anything that is worth seeing on its own merit.
