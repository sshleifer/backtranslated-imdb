After reading several good reviews, as well as listening to nice things by word of mouth, I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say that I was quite disappointed. The story was difficult to follow because the film is presented as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the best efforts of the actors, are flat and uninteresting. Sex is and nudity is more explicit than it should be. I have never seen a movie in which they seem so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many questions unanswered to a story line that, to begin with, was not well explained. In my opinion, a waste of time.
