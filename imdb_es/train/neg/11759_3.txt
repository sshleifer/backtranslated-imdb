For those looking for a sequel to the excellent South African miniseries of the 1980s, this is not the case. Nor is it a historical drama. Rather, it's a lugubrious little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historical Shaka, but simply uses its name to give a certain prestige to Sinclair's idiotic story about an African superhero that is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some moments of laughter out loud, like when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks a serious murderer. You know, as Jesus would have done if he had not been so weak. <br /> <br /> It's true, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine it being twice this shit. It would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what kind of name is Mungo ?!
