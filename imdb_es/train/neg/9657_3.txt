1) I am not a weapons expert, but I can even see the difference between the riffles of the United States Army in World War I and World War II. In the film we can see private, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (also known as "Silent Death"), used until World War II. Difference: M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires recharging after each shot. Small difference?! 2) The uniforms of the German army have borrowed since 1940 years as well. Especially the helmets. The German helmets until the end of the First World War have a significant pike at the top, we can not see even one in the movie. And if we do little additional search in the archives, how true is this "true story"? I am surprised at how "real" movie directors can be in a search for cheap propagation.
