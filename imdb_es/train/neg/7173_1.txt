I hate airplane crash movies ... ALL! In fact, I hate them all with a passion! First of all, they are cheap looking and do not have craftsmanship! Second, they insult the airline industry and tell the audience that all planes do it ... FALL OF HEAVEN AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why do I shudder in a movie like that? This can happen to any of us and with worse consequences than those suffered by the characters in that film ... which is the only chilling aspect of a disaster issue of an airline like this. I hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 films of stupid airplane chaos that are there before. Freefall is like everyone else: nothing but boredom before the classic dramatic scenes occur. <br /> <br /> First, we have the same cast of delays in this deadly trap: the family of three Cleaver-esquire, the yuppie baastard, and the stewardess bitch complete with a great blond hair since 1987 scolding anyone who be a little scared! <br /> <br /> My second complaint is that this should not be a long film, but a documentary that explains everything about the "Gimbli Glider" incident of Air Canada, also known as "Freefall", until the precautions of security. <br /> <br /> My third and last complaint is with all the airline movies of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless). Why the hell did the male butler instruct passengers to take off their shoes? (I could understand high heels and sharp and loose objects, but come on!) It seems that will make them more f # * king more secure than they are now! This plane if they (the passengers) did not know any better: they knew they were going to crash on land. Why would you force 100 wounded people to lower a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on the impact only to walk on their feet in a waste field? Does this make any sense to someone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and the hit ABC series "Lost" had more depth and realism in the air disaster than the simple "faults on the plane: people, panic-hostesses become disgusting, airplane lands without wheels in a field, people wander without shoes or jackets, etc. The same old shit from the Airport of 1975! The free fall was so typical of an aerial film that I almost expect to see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves breaking into the damned cabin of passengers at any time, could we at least see how these characters of bad acting return to normal instead of people rejoicing in the midst of imminent tragedy looming? A typical movie of a lifetime! Cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director of "Freefall" should stick to cheap movies made for television with middle-aged white women with stupid teenagers who use drugs and have marital problems. or to the suspense, leave it to the professionals ... you Why should we sit the audience for more than an hour and a half? It's the Washabe Rehash Airport. I hope God does not make movies like this anymore. If this were like the ABC series "Lost," then it would be something to watch. But this is absolute shit and something else. Stop turning every airplane movie into "1975 Airport"! This is not "Airport", it's a cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this film or any movie made by air disaster television to anyone, not even my worst enemies.
