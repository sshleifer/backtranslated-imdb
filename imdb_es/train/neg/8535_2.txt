['Like I said, the book was pretty good and this could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert had not been so horrible and incredible in the mainstream. What kind of accent is that supposed to be anyway? It sounded just like his horrible Russian accent in another movie in which I&#39;ve seen it. Every time I opened my mouth, I shuddered. It took me 3 tries before I could see the whole movie. Brad Johnson was as good as the other leader. <br /><br /> I really liked the location scenes on the beach. They added a much needed brightness to distract themselves from the depressing portrayal of Melissa Gilberts. However, I think they could have used the views of San Francisco more in their favor. It seemed that the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember that the character in the book was so depressing. <br /><br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future movie that requires an accent.']
