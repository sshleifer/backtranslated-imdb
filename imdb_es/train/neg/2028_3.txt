On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should have finished at least one full season. You had the entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a dozen beautiful long-legged models collectively called "The Million Dollar Dancers." You had well-informed contestants who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and presumably knew many trivia of pop culture. And you had a lot of money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was failure. A good game program needs at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting rhythm and the ability for the viewer to play at home. The best, the most durable have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM did not have any. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were among the most complex of all the primetime series of games in history. . Let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A participant started with a single word or short phrase, followed by the letters A, B, C (a subtle plug for the network?). Each letter was connected to a separate question, all beginning with that word or phrase. Once a participant chose one of the letters, he or she could answer that question or approve and select a second letter. If they passed, they could see the next question and had the same option. However, if they passed the second question, they were asked to respond to the third option. <br /> <br /> After answering and before finding out if their answer was correct, they had to select one of the 13 dancers. On stage, each with a different amount of money in a roll by his side. They revealed the amount in dollars (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the participant responded correctly ... or answered incorrectly ... that amount would be added or subtracted from his pot. <br /> <br /> Still with me until now? In addition, there was a dancer who had something known as "The Killer Card". If he selected the dancer with the killer card and had correctly answered his question, he was sure and the game continued. However, if it was incorrect, I had a final question to answer. If you misunderstood the final question, you were out of the game. If you got it right, then, the game continued. <br /> <br /> You did not have to quit smoking, you did not get the money you earned until you answered six questions correctly or you got six incorrect questions or so far The hole could not earn enough money to go back out . I have it? Good! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a total lack of tension, due to the design of the game. A contestant could pass questions they knew they did not know, and answer many questions that they knew, making the pressure even less. Then, they could still find a low dollar amount, even after they had knowingly omitted a question, which means that there was still no "drama". And the fact that they could answer five questions badly and have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pace of the questions was extremely slow: often the questions were so obvious that it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was some doubt about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The pace, the lack of real tension at any point during the show and those complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's Terpsicorean talents.
