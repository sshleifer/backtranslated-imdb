Twenty years ago, five-year-old Michael Hawthorne witnessed how his father killed his mother with an ax on an empty road and then committed suicide. In these days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with their grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent his greatest internal fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (the Head of the Moon by Byron), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration with the carved wooden doll Morty (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears. Forever. Michael's biggest fear is becoming a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty becomes his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and useless attack. Movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest internal fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy script full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; Others very weak, but in general the performance is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation of why the doll is brought to life; In addition, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or grief when each of them dies. The slow pace over more than fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a charm that interested his father and that I have not noticed throughout history. I do not know if the previous reference was published in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of execution time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
