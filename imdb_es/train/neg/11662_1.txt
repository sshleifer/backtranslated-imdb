I often do not make an effort to write comments, but for this I had to do it, only to warn anyone who might think that seeing this will see a comedy. This does not come close. While the premise (color change / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and has been done better, many times before) the actual transformation of two black men into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever shown on the screen. It would be bad enough if all that the script required was a change to the white girls. However, the Wayans brothers must disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you may have guessed, they completely fail. I've seen drag queens without makeup make women more convincing than these two with the best special effects and makeup people that Hollywood can offer. It is awful. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, a terrible dialogue and more holes in the plot than a golf course, and this movie reaches a new personal minimum. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
