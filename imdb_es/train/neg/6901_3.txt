The most positive thing I can say about this ingenious local production of "comedy" is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so amazingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of rewrites per committee has passed to achieve such a complete elimination of personality. It is not witty, it is not entertaining, it is not insightful and it is not charming. It is simply a serious progression, devoid of laughter, of four losers who must change their way of being, and their attitudes towards women, to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding. <br /> <br /> With a performance that would be unsatisfactory. the local society of amateur dramaturgy, a plot so tired that it would make the forty-third season of 'Allo' Allo look fresh, and joke as comically as seeing decaying vegetables, Sione's wedding got ten (yes, 10) nominations in the New Zealand movie awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone made sense and won none.
