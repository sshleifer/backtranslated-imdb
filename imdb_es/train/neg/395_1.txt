When I ordered this from the Blockbuster website I had no idea it would be as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I had forgotten to take my ADD medications that day. I know that from the moment the cast got into his truck, with its wide necklaces in the style of the late 70s, the bell bottoms and the hair with feathers, I knew that this misplaced jewel of the era of nightclubs was destined for the dumpster. <br /> <br /> The first prediction of how bad things were going to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc in the universe, forcing polyester music and quality porn. . the viewer of the aspirant From the initial scene with the ill-made effects to the "monsters" of another world and then the house that jumps from one universe to another was as painful as watching a primary school production of 'The Monologues of the Vagina' ' <br /> <Throughout the film, the sure sign that something was going to happen was when a small ship would appear.
