I've been a fan of Without A Trace since the main episode. I really can not express my disappointment in last week's episode. This is a REAL problem that many Afican-American families have tried and continue to grapple with. A recent study has documented the lack of media coverage in the first 48 hours. The application of the law, including local, state and federal, are also accomplices. What was the purpose of publicizing this topic and after finishing the end? Apparently, television can deal with almost any topic, EXCEPT THE CAREER. This is shameful. Collect it or do not explore it next time.
