While watching this movie, I tried to find out why they bothered to do it. Although the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. The marketing staff in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, the double perpetual crosses and the man and the woman who get too close and have sex. It is strange that we see more of them having sex than the president and his lover. The many frames and subplots make the film too wide and none of the characters is properly developed. I really did not feel that I knew any character, except that they are all corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete, it left me more than just wanting what could have been, but what it was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation for why someone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow film. It looked like a movie made by college students working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you're in a film class and want an example of what you should not do when making a movie
