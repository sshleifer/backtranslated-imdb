I picked up this movie with the hope that it was similar to the funny "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this false documentary style that became famous in the office but could not be delivered. The reason is partly the rigid performance, but above all the writing and direction. It is true that it can be fun to use all the clich√©s of RPGs, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what the "joke" will be about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is described well above. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there were subtitles "LAUGH NOW" or a fake laughter song in the style of the 80s, it would not make much difference. With some scenes you can not stop thinking "Yes, I understand why they thought this would be funny", but the way it is executed takes all the momentum of the possible joke.
