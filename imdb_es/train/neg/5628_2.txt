I am not an individual with artistic inclinations. I am a scientifically minded woman and I felt that this movie was perhaps one of those artistic type movies with a budget. I saw part of that with my fianc√© and my future stepdaughter. We try hard to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My boyfriend and his daughter rejected it and we went to Ocean 13, but that's another story. In order not to be discouraged, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another chance. I started again watching this movie seriously. I just do not understand it, I thought I would get it. I thought that the most fun part was the redness of the ashes and the urn that found a place next to the fireplace that was used as a vase for what seemed to be dead flowers. Interesting and I still had dead things inside. It was a strange and strange movie. Maybe this is what they were looking for, but I will not be deceived for the second time!
