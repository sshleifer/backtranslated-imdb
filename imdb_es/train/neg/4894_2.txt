What you will find in this film is redundant, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes. In other words, I found it technically poor. The musical fragments are directed in an amateur way (there is no synchronization in the dance of the aspirants, badly synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and boring. Eventually, it makes little sense and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are really efficient, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse, so it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand in the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer that I saw was very dynamic, that is not true for the movie. That is to say, the discrepancy between the trailer and the film itself is very similar to a scam.
