This show sucks. For parents, they generally want their children to see something good for them. It is generally educational, fun and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No. Doodlebops sing and that's it. Usually, they sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? No. Doodlebops instead say something that does not pretend to be a joke and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As for color, everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is always wrong in the Doodlebop world. Therefore, they are always happy. A child in trouble will be depressed because he has never been exposed to being sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is said at the highest level of exaggeration and very cheesy. It is excessive. <br /> <br /> For children, it is entertaining, but after 2 years you will not want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow.
