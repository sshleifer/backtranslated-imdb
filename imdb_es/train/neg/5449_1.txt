The idea is that something interesting happens in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked. Night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer. When we get to a point, it's so monotonously moronic that I thought I should have misunderstood it. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an Osaka owner who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time they worked in different shifts and, therefore, did not realize they were sharing. His friend asks him "But what about weekends?" Sean does not have an adequate explanation. Then, Sean tells the story of his own similar problem, which is that he is not sure that his girlfriend still lives at home, since she works during the night and she works during the day so that they never see each other. This has been happening for three weeks. But his friend does not ask: "Yes, but as I said before, what about the weekends? You should see her then, it does not make sense, what are you talking about, Sean, are you taking medication or something?" let's be generous and let's assume that they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean to see if soap and towels have been used. (In fact, strangely, he begins to carry the soap with him). But what about the conditioner and shampoo of his girlfriend, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush? Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is any missing? Have you bought any? In the bedroom, has the shared bed been made or not? Do you wear your clothes and change them for a clean one? Is the laundry basket more full? In the bathroom, is the seat up or down? I mean, what a pity! <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, Paul is preparing to leave work early to see if his girlfriend still lives at home. Why do not you call her? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse. In the last act, although no one told Vincent where the rest of the group is going, he manages to find them. The love interest of Lenny and Sean's girlfriend seem to be best friends and they also manage to find the group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily improbable coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is fine, but it is not good enough to compensate for the weak characters or the annoying story. Br /> <br /> I heard one of the actors interviewed and he promised "no weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought, "great." But after half an hour of boredom, he shouted on the screen: "I want weapons! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It would not have taken much to solve these problems but on the official website the director boasts that the film was not edited in a script. This is all you need to know.
