Ugh! Another of those DVDs "cheated by the cover". I expected some kind of action, at least, with bears, cats and others on the cover. I have nothing! Bad movie <br /> <br /> I forced myself to see this all the time thinking that eventually, SOMETHING would happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now the reason why I gave this a 2 is because of the landscape; Otherwise, it stunk. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, he spoke alone (although I guess they could not run a movie with silly music and without dialogue), making their karate postures to a tree. stump, threatening a raccoon, eating worms and (what a fool) kicking a porcupine. And he would not remove those feathers so easily ... they stick like hooks. At least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What happened to the flashback? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to watch a survival movie, not a dramatic story about a child who is going through a divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have made the bear eat the boy or something. At least that would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time on this.
