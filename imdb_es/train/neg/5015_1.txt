As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to watch many films and not all of them very good. Some movies are so bad that you will not be surprised if they premiere directly on video. With taboo, I am surprised that it is published on video. This is really little budget bad quality bad written garbage. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a taboo game. They write their most repugnant wish or act, and then people are killed for their taboos. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The movie has a possible interesting twist to the plot, and I will not reveal it here. But what could have been interesting is still stupid, badly acted and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors have played in bigger titles before, so why the hell did they sign up for this? If you see this anywhere, try to dodge it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this film.
