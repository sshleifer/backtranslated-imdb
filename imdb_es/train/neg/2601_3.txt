I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to see him as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his first movies. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl (played by the young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York to Los Angeles to overcome her recent and problematic loss. Shortly after moving to a boy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin = doppelganger, who is chasing her. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite poor and miserable. Both the dialogues and the acting make the film not really worth seeing. In short, it's something for Drew Barrymore fans.
