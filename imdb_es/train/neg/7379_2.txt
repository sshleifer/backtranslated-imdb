What was Steven Seagal thinking? I want to say in the first place that I love Seagal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His first things are some of the best in the genre. However, this does not live up to its excellent name. It would be expected that Attack Force (with the protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) is a nonsensical action movie with Seagal in the typical way of kicking the ass of a single line. However, what we get is a crime mystery, on the verge of a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadows due to its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who mutate the superhumans when they take a medication. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a disaster and a shame. Why bend man? The story is terrible. This gave me a 2/10 because of the scene in which Seagal asks for support despite having an army with him, and a hilarious fight scene in which Seagal swings his hands like a girl in front of the camera. "Revenge is a two-way street" says Seagal in this movie ... forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!
