To be completely honest, I have not seen so many Western films, but I've seen enough to know what's good. This is by far the worst west on the planet today. First, are there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a great movie on the wall that everyone would love, no, no no, completely delayed! Second, at that time, women, especially black women, were not likely to carry or use weapons. Does the Asian girl speak perfect English? If the configuration is western, Asia is not where you are going. Finally, the evil gay girl was too much, the movie was crap from the beginning. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm not racist or white either, so do not leave after reading this, but this movie, this is the movie. The worst presentation of black people I've seen!
