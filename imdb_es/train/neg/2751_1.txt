I hate even losing the time it takes to write 10 lines in this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that a bad film production is not a capital crime or he would be sentenced to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm surprised that this movie had a budget of $ 75 million, but actually I'm happy in the sense that it was a tremendous failure, that Shim will hopefully never make another film for the rest of his life and, therefore, will not you will lose nothing. More of the spectators. I think the actors would have already joined and lynched. <br /> <br /> With the resources available for the effects, you could have made a great movie with this budget. As usual, the ruling should have been seen from the beginning with the terrible script and the story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like "Citizen Kane".
