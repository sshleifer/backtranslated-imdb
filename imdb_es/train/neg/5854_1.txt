I just watched this movie on Flix after recording it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a big problem for Wrangler Jane, so I was surprised, I was literally surprised, to discover this movie that the homicidal and degenerate nurse was Melody Patterson, which looks pretty good but also looks completely different and unfortunately bad photographed I would never have imagined that she was in a million years. What the hell is she doing in an image like this? I agree with the guys here that the film lacks what it is pushing. No sex, no gore, no jokes. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain, also known as Monstrosity (1964 or more). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends huge amounts of time running around the house of the crazed doctor and the basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being abused by the police, all this boring and full of time. Now, if the Italians had done this, half of the movie would have been Senchblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam henchman who caressed the unconscious naked girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds.
