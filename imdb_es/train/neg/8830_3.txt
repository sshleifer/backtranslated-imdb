Too many holes in this movie to be nice AND, WORST OF ALL, a strange ending almost like Hollywood that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler, since you'll never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You will also need to have thick skin for all kinds of politically correct nuances. The conflict between whites and blacks was very artificial and unilateral. I did not understand why the author made the local black community behave in such an unacceptable way, is he trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A truly bizare movie. Just watch if you like being disturbed by the holes in the plot and you like to discuss all the things that may or may not have happened. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, the filming and the acting are excellent.
