I wonder how the actors in this movie acted. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, was she pretending or was it natural? It made no difference considering that even if she had been walking on the roof, it would not have changed the pattern of the movie. Brian Cox acted very well. I almost thought that I had always acted in this way, deceitful, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what was she doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such shit?
