Oh god, what a horrible, horrible movie. It pretends to be a commentary on the state of society, it is only a reflection of the worst of the worst in the reality of television. The interstitials organized by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant parts, written in a tone that may have to be thoughtful and insightful. Rather, these moments are numbed when they speak to the camera with a dialogue written by someone who loves the insulting and condescending speech that pushes the "meaning" of the film into the spectator's throat. <br /> <br /> Also, A point for aspiring filmmakers: long shots and quiet scenes do not equal art. Neither the extreme angles nor the logic extend to the point of the absurd. <br /> <br /> If someone out there is interested in watching this movie, do not do it. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
