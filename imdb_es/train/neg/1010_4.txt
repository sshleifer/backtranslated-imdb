I rented this movie last week. I saw that Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were in that, so it looked promising. And so it was, until Justin Timberlake came on the scene. He's a really bad actor and he should not be allowed to make a movie anymore. I mean, he's one of the most boring and uninspired actors I've ever seen in my life. It puts absolutely no emotion on any of its lines at all. Why the hell was he chosen for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better option. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it seems a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound great, but believe me, it is not. <br /> <br /> Now, the performance of Dylan McDermott is very good. It is one of the few good things about this movie. It is simply inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. However, it has some really cool lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated it was sometimes good. I expected a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
