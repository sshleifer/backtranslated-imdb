First of all, I must say that I worked for a blockbuster and I've seen enough movies to the point that I find it difficult to find something I have not seen. With this in mind, I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst movie ever made, it made me think of Gigli, My Boss's Daughter and any other piece of trash you've seen. BeLyt must be crazy, I've only found one person who liked it and they could not even tell me what the movie was about. If you are able to decipher this movie and you can tell me what it is about, you have to be the writer or a fortuneteller, because there is another way in which a person can solve this crap. <br /> <br /> FOR THE LOVE OF GD, stay away!
