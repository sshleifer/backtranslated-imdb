Director Spike Lee is famous for making films that point to racism. In many of the films, such as "Do the Right Thing," most whites are brutal racists. In this film, the theme of interracial marriage, with racism, once again, is the whole subject. <br /> <br /> However, what Lee does is demonstrate once again his intolerance against Christianity. It is amazing the double standard that exists in the world of cinema. If Lee or someone else produced this kind of bias against another group, he would be vilified, but the Christians? Hey, it's "open season" for them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this movie, shoots her son and then puts the smoking gun on her Bible. Put that in another close-up, in case you missed it. Hey, friends, here is another reader of the Bible and see how it is! Lee does this kind of thing in almost every movie he makes. <br /> <br /> Show the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with the portrait of racism as a bad thing? However, Lee perpetuates him in this movie as he has done in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards whites does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hello, Spike: start to "do the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "get over it." <br /> <br /> This is very bad because the subject could have been a film that provoked reflection if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
