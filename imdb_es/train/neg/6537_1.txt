First of all, I was warned that I saw this movie on television and in doubled English, which may have completely ruined the atmosphere. However, I will describe what I saw and hope that will keep people from that version. I found this movie unbearably boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is lost with the dubbing, leaving the slow frustration of a stalking film. I'm sorry, but the worst sin of the movie in my book is to be slow, except when the movie is about philosophy. I did not see any deep philosophical significance in this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it as I see it. I rated it with a "1". What can I say, tastes oriented to the United States, maybe.
