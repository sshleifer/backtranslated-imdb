It is my opinion that when you decide to make a very good movie again, you should strive to do it better than the original; Or at least give it a new point of view. Now, Robert Wise's account of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel, "The Haunting of Hill House," is worth the price of admission even today. Now it moves quickly to 1999 and remodeling. They left me shaking my head and asking, why? The performance is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with the amount of special effects that computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but I could not believe it was so bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how horrible it was, she said; "Well, they got your money!" She is right, do not let them get yours. If there are no gains in doing bad reissues, you may stop doing them or reach a higher standard that does not insult your audience.
