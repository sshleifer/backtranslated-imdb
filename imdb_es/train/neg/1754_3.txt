Why should the stories of Maria and Rhoda have to be so hard? Women divorced with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the show and the original characters? The characters of the daughter were stupid and uninteresting. Why can not there be daughters who like their mother on television? It makes sense that Mary left Minneapolis and Rhoda would return to New York, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems like an unfortunate way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together, of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there's been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, in the hope that Mary will do better next time she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping again.
