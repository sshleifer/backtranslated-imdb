It's hard to know where this adaptation starts going wrong, because I think the problem starts with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith discovered that you do not read them for detective stories, but for your deeply patronizing and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist. He has done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan, not so much as successfully, but because of it. <br /> <br /> Once I realized this, it stopped bothering that Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, is cast as Mma Ramotswe. If she represents a land that is not Africa, how appropriate is it for a black woman who is not African? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are too, too young for the roles they are playing, and too glamorous. Both brutally assassinate the local accents, and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they do not offer much in the way of acting. Mma Ramotswe Scott is inflatable, cute and soft. Mma Makutsi Rose is an annoying bitch with the mouth of the engine. <br /> <br /> The result is almost incomparable. The main cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who performs decently as Mr. JLB Matekoni. He is smarter and more intense than in books, but I can not blame Msamati for this: it is a bright light in an ocean of suction. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly at the feet of any committee of butchers who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, the writing of McCall Smith has always been very entertaining but notoriously bad. Refuses to be edited As a result, his books contain experiments in grammar bordering the scientific and characters that change the name of the middle of the sentence. Therefore, it is an achievement that the writing team of this project has made it worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicized. The characters talk about "openness" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi complains about not having a computer, but given her hair, makeup and constantly renewed jewelry, I'm surprised she does not have a MacBook in her purse along with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> And what? We stay here? It's hard to be upset with this fucking adaptation because, honestly, most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated by cute, non-threatening black people who are full of fun and tasty nuggets of wisdom. It reads well despite the linguistic parody, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wants black people to be. It just is not true. <br /> <br /> Given that, it's not surprising that this program is as bad as it does. However, it remains to be seen if the European and American audiences will notice, however.
