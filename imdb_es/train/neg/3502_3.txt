Sarah Silverman is really the "flavor of the month" comic at the moment. Is it really worth all the hype? Yes and no. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes very funny (your standing routine is quite interesting, although it's not always funny). Other times, you feel cheated by the media to surpass another artist. She is one of those really nice comedians to whom men come en masse, saying they dig their intelligence and their wit. But if you corral them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. It reminds me why many men went to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although neither of them is really "hot" now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be warm when she is 60, so her fans (especially men) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> As for this show, it's a lot like your comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When it does not, it is a complete boredom and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It is consistently fun, and has a really good satire. The character of Brian Poeshn has a sickly obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's funny to see him wearing a Tab shirt. But they never go anywhere with that, and eventually it wears out. The character of Sarah in the series is quite annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems to be stuck and actually never does anything for the show in general, and the secondary players (including the real-life sister of Sarah, Laura, it does not). Do not look like her) are fine. When the jokes come, they are brilliant. When they do not, they're horrible, and I mean really horrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (also known as poop jokes), which seems to have replaced wit and intelligence in the current comedy. So, should you watch this program? If you're in love with Sarah, do it. You can look at it and pretend it's yours. As for his show, it goes from zero to absolute zero.
