Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the script for the Aronofsky movie. That film was successful at all levels by offering an intimate and impartial portrait of the horrors of the characters' lives and the vices that destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has the vice and the many characters that live sad lives, but it hardly makes them the same justice as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes seems ridiculously anti-gay. Especially when in the film homosexuality is equal to death. A gay character is stoned, thrown into the sky by a moving car, and falls dead on the pavement. Another is crucified and even more are simply beaten. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, which could actually have been convincing had it been done well, are the scenes of the union workers literally fighting against those who break the strike. Who would have thought that a drama about Brooklyners would show action sequences and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a television director, but it is far below the real cut. films. The film is clumsy that it seems that it can not be established in a genre. Lake is assigned a useless role that any mannequin could have played, and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally scarce part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our protagonist, a detestable prostitute named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). His performance is not good and the fate of his character is dirty, to say the least. The misuse of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also eliminates the "real" edge of the most provocative parts. A failure.
