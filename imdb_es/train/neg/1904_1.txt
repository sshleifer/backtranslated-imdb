=== Minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. Then, when I saw all the beautiful posters that hung on the front and the trailer before MI: 2, expectations increased. A production by Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars Nic Cage and fresh Oscar-Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Much. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (what it really tries to be) or exciting. You put a black person who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa! Do you have comedy? I do not think so. The emotion is totally out of the picture. In the first place (and this is probably said many times) there are no understanding characters, who cares who they kill? If you can support the premise that a psychopath will kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic on the streets again. Is this emotion? Do not think. Then comes the best: the romance between Nic and Angelina. Actually, it seems boring to have to pronounce all these stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Are you seeing someone?' 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only a glimmer of hope: car chases. They are disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is only one. A very long one, caught in an irritating and agitated camera movement. I really had trouble following the action. <br /> <br /> So, is it an action movie? A thriller? a romantic comedy? - No need to decide, just avoid this horrible disaster. I will give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel that I am being generous.
