"The secretary" is one of those corny "thrillers", clich√© that one is bound to see on a Sunday afternoon, when there is practically nothing else. While the plot (an insane woman becomes jealous of all those who succeed over her in the office and decides to do what she can to stop them) may be unique, I recognized countless twists in the plot, probably taken from other television movies that He had been subjected for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not crazy about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in as many television movies as a "mother" or a kind of "victim" of dirty play or abuse, one must ask the kind of life she leads. In this, she feels happy to play a mother AND a victim of the psycho secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good moves in her career (Singles, Breaking In, and I suppose, Law and Order), she is also harassed by a series of unfortunate roles in TV movies, and this only adds to that. As for the others, I have no clear recollection of them, so I must say something. <br /> <br /> This will play on the Lifetime network (I think that's where I saw it), but don Do not bother looking at it, unless you're too bored for words. It's not that you're more excited ...
