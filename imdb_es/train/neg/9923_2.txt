While writing this review in 2008, we are immersed in a remake culture. The film studios seem determined to ruin as many classic movies as they can with totally useless updates, such as 'King Kong', 'The Wicker Man' and virtually all the movies starring Michael Caine. However, this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, as the 'Masa para el Do-Do' demonstrates. Dough for the Do-Do, a totally meaningless and colored version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece, "Porky in Wackyland," "Dough for the Do-Do" takes the life of the original by splashing the entire image with color Clampett's original and adding some new superimposed images supervised by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a totally unsuitable director to manipulate the source material of Clampett, although in reality no director could hope to approach the inspired madness of Clampett. Inevitably, then, 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the violation of a classic with a new and atrocious title. For fans of cartoons like me, it's equivalent to a 'Casablanca' coloring.
