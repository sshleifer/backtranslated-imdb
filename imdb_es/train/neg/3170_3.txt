There have been some funny movies about spirits that have come out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course, the best ones were Topper's films in the late '30s and early' 40s. And, most recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan "from 1941. These were fun and well-written comedies, all centered around supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes the writer and director Jeff Lowell, making his film debut with a story of an unpleasant, malicious girl, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is murdered on her wedding day and then returns to harass the new spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell) who is falling in love with Kate's boyfriend, Henry (Paul Rudd). Something that is clear at the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films "Topper"), which is the standard against which all ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There is a line at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry: "Do not smile". That accurately described my situation throughout this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is that the script is not very funny. But it has been aggravated by the presence of Longoria Parker, who simply rubbed me the wrong way every time he appeared on the screen. To begin with, adding to her lack of comedic talent, she is covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like? Kate dies as she prepares for her wedding for a frozen statue that falls. She is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her life is about after death abandons her (well, it really vanishes), so Kate returns to Earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to get out of the funk she naturally descended to after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, she should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces Ashley, who He really does not. She does not know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she's also a Catalan to make ends meet), to see if she can put Henry back in touch with Kate. There are a lot of meshugaas that continue. <br /> <br /> The emptiness of the film is summarized in a "B" story that revolves around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is thrown almost at the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she is as stupid as Kate. Since apparently Dan is attracted to these two women with serious failures, he deserves whatever he gets. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin. Not so, and more is worth it, because in other hands this could have been quite fun. As things stand, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. must be turning in their graves to see that this is what has achieved their brilliance in the first two "Topper" films.
