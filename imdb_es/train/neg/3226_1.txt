We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. Basically, the dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by a strange and old fart named Neweyes (who needed after having seen this movie). Apparently, Neweyes listens to the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the children's wish that the dinosaurs be taken to modern times so that all see them for blatant exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (Pity the screenwriters did not have it). By the way, does it seem strange that of ALL the wishes of children in the world, Neweyes grants the desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant the wishes of children to stop hunger? Disease? War? Well then! Neweyes has nothing better to do with all this power that he has? Finally, when the dinosaurs reach modern times, they begin to sing, dance and wreak havoc (basically, the kind of things you can see in a bad LSD journey, I mean where else could you see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping in a balloon). of Spider-man?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes children who have become friends with the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. Why? Why would children sign a blank contract? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take something ... "Drainage" that will let the children go. The dinosaurs, instead of tearing the evil member of Screweyes, give in and accept their terms. What?! This is stupid! They could have threatened him, dropped him the contract, eaten him and then left with the children. I think the filmmakers tried to prove that the violence is bad, which is a moot point when the dinosaurs finally escape and a group of crows surround Screweyes and apparently eat it completely. Oh yes, that is not violent at all! Back does not make sense, it's not funny, it's ridiculous, it's stupid, it's badly written and it contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to the movie. Even for a children's movie ... this is BAD.
