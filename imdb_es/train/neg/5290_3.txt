Usually I'm not one to chalk a movie. I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film is taking pictures of Anne's face while she breathes deeply, and the violin music plays in the background. The other part is full of bad acting and wood. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern manners. Anne is presented as docile and modest, which is fine at first, but remains the same throughout the film, and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. In general, the production lacks sense of the time, with too many mistakes that can be overlooked, like running out of concert, kissing in the street, walking in the streets without a hat (why is this scene in the movie? In the book it was one of the most romantic scenes written, in short, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
