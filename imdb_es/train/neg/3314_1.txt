Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled. How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider a poor adaptation of my second favorite novel by Jane Austen? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in some reviews; In short, it is an excessive and exaggerated imbroglio, from the initial credits to the end massacred. <br /> <br /> While many characters are misunderstood and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette make a presentation that is worthy of them, the worst of all is Paltrow. I have enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable: she is aware of herself, nasal, stooped and completely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort, although even a perfect Emma could not have saved this movie.
