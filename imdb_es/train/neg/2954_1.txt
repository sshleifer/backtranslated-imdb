I watch MANY bad movies, MANY !!!!!! It's a kind of hobby, really. Almost every Saturday night, a group of friends and I get together and observe the garbage of the whole world, ANYTHING. Turkish superhero movies, Brazilian vampire movies, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner movies, ANYTHING (except maybe Raising Helen) but I've never seen a WORST movie THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even entertaining bad in some way in Ed Wood, it's just SUCKING. Now this movie was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off her gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else that she hated this piece of craque = she tried to get out of her contract, she she groaned, she moaned, but nonetheless, they spilled her fat ass in this futuristic, skin-tight police uniform that's awful to see, alas! And you can see her furious during the shots, doing everything, but looking at her agent outside the camera so she can yell at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible that a third grade class could do a better job if they were promised cookies.
