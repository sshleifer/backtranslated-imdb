Hello everyone ... <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say for this movie. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes some friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend away from work. After picking up a girl on the road, things start to go wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself (written by the actor who plays Brandon, I think, although it could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and he acts accordingly. The same "Clown Killer" is a pretty sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark predator, mysterious but, above all, intelligent, we are offered a buffoon of rather awkward and clumsy children's songs that seems to be going through a small crisis of middle age. The only thing that justified the writing of this commentary were the scenes of sex and blood that were in the film (the quality of the film led me to enjoy such things). <br /> <br /> In summary, this film falls below all possible standards. It is true that I shared a few beers with a close friend while watching this, so we managed to gather some relative entertainment value from this movie and, therefore, it is fair to mention that S.I.C.K did not fall below a rating of two. However, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight), the rating of a star is a more than legitimate score for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star in ten.
