"The Dream Child" of 1989 is the fifth film of the series "Nightmare" (generally overrated) and, from this moment, the series became a total garbage. The only good films of the series were Wes Craven's 1984 originals, and the third part, "The Dream Warriors" of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the ex-crazy Freddy Krueger He began to Annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has almost nothing to recommend, except for images (certainly large), and a spooky scene, a flashback sequence of how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our crazy claws who become pranksters and who scream stupid phrases and the old formula of a group of teenage boys who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because old Freddy awaits them in his Dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a lot of uninteresting trash is added, like a super-silly "weird" child rhyme, for the sole reason of having some kind of justification for making this sequel superfluous and boring. .. In summary: there is no originality, only a decrease of the previous formula and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) score of 3/10 is due to the excellent visual effects, and especially to emphasize the difference in the terrible sequel following, "The Dead of Freddy", which is tremendously amazing. In case you are not a Freddy Krueger enthusiast, you should avoid "The Dream Child", and even if you are, this is very likely to disappoint you.
