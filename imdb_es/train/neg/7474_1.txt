This program did not do it for me, although I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the show ended. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there, since I am not a film critic, however, the guidelines in IMDb claim that you must put in 10 comment lines. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in each scene, and I hope the writers of this show can use a little more diversity to interact with the viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any of the actors and the team, it's just that after seeing things like "the wire", I've come to expect great things from the police drama.
