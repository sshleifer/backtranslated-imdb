There was some truth in this movie. I remember a story that was reported 15 to 20 years ago that 4 fishermen found a body in the water and chose not to report it until the trip was over. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or some similar charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Spectators outside Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this movie would encourage this perception. The movie itself reminded me of A simple plan. But as much as it is one of the best Australian films of all time, as someone said, I can not be so generous. Put it this way, I would not bother to see it again.
