I saw this movie for a project about love. Tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then reread the lines he is saying. My life can not continue ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... my brother was close. Obviously his fault. And since then, happy endings include the nice guy who takes care of mom, sad and lonely. No closing, bad script, and does not have enough minor character extension. Save yourself, unless you're ready for a good laugh. The costumes were made properly, and the extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie, but one that is more genre-specific, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual movie. It is not a movie for girls. He is not a strict romantic. And I can not show the children by sex and the questions to follow. All in all, it's just not a good movie.
