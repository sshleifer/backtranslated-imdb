This movie probably had some potential for something; My puzzlement is how these totally unprofessional subjects without grace continue to reach the cinemas, it is as if the ideas were recycled only because the generations are recycled. Truly, the decerebration gestures behind most movies are like dogs, they go back to ingesting their own vomit. Well, now it's 19 dollars richer because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redemption moment, it was somewhat remotely funny in the trailer (and there was nothing funny in the trailer), the performances were tense (especially Molly, totally unconvincing). What was supposed to be a comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney movies; none of his analogies came home, his little moral speeches were flat, he was literally waiting for them to say something meaningful, only to discover that it was over. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature that exists (apart from having a horse face with a strange smile); Honestly, I found her friend Patty (known as Hamburglar) to be much better than her. But, again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, anyway, the premise is that society is superficial and that if love is true, it transcends all social facades; the way they showed it, with one guy shaving in the scrotum of another and the routine of premature ejaculation millions of times mutilated and beaten to death (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness, the latter in the unpleasant outcome of the scene that involves the family dog). I feel as if the movie were like ridiculous jokes in a miserable ball without a form of sewage. It's going to show that marketing can boost anything, make any stinky mass shine and call it gold, people will come (it worked for me). Made with diatribe.
