I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings at the bottom of the cities seemed horrible. Also the mafia characters looked too weird. Warren Beatty did not do a horrible job like Dick Tracy, but it was definitely not one of his best performances. Madonna should just sing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just for the amazing performance of Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he still did a good job.
