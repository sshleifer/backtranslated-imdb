This movie has its share of negative comments and I agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever made. It is true that most of the films based on the works of King are quite bad, but this goes beyond the bad to the realm of the horrible. There is not a moment of fear in it unless you consider stupidity scary. It is the typical garbage of the king: the myths revolved around that did not make any sense in the first place, mixed with the so-called "scares" that are as shocking as PeeWee's Playhouse (which, at least, is entertaining). It is full of ridiculous moments, one of which is the character of Alice Krige. When she gets angry and starts making jokes like the villain in an old Batman television show, it's as absurd as getting sick. All the people who had cameos in this (including John Landis) are lucky they still have a career. But the most absurd part has to be the cat suits towards the end, which look like cheap rubber suits that someone bought in K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually outnumber the people in the movie.
