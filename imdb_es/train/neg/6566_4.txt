I saw this movie after having so many problems to download it through rapidshare. And I have to say that I did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so excited, I really wanted to see her. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that does not meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, but was based loosely on the classic "On the Boardwalk." <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when it comes from America. The address lacked quality many times, except for some intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to any of them: Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I have 100. Of course they will make an amazing movie. I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It just was not good enough.
