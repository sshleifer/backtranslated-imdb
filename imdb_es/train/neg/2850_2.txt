If I had noticed that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have seen it. It is demeaning to the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing for anyone who thinks. But then, most of John Wayne's movies are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) something different. The film is about Japan's 19th century isolationism. Maybe it's Hollywood that should be isolated. To put it in the most succinct way possible, this movie is a jingoistic trap (a kind of Madama Butterfly with bad music).
