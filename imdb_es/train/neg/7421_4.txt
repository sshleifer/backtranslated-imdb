Seeing beautiful women hanging around, playing cops and thieves is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures that the medium allows me to enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is designed and the script has no inspiration and is somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to different images of Hitchcock, including the choice of Kelly. McGillis in the leading role. She is dressed as Grace Kelly, and is not far from the brand. No way. But his character is not convincing. The way in which it is presented to the audience, must be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period of time, true events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates in the first few minutes and turns into an unfortunate tiebreaker crime story with incredible matches, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is even more regrettable, since the performances of the actors are good, as well as the photography and the design of the stage. <br /> <br /> The ending in Central Station, New York, is impressive. Start in the underground section and then move towards the ceiling. The film can be praised for its good use of architecture.
