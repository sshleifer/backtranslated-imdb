I did not even know that this was originally a movie made for television when I saw it, but I guessed it through the execution time. It has the same discolored colors, the soft characters and the horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform" that practically shouts "special after school". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe's decks and monsters (thanks) were made at the height of Dungeons & Dragons, a pencil-and-paper role-playing game that took the hearts of millions of geeks from across the United States. I tell one of those geeks, although I have never played D & D specifically, I have dabbled in one of his brothers. M & M was also made at the height of the great D & D controversy, which was so fascinating that people could lose touch with reality, be worshiping Satan without knowing it, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, though extremely rare, but this date is tremendously frantic. <br /> <br /> We meet with 4 young university students, who play the well-known Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from the mundane life. Except that M & M as it is presented is more boring than their mundane lives. Here nothing of the charm of the games is presented, and Jay Jay's request to take M & M to the "real world" does not come from anywhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere too, although at that moment we do not care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different, but they are all rich WASPy inmates who have problems that nobody really has. <br /> <br /> But things continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget is tremendously clear (I love the "Entrance" sign and the cardboard cutout in the forbidden caverns) Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in the most poignant scene in history, and the reward over the " Two towers "is involuntarily. hilarious Tom Hanks whined "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" It made me laugh for a few minutes. Definitely, the lowest point in his career. <br /> <br /> Do not see it as a convincing satire, just like a ridiculous piece of 80's television trash, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but everything is worth it for the breakup of Pardu in the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. It's not like I could go much worse from here.
