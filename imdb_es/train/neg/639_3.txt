The cliché of the soldier of the war who is in the war is given here a boring treatment. Pity that a splendid cast, acting at the limit of his great talents, can not exchange "The return of the soldier" from his rigid inability to move the viewer to become emotionally involved. The best moments, as another critic pointed out, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; But not even Jackson's good cinematic power can get the chestnuts out of this movie from his cold home and never warmed up. Ann-Margret, her reputation as a sexual kitten and very often accused of lacking the ability to act, finds her real and quite deep skills lost here, even though she speaks with an almost impeccable Middlesex accent. The hackneyed score, which smells of the lack of brightness of the television miniseries about the emotionality of saccharin, is at odds with the emotional distance from the script, the blockade and the exaggerated formalism of the direction; With the exception of his score and script and direction with corset, 'The Return of the Soldier' ​​has all the correct bits, but it does not make them work together.
