Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Written and starring Sylvester Stallone, which should have been enough, and with too many scenes of rock climbing, vertigo, falls, villains chewing scenes and a failed robbery. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a failed traumatic rescue, and the other involves bad people who ruin an airplane as booty and kill several harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the terrible cruelty of the product, simply mocks and calls those who do not care "Bostid!" In a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was cheerful and enigmatic when she played Maggie in Northern Exposure, is sadly lost in the part of a climber and rescue pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscular. There are no immortal lines in this. There are no lines of life, either.
