The only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the weird show that usually appears on the television show. This is also the main reason why fans of the television show will not like the movie, but that is not the only reason. This movie has as much entertainment value as obtaining a root channel. It approaches the abysmal depths of bad filmmaking, and then gets even worse. I will not waste your time describing this movie in more detail; Suffice it to say that I pity the poor of the chamber who had to suffer seeing this for the first time.
