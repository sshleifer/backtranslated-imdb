... the first movie I had to leave. And it was the pre-selection of the cast and crew (not that I was involved, I hasten to add). I arrived at the first hour, so I think I'm only qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> As with other comments here, how was this type of quality control achieved? An accumulation of the worst in the dialogue, the epitome of the performance in wood, the horrible cast, all wrapped up without a plot. <br /> <br /> The casting of Tara Fitzgerald was strange, almost comical. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I left the screening, the director and the producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. Obviously, they could not sit through it again, either.
