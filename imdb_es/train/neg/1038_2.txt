Raising victor Vargas is just a bad movie. There is not a quantity of negatives or publicity supported by the dollar with change, this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett saw that he did not have the money to make the film he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way by making a bad movie that cynically mimics the principles of the current "avant-garde film". Maybe he just does not know anything better. It's hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not difficult to say is the result. Except for a few spectators who will intellectualize the bad cinematographic realization in an attempt of pseudo realism, few will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know not. <br /> <br /> Do you a favor and broadcast this movie.
