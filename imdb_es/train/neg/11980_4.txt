This was marred by potentially large matches that were cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Death, but I think the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double. DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfecto would have had to do overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And this was the third ppv in a row in which Perfect Jobbed. Remember, before you never lost a game. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his highlights of the WWF, setting the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put on a new heel (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a prefiguration of Bret Hart's singles career, as he returned from two against one and almost survived the game. He and DiBiase organized a wrestling clinic, which made us forget that the goal of the match was DiBiase's boring fight with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Even though the Visionaries were the first team that survived all their members (and only the second since '87 to have four survivors), this match was not a squash. This was the longest game of the night, and Jake made a repeat of his performance in '88 when he was left alone against four men and dominated. I think it could really have bothered him. These days, the game would have ended upside down. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest matches in the history of the SS was also one of the most surprising. Possibly the most underestimated fighter in history, Tito Santana was the inspiring fighter of the night, put on war paint and put Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the Warlord in the last surviving match. It was so strange to see him overcome so overwhelmingly, and then return to his mediocre career. Sergeant A Slaughter also did well to get rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but that was not a surprise. Tito was. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival match was that Hogan and Guerrero won together at the end. <br /> <br /> This program was boring and the matches were also short. The debut of the Undertaker was great, but Tito Santana is the reason why I will remember this one.
