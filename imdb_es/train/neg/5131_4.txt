I liked it, but then I think I could have been ironing at the same time. This reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a romcom formulated version, absolutely undemanding, rescued from the direct ignominy of the video at its launch by the sharp turn of Janeane Garofalo. Playing the Pet Frasier, she finds herself trapped in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when a caller accuses. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, gave a shot to the Hollywood movie with this movie. He has nothing special and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising, although he has appeared in major appearances in the latest Terence Malick films. Uma Thurman makes a turn on the autopilot and Michael Lehmann compiles everything competently. However, icky phone sex. 4/10
