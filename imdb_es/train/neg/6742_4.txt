For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based on the haze of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only rate the movie with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between them. Two characters The premise of the film is a "pretty woman" inverse, with Dermot playing the role of Nick, a high-priced male escort hired by Debra's character, Kat, to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between the patron and the customer. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams stood out as Kat's sister. Every time Amy appeared on the screen, it served as a spark plug and a catalyst for the energy of the movie. Maybe if Amy Adams had been chosen for the role of Kat, the film could have had more dynamism. But it turned out that, instead of looking for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine to try at least to pretend that this movie had a genuine feeling and romance.
