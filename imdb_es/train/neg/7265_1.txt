I just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival, avoid it at all costs unless you have trouble sleeping. It is a film full of pretensions: it opens with a small quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and everything is downhill from there. Working with a camera: imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Line of the story: Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "The love I saw in you was just a mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to more than 2 hours but was filled with repetitions. For the pain that numbs to the brim, this film is aligned with the benches of the Methodist church to which my parents dragged me when I was a child. I want 2+ hours of my life reimbursed. The promoter Julian Hernandez preceded the observation with a comment that the film was "controversial", that is true only by the narcotic effect of the film.
