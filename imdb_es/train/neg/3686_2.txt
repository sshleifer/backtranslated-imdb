I'm surprised that everyone (even the critics) think that this was a good movie. It was the most clich√© thriller I've ever seen. We have the 'bad boy' who wants to force the 'good boy' (or the girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The "good girl" in this movie must use her intelligence and skills to defeat the "bad boy" and save the day and their loved ones. Using charisma, courage, and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (nice name) at an airport. One coincidence leads to the other and it soon seems that fate is uniting these two. Share drinks, sit next to each other, apparently get along in every way ... Is there anything else in this strangeness? Could these two be made for each other? Does 'destiny' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as a result, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so his men can launch an attack on him. Oh, if she does not do this, then her father is dead. Although we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson then explains how this will happen and why Lisa should help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa's defeats Her evil plans with her intelligence and in the process stabs him in the neck, they do trip over the chairs and hit him with a hockey stick on grass. Oh, and before that, she takes him in a wild chase through the Miami airport, where he passes security post 9-11 and steals a car that he then uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill his father. <br /> <br /> Yes, to the right. <br /> <br /> First of all, it seems strange to me that a man like Jackson, who can get high-tech weapons, needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just put a bomb in the building? Would not that make it safer for him and his team by excluding third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they threaten? Does not that make it easier to stop them for the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did everything possible considering the film they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to pay attention to. Also, I think Jayma Mays (who played the 'adorable Cynthia') will be someone we'll see more of. It's a shame that everyone has been stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
