I saw this movie last weekend and it's nonsense and pointless. An old curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are afraid and can not flee from an old man who moves slowly. They drop their torches and shudder instead of trying to push it away or, duh, burn it. Quentin aka Mr. Fabersham of the newlyweds is married to Diane Brewster, aka Miss Canfield, of Leave it to Beaver, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love story. The rest of the cast is simply followed in the tombs and waits for the screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl does not look bad but does not lend much to the film. Where is the mummy? Really just a curse unleashed. This is not an obstacle for Universal Mummy movies in the least. Watch this movie if you need to sleep, since you will take doses.
