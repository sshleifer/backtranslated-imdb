It's nice and fast. <br /> <br /> There is no way on Earth that the actor who plays Mat is eighteen. However, the main thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit for your audition that convinced them to throw it out.

In particular, the interaction between the policemen was natural and well balanced, and it worked very well. <br /> <br /> It only lasts about 45 minutes, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very polished and vibrant, and the backgrounds are atmospheric, especially due to the fact that all colors are extremely rich. The gang is identifiable for foreign audiences, but still manages to be clearly Australian.
