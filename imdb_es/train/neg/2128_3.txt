You do not need a remake, and you can not come close to capturing the original's charm. Extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and mostly lacks talent, not only with the performance, but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. They are all below average. He has a blatant disregard for the detail of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member who shows a special touch, Tyne Daly is not that bad. They should have left pretty well alone. The song goes from good (Vanessa Williams) to poor (everyone else). Look at the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.
