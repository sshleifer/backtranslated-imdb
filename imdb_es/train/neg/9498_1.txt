When I look for new cars, I hope they do not show me boats. When I drink Coca Cola from the source, I should expect the drink to contain Coca. When I see a film that is adorned with the name of an excellent scientist, I hope that it is in some way relevant to that person or his work. This could have been people discussing my grandmother's diary. The material covered is relevant only in the sense that they vaguely differ from science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to see it, and the second time I stopped seeing it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I prefer to see them in the last blockbuster. However, this is far from providing anything worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
