In fact, I saw this movie in the theater at its original release. It was painful to see Peter Sellers being ashamed. The story was incredibly weak and hard to follow, and the ending was ridiculous. It was sad to see how the powerful had fallen. I will not say I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt that he had a great performance in Being There. But this movie should never have been made. From what I read, he continued to produce this film against the advice of the people around him. Well, but that still does not excuse the studio that really launched the movie.
