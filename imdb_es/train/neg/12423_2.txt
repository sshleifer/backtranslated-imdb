Cage (1989) was another one of those low budget "friends" action movies that were produced during the 80s thanks in large part to movies like 48hrs. and lethal weapon. This stars Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno in regards to former Vietnam veterans who have a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and now he's pretty soft. Although it is huge, Lou has the brain of a child. One day, some ruffians throw their wait in the bar and Lou and Rebb take out the tar. But the refund is a mother. They hit the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That is until these two thugs enter the scene (one of them is a really nice guy) who have a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Maybe if they had followed all the way and made a hard-action movie instead of trying to mitigate the mercy of the situation, maybe it could have worked. Unfortunately, no, and the audience keeps the bag. Oh good. It's a shame because you have all the elements for a great series movie. Better luck next time, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
