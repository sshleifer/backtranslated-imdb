OK ... this movie could have been so good! All generations have been exposed to the Thunderbirds and have come to love it, and this movie has some of the features that one would look for in a good Thunderbirds movie. The boat and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while still maintaining the designs that we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, since Lady P and Bill Paxton, although it was not exactly what I imagined Jeff Tracey would be, was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to we create children of 8 years. I could fly 200 ton machines. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the fact that the film focused on the children, which made me feel like Jonathon Frakes slapped me with a wet fish and laughed at my hard-earned money. in the movie, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so disgusting in the movie and that he seemed to be able to fly both the machines and his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty simple machines to use if this is the case. <br /> <br /> The movie did not seem to know if it wanted to be serious or a farce. He tried to pay tribute while satirizing and, in general, simply fell flat on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
