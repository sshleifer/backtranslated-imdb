"It's hard for me to like to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship like a drama like with all similar pornographic scenes, like for example, and to wake up like controversies and do more like money and things like that." - Ellen, the missed appointment. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth And Stuff" is like the best artistic activity that has ever been done. Watching as Ellen's hairy arms and as Chris masturbating was like the height of my experience of watching movies in years and all that. But before I like it, start breaking new records of US-20-something-airhead with my "likes", let me now a brief list of the highlights of this visual aspect as a party: <br /> < 1. Chris doing the writing with his genitals. And not only that: the way the camera (guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick) rewarded the viewer with a full screen capture of Chris' fat white stomach after the non-Catholic action ends, was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more scenes of this kind in your next films, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of what started that brilliant and brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95". A fast w *** and then a white belly, fat and hairy: what more can a spectator ask for? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate (even though I'm straight) ... Poetry in motion. Such elegance, such style. No less than total, the divine inspiration went on to film that sequence, plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not be more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, thick arms. The close-ups of the wobbly camera, so ably photographed by our two cinematographers (I can not emphasize this enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion regarding the correct identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes in which we saw a part of a body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but it was often a guessing game: does that part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and his username, were purposely cast, because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender-based confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to guess if one is seeing a female or male leg. Patrick is very thin and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and pristine, while Ellen and the other girl are very silly, with their legs and arms thick. Sparkly. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant, especially the way it relates perfectly to the theme of reversal of roles between the sexes: completely original and mind-blowing. Ellen behaves like a man, wants to have sex all the time, while her former Patrick wants to talk, like a girl. Spiffing <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen's search for a left partner. "He must love 'The Simpsons', which is quite leftist." I'm glad that the creators of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us smart leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change. The number of "I like" that she and her liberal friends manage to pronounce in less than 80 minutes is really phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). They have managed to realistically transfer their real-life ineptitude to the big screen with a minimum of effort, and I congratulate them for that. <br /> <br /> 5. The first planes of the fingers. A lot of things here for foot fetishists, which I think is a very liberal and highly recommended way to reach sexual minorities. After all, shoe and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's good to see someone out there CARING. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. It's not just a small, modest film about shallow people who engage in hollow relationships while indulging in pointless conversations. No, it is much more than that. It is the light that guides all foolish creatures; the guiding light that dominates the useless lives of several pseudo-artistic aspirants who have just left the film school, and plan to assault our senses with witty nonsense that will hopefully play well in pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to gain the necessary exposure , therefore, a bit of real money for a change, with which they will later hire personalities like Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the saving of this planet and the resolution of ALL the political problems that this world faces. What better way to do it than to do porn at the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made the camera here, as clearly indicated in the final credits, who held the camera while the two were in front of it? They probably hired some passers-by and put the camera in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and see my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Cases From the list of nepotism.
