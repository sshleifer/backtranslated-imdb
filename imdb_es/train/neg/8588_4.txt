Revenge of the Sith begins with a long sequence of action that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then becomes really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and muted machinations that have plagued the rest of the series of prequels . The only thing that improves the procedures is the slowness, and I mean slow, accumulated for what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, everything is fine. Not good. Not even good. But pretty good. This movie is being highly praised because it is not as high as in the previous sequels. Instead, it's just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsaber fight? They are all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and nobody noticed. This will make a lot of money, but thank God it's over, this franchise that was once worshiped has been defeated enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after that, I heard a group of very young children say, wow, that was amazing! But all those over eight years of age murmured the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was a little boring. I just thought that seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. That's what we all said.
