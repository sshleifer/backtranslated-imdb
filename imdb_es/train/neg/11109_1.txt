I'm really surprised that this movie gets a ranking like this! I have not seen such a bad movie in years. Wow, this was a really bad movie. Splatter, it's not enough to describe unnecessary blood scenes (almost funny). If you did not like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... well, this is 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps.! <br /> <br /> I can not tell you about the performance since the script was so terrible. Click all the time. (Why should I write 10 lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == Here comes spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who kills people all the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of murders and nobody notices. Actually, those people are just missing. And there is the good guy who tries to solve the mystery (well, there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning that he is the bad boy) and, as usual, nobody believes him! what a surprise! In the end, he puts on the butcher's clothes and fights until he dies with the killer butcher!
