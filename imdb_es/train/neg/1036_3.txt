Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Without knowing it, your son (Luke Perry) has been working on the antidote all the time. Enter the CIA agent, Olivia d'Abo, and the chases begin with the car of the cat and the mouse and the shooting begins. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an old Roger Moore. Moore seems to have moved reluctantly through this mess, definitely not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but it's good to look.
