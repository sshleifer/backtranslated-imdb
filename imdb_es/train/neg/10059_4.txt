I expected a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I observed a man who regrets the fact that his great-grandfather has lost his tobacco empire with the Duke family. And this went on and on. If Mr. McElwee's family had prevailed over the Dukes, I doubt that Mr. McElwee has any problem with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family started his tobacco business; I expected more than McEwee's continued focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in North Carolina's economy and the ramifications to the state's economy from stricter tobacco regulation. The innumerable references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are out of place. So, what would happen if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's great-grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing clips from old movies from a fictional movie? I did not do it
