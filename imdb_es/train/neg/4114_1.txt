There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? AND WHY DO THE MOVIES MAKE THIS BAD? The premise is absurd. The acting is one-dimensional. The special effects are exaggerated. And the movie is an endless battle between some of the worst shots Hollywood has ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there would be no film. Too bad it was not like that. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stayed with him to see how bad he could be. I'm glad I did it because (SPOILER?) The last line is the stupidity of all the stupid and grim scenery. It is not even worthy of the second state of the property on a third entry drive in the off-season. In addition to how horrible the film is in general, I am deeply concerned about its impact on the young audience. Americans unleash this shit and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is a truly banal cinema on a scale of Brobdingnagian!
