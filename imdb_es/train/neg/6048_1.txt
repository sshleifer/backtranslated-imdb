Even more boring, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say that according to the IMDb guidelines). THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb the European influences, to complicate the conventional vision of the detective of the American police, even if the attempt was frustrated by the ambivalence of Friedkin, the North American and the general direction. The rise of the arthouse (relative) of the 1960s (especially with the nouvelle vague) allowed a great influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This gave a new vigor and complexity to a tired medium, and, in the best of them (for example, BONNIE AND CLYDE, scorcese early), a new subversion of the received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its style hardly distanced and its anti-detective figure. TWO is the reaffirmation of Hollywood's right of American values. <br /> <br /> This is found in the very boring dialectic of the United States against France. For example, DOS is filmed as a French policeman of the 70s. Of course, it was the French who insisted on the greatness of American films when they were ignored at home, and this, in a sense, is a claim, a warning against the Galician presumption. This can be seen in the pattern of the two films. CONNECTION makes French gangsters invade New York, with the French style stifling the American thriller, leading to the dissolution of the figure of the detective and the resolution of the plot: the villain escaped. <br /> <br /> TWO makes the American return to France, with American suspense values ​​imposed on the native genre: the power of the detective is reaffirmed and a conventional resolution is achieved. This is dramatized further in Doyle's relationship with the French inspector Barthelmy, whose dominant influence he must eliminate before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> DOS seems to follow the original by undermining his detective hero. From the beginning, Doyle's importance diminishes with each step. Despite the end of the CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign country, and his inability to control the language or customs means he can not dominate the plot. Even misinterprets the signs of the police force, confuses an informant with a criminal and kills him. <br /> <br /> The power of a detective comes from his power as a subject to see and interpret, but Doyle spends much of the film being watched, controlled, an object, a body (literally in the scenes after which Charnier abandons him) to be seen and interpreted. In CONEXIÓN, he instigated the action, persecuting the criminals, forcing the conspiracy; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, addicted, dependent. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power is predictably symbolized in the loss of his weapon, and the film follows a depressing family oedipal trajectory. In heroin sequences, an old woman comforts him and says he looks like his son. His state of drug addiction is like a return to the uterus, devoid of adult pressure. Taking your watch reinforces the timelessness of this state, doubly significant for a man whose career depends on schedules and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective and, to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother. who is dissolving his unified identity, and kills the father (Charnier) so that he can assume his accepted masculine role in society. The psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70s (ironically instigated by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a film so literally full of it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tended to minimize Doyle, then the style of the film does not. Friedkin separated us from his hero by rejecting the empathy or motivation of the character, focusing on the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of getting lost in a dark plane, it is made known and understandable to the viewer with traditional devices: shots in the point of view, close-ups, connection shots, etc. <br /> <br /> TWO has to do with the Fall and Ascent of Popeye Doyle. The plot in this case is subject to the action, which is the usual usability of Hackman. The cold scenes of turkey, therefore, in spite of their boredom, are not disturbing. We are allowed to share instead of coldly observing; This is a much less uncomfortable experience. The scenes are also recorded with a tearful male sentimentality that is very American. <br /> <br /> Then, while CONEXIÓN tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, DOS does the opposite. LE SAMOURAI de Melville presented a gangster who started the complete, powerful film in an external language and plotted its eventual disintegration. TWO begins with a disintegrated character, achieved in part by the inability of language, whose domain begins when language is exited; the conclusive action sequences have no words. <br /> <br /> In the film, the place and language are important as they corrected and undermined the detective, but as he regains his power (figured in the return of his gun, and the cathartic burning of the primary site of Vulnerability, the block of the tower where Charnier had it), Marseille's configuration becomes more irrelevant, and the mythical confrontation, which could take place anywhere, takes over. Compare the endings of the two films: one admits ambiguity and desperation, the other absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
