The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. Troops are piled on the train, wearing the uniform with which the French Army, including the Legion, marched to war in 1914 ! This is a sure sign that the war movie you're about to see will be a turkey. (The French army realized in 1915 that it was not going to war with red pants and navy blue coats, the French metropolitan troops were put on the "blue horizon" and the colonial troops in khaki.) Claude Van- Damme (sp?) Remake at least got the uniforms more or less well. It really is too bad when the directors make these kinds of mistakes when they then do everything possible to do things right.
