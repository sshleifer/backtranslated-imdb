Tromaville High has become an amoral filth wasteland thanks to the side effects of the accidental release of toxic waste from the nearby nuclear plant. <br /> <br /> An unconstrained chaos full of absurd violence and rude behavior. Rather horrible, obviously meant to be, a mess of a movie with the filmmakers loosening the reins allowing talent without casting to reign freely. Craft was very low on the list of objectives of Troma for this bloody sleazefest. The society of honor are punks with painting works of spooky faces and extravagant costumes. The German teacher who becomes a member, through a "toxic kiss", has the stripes on the side of her face that really gave me chills. However, the toxic monster, which sent the RECOVERY punks towards the end, is pretty cool. br /> <br /> Enthusiasts of the film class will embrace each other with all their hearts.
