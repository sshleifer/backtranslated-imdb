One would think that the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without having to invent things about it. However, this documentary seems to need to throw everything in the most terrifying light possible. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's near-fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had something to do with each other. It causes the problem of computer overload (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence to sound like a catastrophe when it was only a nuisance and not a risk to the crew. And it takes the "thirty seconds" call to thirty seconds of fuel before it runs out, when in fact it's thirty seconds before an abortion is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a documentary or a dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From the Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
