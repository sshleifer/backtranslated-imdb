Just what we need! Another new version of classic Hollywood cinema, with Eddie Murphy knocked down again in his second time after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we are running out of special ideas to make a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its nice and charming image of animals that can act and talk to humans. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. Bath jokes and sexual references kill this piece of "family" fun instantly. Even parents and children saw the announcement of the trailer on The Family Channel, which was followed by great anguish and disgust at the movies. It's sad to say that this is the most progressive era before the millennium, but enjoy it while it lasts because things can only get worse over time. More went wrong with the new DR. DOLITTLE. It's absolutely no plot, it feels too flat. I also hate the irritating voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voice-overs than a group of celebrities who pay too much and who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I'll have to agree that my local newspaper gives this one of the five worst movies of 1998. On the other hand, the original version was not good either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he is not careful!
