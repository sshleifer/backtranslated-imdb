This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie, so if you have not seen any of the two and want to see them, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> Although this is supposed to be about the meeting of Christian and Kathryn for the first time, the film is a bad copy of the first cruel intentions. The actors who played as Christian by Ryan Phillippe and Kathryn by Sarah Michelle Gellar are, in fact, very good substitutes. Nor can you achieve the attitude of a rich and sarcastic child that the original actors did. It is absolutely shocking that part of the dialogue has been literal, not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen carefully you will recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot: if this was really the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? It was assumed that he was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the link to the photograph / comment "You could be a model" in at The end was totally boring and did not add anything. In general, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe that they have made a Cruel Intentions 3.
