Little Tree's education is not as good as it could have been. Little Tree education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you. What happened to the three Rs? Readin '' Ritin 'and' Rithmetic? When the idiot back speaks with the teacher at the boarding school, he starts crying and talking to heaven. Oh my God. Sure, the lady was a bit harsh, but then the character of James Cromwell appears and takes him away, leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right.
