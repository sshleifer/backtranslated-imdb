Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects would have been incredible. A better direction could have had more feelings and better performances from the actors. But nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Draw holes, faulty lines, terrible rhythm, endless repetition of the same shots of a CGI dragon that walks the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
