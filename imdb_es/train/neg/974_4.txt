This movie seemed like it could be entertaining and interesting because of its description. But for me it was a bit disappointing. Very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them into the air and spliced ​​them in the way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). In addition, nothing of any consequence was filmed. I have seen quite a few different Korean films and I have noticed that a good part is well done and requires some reflection on the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one took my breath away. I watched the movie for the second and third time and still did not do anything for me. I still do not understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it were only to show a typical mundane part of a person's life, I suppose it was successful. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
