I saw him last night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly overrated by IMDb fans. The performance was unique but regular. The address did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably: the film has to do with college graduates and the game they play by making prank calls (7eventy 5ive). And besides, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice throughout the movie, you may like it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
