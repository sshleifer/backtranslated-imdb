The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the direction that most of this film takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy who lives in New York in the 50s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people you have in mind? Well, your own mother and stepfather, of course! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, they caught him before he saw anything and sent him over the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and currently they do not sleep together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his partner spend most of their free time with a couple of girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit down and talk about sex. The problem is that ... it is not done in an innocent and charming way from the 50s. NO is a rude attitude, but I found it quite annoying to hear these children talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. That type of rawness can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995) but in this film it seems perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here as Hedy, an old bra model that becomes the object. Of Lenny's fleshly desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far as possible from the director's chair. "For better or worse" (1996) was horrible and now this. What a waste. 1/10
