The film is about a claw at an amusement park where teenagers are on a treasure hunt. As there are no rules, they enter a building and begin to die. The deaths are corny and silent. But at least it had better effects than later sabretear. I gave him a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was fine, but some deaths were off the screen. There was a silly scene in which the two teenagers kiss and sabret's head peeks out and the boy leaves behind his girlfriend, leaving her to have her red guts looking totally fake. Then, the base rises in the vents and bites the children. The final death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics. Even that death was stupid because the tooth of the statues crossed her mouth and hangs there, so it will support and there will be a scene in which a Gothic girl loses her contacts, she does not find them and it seems she does not need them. The movie is idiotic and a waste of time.
