I have rarely been subjected to such nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke from a movie, I shuddered everywhere. Terrible, trite, distorted and full of lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Hitler's famous biographer, Ian Kershaw, was originally to be a consultant for this film. However, he found that the script was so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded that they stop using his name as a source (he was ashamed to think that people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> A scene shows Hitler hitting his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loved animals above people. It introduced the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experimentation. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film turns his Obtaining Iron Cross into a farce, involving bribes. Absolute lies He was awarded for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents that show that Hitler had a sexual relationship with his niece. No one. <br /> <br /> Apart from these, Hitler is represented as a rabid simpleton in this garbage movie. <br /> <br /> If he was even half as ignorant, insane and thick as he was. This movie without meaning as in real life, you would not even know that it ever existed. It does not matter to become the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Go see Downfall and give this place a very broad place.
