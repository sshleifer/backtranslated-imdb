Gene Hackman is taken out of jail by an anonymous government agency that wants him for a murder. Of course, it is true that Hackman has the competent skills for the job. <br /> <br /> However, no one tells you anything, it is given to you as the audience receives information and fragments. That's supposed to be suspense, instead it's annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman carries out the mission, but the breakaway is a mess and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders all the dead to be covered. So everyone in the cast dies and in the end you really do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, almost three hours long and that it was cut short. little bit. Maybe something really got lost in the translation, but I tend to think that it was an act of piety among the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach. And Edward Albert is so wasted here that it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never found out what the federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
