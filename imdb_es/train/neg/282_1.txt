What was an exciting and quite original series of Fox has degraded to streamers. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just for Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers that were ahead in Fox decided that they had to do it. "It refines" the plot. "Within the 3 episodes of the first game of the season, I had lost completely as a spectator ( Not even to see Jessica Alba!) I discovered that the new characters that were added in the second season were too ridiculous and amateur, the new plot was lengthening the continuity and the credibility of the show too much. the second season, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming, where the first season declared that biologically he could not sleep. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (the one Hollywood never gets): If it works, do not do it ruin! <br /> <br /> azjazz
