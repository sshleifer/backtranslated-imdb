Les Visiteurs, the first movie about medieval travelers was really fun. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected turns, funny situations and, of course, a simple absurdity, which would remind him a little of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in large part and the same. time travel. The plot changes a bit, since the characters are now supposed to be seasoned travelers. So jump up and down in the story, without paying attention to the fact that it's still absurd as you go through the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep everything together with his game, but his character has been emptied, so there's not much he can do to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now the Duke's slave / Helper, really has all the attention. The movie is just about him and his clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever it was supposed to be. The truth is; This character tries to produce the laughter of the audience, but does not succeed. It's like someone is telling you a really bad joke, you know, but he insists on telling that joke to the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I guess you still need to watch many movies.
