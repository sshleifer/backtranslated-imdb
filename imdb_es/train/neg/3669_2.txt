I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not a single thing. The script is a nightmare ... the writer blurs the line between the chemical and biological traits and does not seem to understand the difference. One would think that at least they would have a technical adviser. The performances were bad for the majority of the cast ... although I do not really blame them ... the material really sucks. The editing was just as bad ... I'll stop now ... everything is wrong 2/10
