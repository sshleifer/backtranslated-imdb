Seriously, I read some of the criticisms of this movie and I have to ask if they were watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give a lot of credit to the directors established by power to recreate the 1930s Los Angeles vintage, but so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters is nice, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is simply shy. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want the animated version, D'oh!) Then you had the spooky child actor, the spooky Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of Those movies love movies and the rest of us look at each other and say "What the hell!"
