Abysmal with a capital "A". This has to be one of, if not EL, the most unpleasant program on television at this time. I'm almost as anti-bush as it gets, but this program does not even make me laugh. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether you'll like this shit show or not. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil bush has her underwear on her head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!". There's NOTHING funny about that. Is it supposed to be a joke? The ads that were shown in the weeks before the show, which exaggerated, were more fun than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this is not even considered for a second season. I should not even have had a first one.
