<br /> <br /> Looking cheap and ugly, this movie did not even seem to entertain the children in the audience, except for a pretty funny joke about the toilet. Christopher Lloyd is far from his heyday and, in fact, he is quite annoying in this role, although the lamentable excuse for the jokes of the writers does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateur in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable that one compares it with the often brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams at Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
