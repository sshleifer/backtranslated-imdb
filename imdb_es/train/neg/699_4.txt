Probably one of the most blurred, badly performed and badly written slasher movies. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT Five students who are left behind during the holidays closing a bedroom, but someone designs them and starts to kill them. On the one hand, the main suspect is the dark gardener John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or could be one of the five characters. <br /> <br /> ACT It's not bad, it's not so good, apart from Daphne Zungia who dies. too fast and should have been the main heroine, and the rest pretty boring, although Laura Lapinski, the main heroine, sometimes has its charm and in the end you feel sorry for her. <br /> <br /> THE MURDERERS I can not really see why they banned this, the murders seem mostly fake, a man has his hand cut in half at the beginning, which seems really false, but the others are pretty unpleasant as if a girl were hitting her head with a car, a girl boiled alive and another burned alive. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL It's not really a great slasher cou ld been much better
