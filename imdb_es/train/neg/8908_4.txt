This series was the response of CBS networks to the success of Big Valley. It was a 90-minute Western as was the ABC program. While it was an answer, he did not have the things to do it beyond season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem came true and was lost in this program. For example, in one episode, Johnny's eyes stick out with a stick. Surprisingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had completely healed. Along with that, the stories about this were not as strong as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a program that I would not want DVDs on, and frankly I hope they never get published. Think that, because CBS was running out of lots, they reused many familiar configurations. This was one of the last Western series produced by CBS, since westerns were not very popular in the 70s
