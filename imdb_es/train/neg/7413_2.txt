I just finished seeing, I can not say that I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts pretty well, the visual and the atmosphere give a creepy feeling like this kind of movie should be. But everything ends when the first lordi monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the lordi band, they are seriously misplaced in the movie. The monsters of Doomsday with leather jackets and piercings are so 80. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it starts like similar horror movies, people trapped in a hell. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer is presented with some lines for possible reasons, but the lines never come together and end in something more than a disaster. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an interesting start and some positive effects, I thought someone would have taken better care of the product. I wonder if Lord made this movie just to show that his costumes could be scary (except they are not). <br /> <br /> So the film has credibility for the visual effects, I guess the money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to make their monster aliases on stage more frightening.
