This show is painful to see ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, from the ever changing "jobs", boyfriends and cast. It seems that they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but they had no idea what, and they came up with this shit show. They threw her out when she was a teenager, surrounded by twenty-something-thirty years, and put her in mostly adult situations in repeated comedy attempts. Soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and chose people over 20 years to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> The way this program survived 4 seasons surpasses me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" program, and has included it in its evening lineup on ABC Family.
