I bought this on DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to see it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty entertaining piece that contains two completely separate stories. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short and unsatisfying relationships. She literally runs into Brian Kerwin (a normal married man with children) after driving his car in the back of him. After initially being hostile to each other, he offers to take her home because she no longer feels comfortable driving. The romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happened at the end was not prepared, but the slow rhythm and routine of the direction of the television eliminate the drama of the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section involves a former studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the best cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants something from the head of the studio, but in the end, when asked to resign, everyone realizes that their careers will now go nowhere. <br /> <br /> Time passes but it is not so interesting and I am glad that it was not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but it's true that she was the only actress worth watching in this movie and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. However, in general, unless you are a fan of it, avoid this, as it is very routine.
