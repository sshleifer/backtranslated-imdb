It is interesting to see what the director tried to do with this movie. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film and, although the plot was well presented, the main characters were a little shallow and you did not bother with any of them. <br /> <br /> Rather insipid (and, sometimes, frankly) wrong) the photo leaves a lot to be desired, but I guess you can not expect much from people who are making a low budget movie for the sake of do what. It is unfair to review the film and compare it with other high-budget films. But oh, that's what one should do. On its own, it is not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it does not stop having its good points! I liked the plot. It was built quite well and tied well at the end. Sometimes, in the really dark scenes, he also managed to create a spooky feeling. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the film does not impress. The characters are practically nonexistent and we do not care about any of them. Any of them could die, but it is possible to identify the final "survivor" from very early on.
