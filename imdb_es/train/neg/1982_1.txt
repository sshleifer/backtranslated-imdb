Who? What? Where? When? Why? The performance was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I have seen all the actors in this film in better roles. The script was very elementary. At the end of this movie, the story line was tied. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be tied. So you never try to write / direct another movie.
