And how many actors can he represent for his own neurotic and compulsive, super-New Yorker? In this film, Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is fortunately less a direct personification than Kenneth Branagh did in "Celebrity." Now it is an annoying and repetitive story: nebbishy, ​​a neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen in whom he projects all kinds of perfection. Everyone lives in perfect giant apartments in the best neighborhoods of Manhattan, constantly sponsors expensive and exclusive restaurants, during which all the characters tell fascinating anecdotes and discuss the arcane philosophy, there is always a trip to the Hamptons during which the main character Nebbishy dazzles on the sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases, and then, of course, said that the main character feels guilty for his desire for Queen Shiksa, but pursues her anyway, sometimes triumphing, to Failing times, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula, and a proof that Allen is not really a great film artist. He just looks like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20 year old who tries to tell the same old and boring ones over and over again.
