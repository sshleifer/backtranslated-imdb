A previous critic said that the movie is not so bad. What?!?!?! The movie glorifies child abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in that, so let's give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not a full 10? Because the filmography was "agonizing," the child's shock glares were "unrealistic" and the fat friend was "irritating." Nowhere in the review, the critic expresses outrage over the fact that a 1981 American movie featured scenes of a boy who has sex with an adult woman. By chance, I was able to catch this steamed bread while I was staying at a hotel that Showtime had. For me, even if the fat friend had acted like a storm and deserved an Oscar, I would still have to give the movie only 1 star. That Howard TV Hessman starred in the movie at the same time he appeared on WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But do not take my word for it!
