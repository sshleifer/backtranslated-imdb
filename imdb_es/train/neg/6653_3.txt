I just watched this movie, and I must say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her very unnatural lines, and had a very unnatural facial expression throughout the entire movie. Rosanna Munter, who played Petra on the other hand, is something natural. She played her part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple: we have seen it many, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, gets jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up together again at the end. There were no surprises at all, one knew that Eva would separate and that Adam would "get together" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go find Eva at the party. She became very serious, which is an aspect of Petra that viewers had not seen before in the film, and told her to give Eva back her heart, which was really nice. <br /> <br /> Besides Rosanna Munter, there's no I'm not a single actor that offers a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
