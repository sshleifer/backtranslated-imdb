This is exactly the type of Saturday morning series that I loved during World War II. He was less than ten years old. And that is the audience for which this series is designed. Looking at it now, one must roar at his ineptitude and stupidity. The budget must have been almost nil, given the shortcuts and the repetitions. The acting? Well, these are photos of the Republic, 1944. They read the lines ... and they certainly had a single shot to make them convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
