Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, and like in part 4, has no relation to the first three, except for the title and the fact that it is a horror movie with Christmas themes. <br /> <br /> Except for the unconscious, there are some obvious things that are happening here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toy maker named Joe Petto and the name of his spooky son is Pine. A bell rings, someone Now, a boy named Derek heard a knock on the door one night and opened it to find a gift at the door for him. Although he said "do not open until Christmas," he starts to open it anyway, but is stopped by his father, who scolds him, sends him to bed and opens the gift himself. Inside is a small red ball that springs with Santa's arms and head, and proceeds to kill dad. Wow, maybe I should have gone well alone. Of course, Derek is traumatized by the incident since he saw him from the stairs, but he does not become a Santa killer, he just stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto does. We even see him buy a lot when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift for him and get him out of his trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we are not sure, but it seems that he is disarming these toys to see what makes them work. He prevents the owner from evicting him by promising to pay him cash the next day and presents him with a "Larry the Larvae" toy for his son, but, of course, "Larry" is not a good toy and he leaves the house. box in the car and, of course, good, things are not pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, finally what happens with Joe Petto and Pino is revealed, of course, and just like in the previous story, Pino is not. a "real boy" Pine is probably even more agitated and mischievous because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a soft plastic crotch) so he could explain his bad ways. And the identity of the stranger who is hiding is also revealed, and there is even a kind of happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> One step ahead of part 4, but not much of one. Once again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. There are also some left over from part 4, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that does not make any difference. Anyway, now I've seen the whole series out of my system. Now if I could get some of that out of my brain. 4 out of 5
