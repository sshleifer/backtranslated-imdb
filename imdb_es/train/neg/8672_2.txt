Most of the action films are crude of the Hindi cinema, especially Sunny and his family. <br /> <br /> The film is typical of Sunny type with blows, great dialogues and melodrama. <br /> <br /> The movie also has the typical Rajiv. Rai ingredients of many henchmen and a strange villain <br /> <br /> The beginning is fine and then the change to Kenya is good, but then the film goes on and on <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is It moves at a slow pace and nothing happens that is great <br /> <br /> There are many stupid scenes, as Kenyan cops show themselves as pranksters, especially Sharat <br /> <br /> The climax is also prolonged <br /> <br /> Rajiv Rai does a good job Music is fine, only 1 song works and that is the last TOOFAN Camera-work is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as always, Chunky acts like a monkey while his seriousness the scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is fine Heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri is not half as scary as he in TRIDEV the rest is fine
