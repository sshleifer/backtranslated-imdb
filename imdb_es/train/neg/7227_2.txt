While others may claim that by watching other Bilal works, one will appreciate this movie better, it fails in an important way. It does not stand on its own. The plot is a mixture that confuses symbolism with substance. Here is an idea that begins with a definite history. Then he creates a symbolism around him. We start with two different narratives, this female who is somehow becoming human, a "god" who for some reason is being judged, but getting a last adventure on Earth, and this mysterious character of John who seems to be developing some type of "resource". "Just beyond the limits of the city, why?" None of these questions has an answer, but we care, no, there is no development to want us to identify with any character in history, as close as we can get to Jill and even then the development is uneven at best.Unfortunately, the film is caught in the visually stunning set (that is), but at the expense of motivational development.I would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance himself little of the material and not having to feel that each image has to be in the image.
