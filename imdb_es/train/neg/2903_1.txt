Oh darling. This movie could have been subtitled "When the writers go on strike!" What stinks. I had high hopes for this, especially after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me wonder about the entire IMDb classification system, but that is a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc., so I expected great things. To say that I was disappointed is the underestimation of the year. There are so many things wrong with this film, but I will limit myself to (a) the implausibility that ANY family behaves like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? What is the real life planet on?), The script clumsy (a love killer? Please), and the fact that Dan's character is so disgusting, are you wondering what the girl in him saw to make her fall in love? This movie was bursting with awkward dialogues, squeaking directions, ridiculous scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have left after half an hour if we had not been with my parents, who do not go out very much and do not like to spend money. Unlike the creators of this film, who would have been better to throw all the money spent to make this movie a bonfire, that would have been more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid this like the plague.
