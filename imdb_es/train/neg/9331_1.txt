Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. It's a typical DVD / TV movie that includes all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: the excess of acting has been actors, side steps of the plot that remain unexplained, THE GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts (why God, why?), people do not react to things as they would in real life. I'm not even going to bother you with the details, it would take all night. Well, it's okay, just one: if two people were killed in front of you while walking down the street, one of the victims practically dies in his arms, his blood gushes from his wound on his head, it would be his first concern. be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!"? My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
