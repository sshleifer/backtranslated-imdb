Well, I found this movie in my father's old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover, but the movie really was horrible! OK, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took a while to get in, so the kid's story was completely delayed! It was not even scary! His dream sounds like the story of a little boy. Then the one news girls were also completely delayed. I'm sure someone will call the informant and ask him to go out with you. But that ended well when she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and saw him on TV and he told her all that crap. The next one was the beautiful gay story about the guy who brought the dead back ... OMG is so stupid that I'm not even going to say anything else. The last one was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool ... yes, the girl is possessed and kills all her classmates or something like that. Then, when everyone finishes telling their dreams, the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
