I saw this movie in a real movie theater (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and my uncle. We were around 11 and 12 years old, I suppose, and really in scary movies. I remember that I was so excited to see him because my great uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably never do it again!) And very disappointed afterwards! Just boring and not scary. The only good thing I can remember is Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that was not so good, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this has always been in my mind as the worst. This was for what I can remember, one of the most boring, fearless waste of our $ 6 collective, and a waste of film. I've read some of the reviews that say it's worth seeing and I say, "Everyone is yours too," but it would not even bother me. Not even that bad is good.
