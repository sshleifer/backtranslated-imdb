Shame, I rarely see a movie and I feel disappointed in the end. I've seen quite a few adaptations of Ira Levin, 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives', and I liked both, but this just did not appeal to me. <br /> <br /> When I read the scheme of the plot - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to assassinate one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and put together his script for his own success - he was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but everything else. I would say there are LOADS of twists and turns. So many is a bit difficult to explain in detail the plot of the film, without revealing it. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns began to take place, and at that moment my interest and pleasure began to fade. Although I have to give Lumet credit for the fun ending that made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The main cast, Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth, were all brilliant in their roles. Although the fake and obvious Russian accent of Worth bothered me a bit (no Irene staff, I think the false accent of any actor would irritate me). I'm not sure if Cannon's character was meant to be annoying, but Dyan managed to annoy him and entertain him at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this: I do not want you to be discouraged to see this because from my points of view, give it a chance, you may like it, maybe not. It is about opinion.
