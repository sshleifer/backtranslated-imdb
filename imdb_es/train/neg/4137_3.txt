I have a high tolerance level for garbage, so I expected this. He did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, she follows a father and daughter hunting a vampire who luckily travels with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the General, as he likes to be called here) running randomly over zombies. Did I mention that there was an outbreak of zombies? The dead are coming back to life but nobody seems too worried. We have zombies of construction workers, zombies soldiers and even zombies of schoolgirls of St. Trinian. Apparently, Santa is looking for his daughter who has become a vampire. Oh, wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in an asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, is not she? The zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like a simulated cunnilingus to make the juices flow. When are we going to see vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the zombies of San Martin. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires. I guess the zombies won, do not they? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
