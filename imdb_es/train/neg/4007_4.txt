I hope that whoever has trained these losers in their accents has been fired. The only high points are some of the secondary characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were eliminated at the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put that in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story focuses on sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with heterosexual vampires, sex for vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex with vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we are afraid of vampires, sex because we are angry with vampires, sex because we become vampires, etc. <br /> <br /> Nothing against sex, it would be good if it were a little more subtle when cast in history. Maybe HAVE a plot and then have some sex. But they did not even bother to do that ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy bitch. Either she sucks or her character sucks, I can not figure out which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the story that I find highly implausible is why the 150-year-old vampire, Bill, who seems to have his stuff together, would be interested in someone like Sookie. She is constantly losing control of him over things he can not control. She leaves for two days and she already decides that she "will not return" and suddenly has feelings for the dog-man? Give me a break. She is supposed to be a 25 year old woman, not a 14 year old woman. People close to her are dying everywhere, and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her V-card to some guy because she can not read her mind. As the main character in the story, I would have expected the program to do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest her interest in, not someone you secretly wait for, who kills herself or puts herself in a coma. I can not find anything about his character that I like and even the fact that he can read minds is incredibly uninspiring and not the most interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time watching season 2. June comes.
