I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense since most zombie movies have their place there. From the "Dead" trilogy of Romero to "28 days later". However, when you watch it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more bloody. There is no horror here people. Just some decently organized half-way action scenes that soon get boring because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling that maybe a DVD player skipped 3 minutes, but no, that's how they really made the movie. It's a shame. I think anyone could find a better use for $ 7 million dollars in the film industry than making this lump or 'crud'. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were great, once again, they were used excessively and became tedious, since it was the same trick again and again each time, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what is REALLY annoying is the splicing of the arcade game images. I played the game. It stinks Then, why did they put it here? Oh, that's right, this is not a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R: a lot of violence / blood and profanity
