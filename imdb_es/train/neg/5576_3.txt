To this day, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people will not talk about Rashomon, or the Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses, Japanese cinema means all those monsters that we have fallen in love with, destroying those Japanese cities over and over again, often in battles with each other. The first and the largest of these is Godzilla, who returned a dozen times or more, and in some films he faced the three-headed hydra as a monster from outer space, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, according to the times, special effects improved a bit. But part of the charm of those old movies was to see how the paper sets of the city of mach√© were destroyed, they looked so fake, maybe three steps over Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some future visitors have traveled to Japan to urge them. Godzilla is destroyed from the first time it was discovered. And in fact, it was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when it protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from those American troops. But later, with the atomic tests in Bikini, Godzilla, the cute dinosaur, like Barney, became the mean machine we've learned to know in the movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, you eliminate Godzilla more than Ghidrah. ruin Japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was in 1991 when the movie came out. I will not say more, but we all know that Japan is doing quite well in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all the other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
