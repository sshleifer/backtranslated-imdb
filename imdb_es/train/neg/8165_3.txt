It is a ghost story. It is a story of cannibalism. It is a story of revenge. It's a very bad movie with a lot of violence. I suppose it continues cheaply throughout all the Slasher movies you've seen. It has the usual isolated place, the arrogant campers, heading towards the desert. Of course, there are some pretty intense scenes. It is so boring Mala edition and all the work. There are ghost children who sound like they're talking in a trash can. I'm not really sure what rules ghosts play and the psychopath with the seed cap. It also has the crude scene where a man eats a piece of meat that is actually what is left of his wife. Once, a friend of mine asked me why it is necessary to show this type of gratuitous and unhealthy violence. I'm afraid it's just one more step in our desensitized evolution. Three is no cunning here, no tongue on the cheek, just a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; small plot.
