This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen without a doubt. The only interesting thing in this movie are the appearances of some of the great genre directors and King himself. The movie has a great premise, but it collapses about 15 minutes into the story. I liked Madchen Amick in this movie and I think she could have a very good career in film.
