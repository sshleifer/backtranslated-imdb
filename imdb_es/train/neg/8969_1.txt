The plot does not offer any new emotion, it even starts the same as the cube I. This time there are no other improvements to the cube's machinery, except to have an additional exit, which is not protected, very ingenious. The characters are not as well elaborated as in the first episode, they simply became "flat" as in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone comes to the normal exit, the person will be asked some questions, such as "do you believe in God?", is not really creative or original, and especially in my opinion does not. Fit in the mystery of the cube with its traps. There really is nothing more to say about it.
