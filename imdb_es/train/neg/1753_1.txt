The writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I looked forward to seeing this film and discovering more about his life. The words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was disjointed ... it provided no background on his life, no historical context and nothing about his great writings (except a brief and fleeting reference to "The Cost of Discipleship" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the United States) and relaxing with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he defends his faith. Instead of emphasizing that, we get a very misunderstood romance with a 17-year-old student. Whether it was produced or not, it should not have been an important part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narration that explains what his writings were about ... or SOMETHING to let us know a little of this man's greatness. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... waiting .... ZIP. Nothing This is the kind of movie that gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All they had to do was establish a structure for the film to follow, with some background ... even voiceovers, or flashbacks to him preaching from his works ... some narrative about who he was and where he had been. But no ... this is what we have. Just fit for a hero of faith.
