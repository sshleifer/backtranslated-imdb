Ah yes, the science fiction channel produces yet another abominable movie. I was especially captivated by the scenes that followed the crash, where the survivors desperately searched for matches. At least half a dozen fires burned? for no apparent reason? In several points of the remains. Fire seemed to be a predominant theme everywhere. They searched for corpses in search of lighters and matches, and finally, when they found a box, they started a fire every day, apparently for 12, but nobody gathered wood. Then, when the vegana (ha) burned the bodies, what did she use for an accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen? Well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature, the whole yeti ate, bled. Maybe it's just me, but even in a totally incredible story (none of the survivors had heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the end), if you take care of the little things, the bigger offers become more acceptable Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, hot enough to hold in his hand, froze and did not fire. Give me a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently charming Canadian girl. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I could also add that the rabbit they ate (although it looks like a chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now, if it had been a squirrel (or a rat), it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the writers lacked the real opportunity for someone to write "It tastes the same as ..."
