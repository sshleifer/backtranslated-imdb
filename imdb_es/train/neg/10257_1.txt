This film had a great cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres, all the actors in the film. But this part of the film did not take advantage of any of them, since none of his characters met on the screen (although Christopher Lee can play in front of him in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for the extraterrestrials in this movie seem to change in the blink of an eye. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then activate the main character by killing most of their friends and not releasing his wife after he gives them the crucial part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides that they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (although they offer the main character and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spent watching the man and woman driving, walking or standing or sitting at desks doing nothing. You almost wish they had left with the rest of the planet at the end, only in revenge for having bored us to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like Chris Lee or the low budget science fiction of the seventies, I would give this one a chance. It falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
