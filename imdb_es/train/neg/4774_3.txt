I'm not sure if the filmmakers were looking for a Saw or 12 Angry Men movie (people who put the facts together to get the truth). Whatever it was, it was badly done and it was not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I do not watch movies for blood and blood, but because this movie had little more than what I had done, I should have shown the real murder. More. Most were off camera, minimizing the horror we were supposed to feel for the deaths. <br /> <br /> It also bothered me that the policeman was among the victims; unknowingly, he helped the young innocent man go to jail by accepting the evidence (given by MJH) to the evidence room. (And would not MJH be a prosecution attorney, would she have had access to that evidence (eliminating it and returning the wrong evidence) anyway, so she would not have needed the help of the police?). The others, although they often did not realize that it was this particular person they were harming, still played more important roles in their ultimate demise. The arms dealer should have known that his weapons would be used for evil purposes. The type of insurance rejected a person obviously in need, etc. But the policeman's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have gone a step further and made him the one who encouraged MJH to plant the tests, which would have made him more guilty. And the screams of MJH that he (the policeman) got her into that mess makes no sense. <br /> <br /> It would be more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered others a clue. why he / she was there and deserved to die. The type of insurance, for example, could have had the requests he rejected stuck in his throat so he choked on them; the oriental woman could have had her eyes ripped off because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent than the death of weapons, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not clever, there were no turns, and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've seen. The ending throughout removed me three stars from my rating. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially given the garbage lines and the motivation with which they had to work. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a waste of time.
