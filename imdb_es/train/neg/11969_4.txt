If you like to be entertained, do not go to see this movie. If you like to see heroics of war, do not go see this movie. If you like to see a good performance and an excellent script, do not go to see this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war movies that end just in time to make a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, SEE THIS MOVIE. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I believe that, if they are done well, they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a group of boys running through the countryside, saying sordid clich√©s, making things more predictable and defending the oppressed with the same force and brutality that was given to the oppressed. This movie is a disgrace for the cinema and for the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or from any other country and see this, to be told that this is what Americans really are like? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, do not waste your time on this garbage; If you must, wait and rent it. 4/10
