I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a home movie painfully boring. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy your other movies ... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from this one. You can change your thoughts about Adam. It is possible that he never recovers from the horror that is this movie ... I had a better time watching the old ones play scrabble in a house .......
