This was one of the worst movies of all !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the whole movie! The plot was so corny; especially the end. This movie goes from being a disaster of the end of the world to saving the eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for eels! And there was a horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who got divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mother, my sister and I could not finish it, and when we did, it was about a year later! The second time we saw it and finished it this time, we made similar comments to MST3K throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: just look at this if you're a movie buff! Make funny comments, look at this in a sleepover for laughter, and I mean HUGE laughter. Also be careful with teasing. The metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of puppets of socks and cheeses!
