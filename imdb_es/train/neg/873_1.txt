An executive, very successful in his professional life but very incapable in his family life, meets a child with down syndrome, who escaped from a residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and the less intelligent at the same time will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument, the atmosphere somewhat similar to Amelie and sentimental music, I expected nothing more than a The disgusting moralist film. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the guy is sometimes a very violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasque Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. French cinema, in general, has the capacity to show something that seems quite like life, in opposition to the most stereotyped American cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the final absurdity, with the impossible death of the child, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the boy. Greeting from the sky like Michael Landon ... Really unpleasant, in my humble opinion.
