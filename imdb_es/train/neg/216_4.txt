I do not like sick love as much as the image. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship of Alex, Kik, Sandu and his triangular love was full of intensity, frustration and envy. At last, Alex woke up and realized that they would not have results and future. Finish was sad. <br /> <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC theater on Sunday at 12:00 p.m. of 08/10/06, with us watching the movie together. After the movie, he told the audience that the purpose of creating this film which was to express the Romanians' sexual relations was somewhat complicated. <br /> <br /> In my point of view, sex life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any particular impression and effect of the film. The love of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were a kind of neighboring story. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why I do not like this movie are, first of all, that the movie did not tell us how they started falling in love? It seems that after Alex moved to the building where Kiki lived, two girls fall in love. It does not make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you need to create images and connect those stories with your mind. Secondly, the whole movie did not have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual relationship, that's what I was waiting for. However, I still had some parts that I deserved to recommend. The "piercing of the ear" part was interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of piercing his ears to appreciate Kik's love. That was a moving scene that gave you a little idea of ​​your love. In addition, the scene in which they lay on the football field, the conversation about how to express their love was sincere and passionate.
