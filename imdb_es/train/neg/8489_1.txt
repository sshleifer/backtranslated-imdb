Yes, in 35 years of filming, I've finally seen the stench that surpasses all the other gruesome movies I've seen. Beat 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'out of pure misery. This is a pretentious blige of the first order ... not even entertaining pretentious squat. The effects are cheap and, what is worse, meaningless. <br /> <br /> The script seems to have been written by a first year film student who does not go out very much but wants to appear full of portents. The performance is simply indescribably bad: Tilda Swinton leads a career full of wooden voids with a performance that turns neurotic between a ridiculous and comic 'intensity'. Apparently, some fools have allowed the director of this movie to do another ... be warned
