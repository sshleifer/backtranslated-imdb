I just watched this movie last night, and I HAD to put a warning so that someone else is considering watching this movie. In a word - do not do it. Honestly, I feel that this is something a scriptwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is, every other word was a curse. I have no problems with profuse curses, as in "Good Will Hunting", as long as it helps to delve deeper into the characters. In this case, it was just an empty joke with the intent to provoke an occasional gasp or laughter from the audience. The three main characters are all their own unique stereotypes, the imbecile Wall Street, the moron of the cafeteria and the "I'm not gay, I'm just in touch with my feminine side," a little less. in one go. You just do not care about any of them! All of them are superficial and irredeemable losers to those who WANT to see lose. For those who dare, this movie has a couple of fun moments, the beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a sick species "Uh, yeah". Although really, I would only recommend this movie to my worst enemies.
