Well, first of all, let me tell you, I'm still amazed at how the plot sucks, but again it's a film that sequels a Steven Segal movie without Steven Segal OMG !!! <br /> <br /> only low-budget random action scenes really do not matter. I'm still surprised that I burned 90 minutes in this real shit !! <br /> <br /> just rent a movie from Jacky Chan or go to see wwf more fun and has no and presumes not to have and plot! Please, please, please, avoid it! By the way, the best actor is Bill Goldberg and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> and it does not play very well as I said, please, avoid it. I still can not believe I lost 90 minutes and spent. 10 more minutes writing this! :)
