Anyway, that's the title it should be. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives and mindless killings to make a flop from an "action" movie. Let me present my point in a series of questions: type of response to treatment. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die <br /> <br /> Is that it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point that the film tries to make? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> How are the characters? Extremely defective and contradictory with their own personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good in this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some good Panavision cameras to film it. <br /> <br /> If you like constant killing and greed, watch the movie. If you feel rejected by such low "entertainment", then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> In short, the plot stinks, the characters are not worth it. , the story is completely resistant, and nothing fits. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, the directors and those who helped make this film are certainly not "done".
