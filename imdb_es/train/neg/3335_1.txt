This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of all, and it is a positive proof that a five minute fable is not a long film. Poor Sid Caesar, like the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to see him. Like the cunning tailor, Robert Morse has not a hint of charm. Neither his hapless nephew (Jason Carter) The "songs" are terrible and only slow down what there is of the plot. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the secondary characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is pretty like the Emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the smaller players. And the film crawls with snails. Hans Christian Andersen must have been circling in his grave when this appeared. Honestly we can say, at least of this story of the film, it is not surprising that it has gone directly to the oblivion of the video.
