So it has come to this. Fast and expensive cars that only the top 1% will ever drive. The girls who pose next to them in gearhead magazines. Actors of second level and without name. Cheap promotional appearances by people of niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong I love the nonsense action movie with hot girls as much as with the next guy. But, please, does the collective Braintrust that gives green light to these things stop, counts to ten, breathes, has a plentiful "Woooooosaaaaaah", then rewinds twenty-five years and remembers what made the movies enjoyable once ? So in fact DO some movies like that again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of pop culture that you have enjoyed in the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think that now they are their Maverick (not even half of them will get that reference). One executive said, "Hey, what demographics do you want to filter $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, the 18-35 market." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, sir." The result? A film that I've seen a hundred times late in the night on Spike TV, and most of the time, starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. Exaggerated art films like The English Patient do not float my boat, but generic movies that should not even have been made directly on DVD also bother me. Only teen gearboxes will have their engines accelerated by this, and I imagine that those at the upper end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a scrap yard.
