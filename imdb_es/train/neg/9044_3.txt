I really wanted to like this movie, but a lot of it is stolen / borrowed from another job, part of the loan is painfully flagrant. The New York Times review pointed out that its singing frog terribly recalls that of the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello my love", hi my ragtime girl ... ") But I challenge anyone to see Robots (2005), an animated film by Fox / Blue Sky, and do not find ridiculous similarities in: plot: a young inventor who grows and a single innovative company distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> Urban landscape: angles of extremely similar cameras that capture very similar futuristic urban environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - The servant robot in the Robinson house has a design very similar to that of robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic appearance. <br /> <br /> All this seems to be in clear contradiction with the disgusting Disney appointment at the end, implying that the company has been a constant innovator who never looks back (what It also contradicts all its movie catalog ulas in the 90s that were pretty clones with each other, with some small changes in the plot and ethnic origin). <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak for itself, and instead we constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we do not have the capacity of attention for anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brightly animated, and it's a pleasure to see him. Much of the rest of the film seems put together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie starts with a classic Mickey Mouse short. At the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that Disney never had much interest in innovating or telling good stories, as they seem to think that simply having something on the big screen is enough proof of its virtue.
