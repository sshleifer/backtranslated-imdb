Spike Lee has to be one of the most overrated directors I've seen. He is the favorite of critics because he supposedly makes movies with a "message" or is so bohemian in his approach that makes critics who are flooded by the Hollywood formula eat their things just for being different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam does not even do it well. The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is very similar to "Doing the right thing". The portrait of "Guidos" or for the set of Italian-American PCs (of which I am one) is taken directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Just the impression of Eddie Murphy that an Italian macho male was fighting with a much taller African American is much more credible than the Italian cartoon cartoons shown here (the character of John Leguizamo is a possible exception). <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who has seen this movie who has not been able to figure out how it would end? As soon as Richie entered the movie, he could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, he could already see him accused of being the killer. This character had the highest integrity in the whole movie, so of course, Lee will show what happens to the people who stand out from the crowd (what a white clique with a beard!) <br /> <br /> Somebody, please, Give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to every basketball game he wants. So, maybe he will be having too much fun to acquire a film camera for a long time and we will not have to submit to his own nonsense and, besides, I will not have to see critics (some of them whom I respect) ohhhh and Ahhhh to an emperor without clothes.
