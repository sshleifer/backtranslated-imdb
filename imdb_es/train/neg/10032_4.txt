The plot was fine. Akshay Kumar was fine as always and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so much nonsense and crying about her size zero, but she did not look much thinner. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There was not much to do for him in the movie. The fact that it is a Yashraj film does not mean that an actor must accept the role no matter how bad it is. He said Ali Khan was fine. I think it is time for the directors and producers of India to start thinking of Indian customers as a smart lot. What are we ? Fools!!!! What they think, they will show 2 men taking a SWAT squadron to wobble and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to catch some criminals? ... they take a full squad of more than 100 policemen and there was no one to surround the palace. The action was crap and I have never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was among a circle of 30-40 policemen who shot him ... and he shot them. No police bullets touched him, but he killed all the cops. Shit. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the fight director who thought about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend NOT SEEING THIS MOVIE.
