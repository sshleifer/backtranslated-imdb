Robert Taylor definitely proved to be an excellent dramatic actor in his role as a buffalo hunter in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times that Taylor played a heavy role in a movie. However, this image was far from great, shortly after this, Taylor fled to television with the hit series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and became a formidable acting partner for Taylor. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a fan here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as a veteran and veteran drinker who joined the buffalo hunt as well. In his first scenes, Nolan was really making an excellent takeoff from Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Mother Mother's Treasure in 1948. Notice the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan would join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The writing on the film is, at best, rigid. At the end of the movie, it's the elements of nature that made Taylor. What about the elements of writing here?
