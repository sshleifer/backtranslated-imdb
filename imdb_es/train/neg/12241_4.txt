This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an indisputable error in his narration. While handling Ralphie's situation, Christopher claims that he has heard of Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. However, there is no way that Chris has heard of the accident. Who should I have told him and when? The moment he is ripped from his delirium by Tony's call, no one else was informed. Tony knows it, which makes it even worse! Listening to Christopher talk about Pie-O-My's death, therefore, could only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set fire. Given the writing process as impressive as the same writers on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them noticed the problem there. The story simply does not work that way. It is not necessary to add that I am a big fan of the Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly would not mind.
