The muscular ape-man in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; The nice daughter of the team leader finds him first. The version of the tale of Tarzan, which is very successful, has a good production, but is paralyzed by the worst direction of a movie I've seen in my life. John Derek is devoid of inspiration beyond the cheesy action in slow motion and the furtive glances of the naked body of wife Bo Derek; He has as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Trying to achieve ironic sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, agile rhythm and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and brave abandon (they throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who possibly had marbles in his mouth all the time) has the main role, but plays a secondary role in the ego of John Derek and in the sense of personal importance of Bo Derek. * since ****
