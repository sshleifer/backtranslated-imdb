This movie sucks! You will want to return to the more than two hours it takes to go through. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda try to do MUCH better. That movie was intelligent, witty and well acted. I did not care what happened to both Gwyenths, or rather to the characters he played, and the performances of the cast were fantastic. <br /> <br /> When Melinda and Melinda are tedious, the dialogue is witty and I could have cared less about these people, and less Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional (her first glass of wine at 10 a.m.) and so melodramatic that it is ridiculous, and not in the comical sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine, but it's forgettable. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because, I suppose, he spent time in the script and the actors had talent. An important part of this film is that he wrote this script in two months: it can be said. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented, those around her are not, they are not enough to be a complete presence. The film ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a group of other people that you know you've seen in other movies, but I do not remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
