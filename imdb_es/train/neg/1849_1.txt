I was interested to see the movement thinking it could be a diamond in the rough, but all I found was bad writing, a horrible direction (shooting sequences do not flow) although the director could say that is what it is. looking, it seems very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the action was low budget video. I would say that it was not even something as simple as a digital mini video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to arrange a movie with what the director has, such as through editing, etc. But it's obvious that he just does not care. There is so much effort put into this movie as a ham sandwich. It could be improved, but that would mean extra work.
