If you want to see a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2 : The Berlin Decision "is a horrible movie. Horrid production values. Horrible acting Horrible script I would not recommend that this movie be seen by anyone seriously believing that this type of trip is quality entertainment or promotes the consciousness of Asian Americans in Hollywood (this movie either.). <br /> <br /> At the very least say that this movie is a passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever find it while navigating the channel. If you're curious, maybe it's a Netflix rental, but this movie is definitely not for keeping it. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who saw this movie as a means to increase your cinematic awareness in Asia and the United States. , and he was disappointed, then I recommend the following films for his personal viewing. These are well written films with high production values ​​that feature a talented cast of Asian-American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
