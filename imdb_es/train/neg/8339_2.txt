This movie only goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought ... mmmmm, it could be a good movie, but it goes on again and again, and in the end you do not know what's happening. The protagonist is a good actress and played her role well, and the psychopath, is creepy, but after a while you do not care what happens, because this movie simply goes on. Real shame, this could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Although I would say that the leading woman and the main psychopath will have a good race ahead, but they will remember this movie for making it known, or for being the movie they regret having never made.
