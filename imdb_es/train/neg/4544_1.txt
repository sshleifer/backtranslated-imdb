This movie simply is not worth your time. His confidence in New Age mysticism serves as his only semi-interesting distraction. The plot has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> They only asked me to take the time to post a comment when I noticed that some have tried to shore up the reputation of this lies. Their motivation and objectivity are doubtful, since they encourage you not to look at the flaws of the films, but the well-intentioned message of New Age consciousness. Or will Islamic fundamentalists bring positive ratings about movies / television that support their views? In spite of the bad qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historical bases? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the fans will come right after me to say flowery things about this movie, despite the truth.
