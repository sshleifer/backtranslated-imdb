Honestly, I was disappointed with the "Due Date". Super smart title and interesting premise, but I do not think it would be fulfilled. What was the main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. However, I was not configured as someone who has lived his life with fear; it seems that his life was going well, but as the day of the final judgment approaches, he should begin to worry. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not seem to have needs that merged into a general story. Everyone was doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. In addition, what was treated as a "curse" seemed more a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I loved the shots of Seattle, the cinematography was beautiful, the performance was good in the times when it was not outstanding.
