This should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-star as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols directing. Uhhh It's boring boring boring! Useless and predictable! Slow and out of focus! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter: the boy knows the girl, the boy marries the girl, the boy has an affair, the girl leaves the boy's story. Now there is an original concept! After twisting for two hours (were they just two?) I felt like six. I was not sure it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago that we'd rather forget. I hope that the damage to the reputation of Streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion of the teacher is beginning to fade. It's not that it's such a bad image. It's just that it's so bad.
