This rarity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION really does not need to be included since it's only in the movie for less than 30 minutes. However, what she does is shine when she is on the screen. The film almost without plot is just an excuse to show some of the players hired by Warner of the day. JANCIE RULE is promising and it's a shame he has not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN manages the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if this was in color. Travis air force base locations with some back projection work well. The best of the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you have enjoyed THANKS TO YOUR STARS OF LUCKY and Hollywood CANTEEN, you will like this one.
