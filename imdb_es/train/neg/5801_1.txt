Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist who investigates the inexplicable. Travel to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> Your car stops and takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful and mysterious girl. Suddenly, she becomes a demon and he kills her, and the city wonders who murdered this woman ... who I think was the witch but I'm not entirely sure. Ivan is being chased by his spirit, or something like that, and he has to have faith, or something, to defeat him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. In general, they are full of lame actors, stupid stories and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but also a foreign one. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrifying, because he is very sharp and whiny. You will not miss much if you miss this movie.
