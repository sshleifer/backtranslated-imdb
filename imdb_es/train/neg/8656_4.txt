This is the first revision of non-zombie subgenres made, but it's worth doing a review for this movie. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it's still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought that the film itself needed a bit more weight than action and violence because every time the crocodile is shown or is at the scene of a fight, not much happens, except the crocodile and the crocodile kills o Runs in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus point and the performance was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the crocodile looked fleshy instead of as a cartoon of the curse * of the komodo * cough. I enjoyed this film enough to rejoice that there will be a sequel that is more than I can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.
