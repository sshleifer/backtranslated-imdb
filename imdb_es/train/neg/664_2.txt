I do not like remakes very much, or steal the modern lingo "recounts", but this movie really infuriated me. The original Prom Night, although not in my humble opinion a masterpiece, still realized what it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspense is crucial to maintain the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle movie was not like that! The scars were cheap, and announced terribly. (A good example of fear that has been made to over cliché now is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon after, but now with an unexpected appearance by the villain of the movie) This movie could not succeed. So how can I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of the horror movie? There must be a hero or a nice heroine. This movie does not have one. The person I most identified with was the chief detective. His calm attitude, but the sensible approach to escape from a murderer was what more movies of this kind should have. Common sense approach to the events that occur. (If you're running away from a psychopath with an ax, you turn and run in the opposite direction.) You do not run, as you look back three seconds, recording the murderer's progress, only to trip over each branch and inanimate object in your path). If your friend disappears, you will not look for them alone. And if you suspect foul play, tell someone, do not investigate. These clichés are tired and overrated. In the horror genre in general, and in this particular movie.
