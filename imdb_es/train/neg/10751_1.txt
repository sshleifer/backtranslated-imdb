Why did I waste my money on this the last day of Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I get back my $ 16? While I was watching this movie, I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way to know what was supposed to read the plot, which was not really like the movie. Why did the director zoom with his useful camera and then zoom? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? Why when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt that Phantom Love had no story, and to be honest, I felt that my friends' holiday videos had an entertainment value much higher than this movie.
