This movie has the appearance of a film project for students. Yes, there are some interesting editions and shots (although novel), but the final result was youthful. <br /> <br /> The director did not seem to be saying "Watch this movie". It seemed as if he was saying, "Look at me! I'm a DIRECTOR!" <br /> <br /> Thumb down.
