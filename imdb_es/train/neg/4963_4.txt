It turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old who thought it would be amazing to have a crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they left for the inheritance in what seems to be the ship in which Christopher Columbus sailed! When they reach Heorot, (which is supposed to be a Nordic mead room), the group of sci-fi idiots decided to make Heorot look like a big stone castle. When I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction has yet to produce a good movie, so I do not know why I have high hopes. Oh ... and Grendel and her mother, they're stupid too. (this comment is off topic about "Grendel") If someone from the science fiction channel is reading this ... there is good advice. NOT EVERY MOVIE YOU MAKE YOU HAVE TO BE ABOUT A GREAT MONSTER THAT YOU CAN DELIVER TO PEOPLE IN HALF, IT IS NOT WHAT THE FICTION OF SCIENCE IS! AND ALSO, LET CASTING LOW-GRADE ACTORS, LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN, TO BE IN THEIR MOVIES! IT IS NOT HELPING THE MOVIE, BUT MAKING IT SMALL!
