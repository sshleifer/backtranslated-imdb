Writer / director Peter Greenaway consolidates his title as Great Lord of Art House's claim with his last unpleasant self-indulgence exercise, 8 ½ Women. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son in their mutual pursuit of sexual satisfaction, while attracting and blackmailing women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think in any way possible that This premise may be offensive and it is likely that Greenaway did. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists. There's Mio, obsessed with Kabuki, the always pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who has something for farm animals. Giulietta does not have legs and uses a wheelchair, she is the "half woman", do you understand? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if this is not the case, what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticize everything that has to do with Japan, a continuation of the themes of its snore. - Worthy (but less sexist) film from 1996, The Pillow Book. But where the pillow book was erotic and elegant, 8 ½ women simply get horny and exploitative. Greenaway's work is insipid and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person who will enjoy seeing it is the author himself.
