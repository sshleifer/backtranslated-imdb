Seeing this stinking is a cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of Sandler. Truly a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> 'I bought the DVD in the $ 5.88 container at Wal Mart. But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is: "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgivable part of the film is that the boat DOES NOT FEEL! <br /> <Br /> Best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know that program on the SciFi channel in which a guy and his muppet machines cheat the most incomprehensible horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, turn off a comedy show and present this movie. Without a good humorous parody of this train crash, I'm afraid that the spectators can really start following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
