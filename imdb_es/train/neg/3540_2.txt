Guy Richie's third feature film (not to mention the gruesome "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller related to gambling, mobsters, and chess.) Fans of Richie's previous efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I do. With his twists and turns, Richie, the stalwart Jason Statham, plays Jake, a recently released ex-convict, to take revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (an extraordinarily OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets involved in a couple of Other cons (one of which is Andre 3000), rap team Outkast) that threw him and us into the public, a series of false leads throughout the film, all of which becomes extremely tedious. The climax of this movie mess is the part in the restaurant, where the dialogue turns in favor of a slow-motion shoot-out and superbly set in Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. In short, Revolver is a faulty job, it's not really horrible, but it's far from being Richie's best. That would be Lock, Stock. If this movie was a school assignment, I would be qualified to 'try harder!'
