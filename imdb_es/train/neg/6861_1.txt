My first exposure to the Templars and not a good one. I was excited to find this title among Anchor Bay Video offers, which has brought us other cult classics such as "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can not hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an exciting opening sequence in which the villagers demand a terrible revenge against the Templars (and they set everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, heavy and, ultimately, unsatisfactory. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised in the video jacket.
