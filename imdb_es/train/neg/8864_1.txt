After seeing this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (this has happened over time). This movie was absolute trash. First, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howling", with an incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot stinks and the whole movie is just horrible! A brother of a werewolf victim of the first movie (by his appearance, it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone) joins Lee and another woman to destroy the werewolf group, led by Sybil Danning, who appears to be naked. all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money observing nudity). Try to catch it in the cable instead. It would be so choppy that it could really make sense.
