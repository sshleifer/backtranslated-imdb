Let me start by saying that this does not seem or feel like a movie. It seems that only another television show about popular girls and boys without a real cinematic language supports it. <br /> <br /> The angles of the camera are so direct that the story is told in the simplest way possible without making it public. connect with her This film takes us to where no film I have seen before: to a kingdom where the Cinema Theater becomes a warm medium that gives the audience all the elements of interpretation. Very obvious The big cinema screen is only used as an enlarged television from where we can see each attribute of these women in a bigger way than life. <br /> <br /> Lately, it seems that young directors are compromising the art of making films for sales. This is very scary. The industry is ruining art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language really are. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch pad for young divas and athletes.
