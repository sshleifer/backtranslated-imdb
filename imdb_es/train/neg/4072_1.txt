I see bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent everywhere. <br /> <br /> I'm LAZY. <br /> <br /> Usually, I see a bad movie and a curse. This was so bad, I actually did a review to try to save others from the completely boring mess that I was a victim of. <br /> <br /> I'm breaking my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> He's too lame even to use a clear room. Very boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, Shock, Shock' in search of absolute garbage that has some merit as entertainment. This mud looks horrible, it's horrible, and whoever did it should feel horrible.
