What can I say? I'm a secret fan of the action and horror movies 'over the top'. Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three possible draws in this movie: ?? The comedy of the situation; ?? The horror; Y ?? The novelty of being hundreds of snakes of an airplane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not written as an ironic horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile. If you want to get the feel of the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Second, if you are expecting a movie full of action and surprises, you will not be disappointed. . "It does not stand out above other films, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does not go out of fashion, but you will leave the cinema thinking" what was it all the uproar of ". <br /> <br /> I know that this movie has a high rating, but it does not add up A) Many of the reviews where they were written before the movie was released and, B) The breakdown of the ratings of users have a much lower than normal variation, 77% of people rated the movie 10/10, with only 7% of the people who rated it 9/10 - Why such a huge gap?
