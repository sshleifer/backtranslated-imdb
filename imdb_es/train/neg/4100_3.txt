A bit disappointing about a movie, I would say: the performance was forced, somehow. In many cases, I simply could not feel that the facial expressions matched the spoken words or the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character must make the viewer believe he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). That does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The comment about the writers, assuming that you already know that the characters were apt. They do things and say things that come out of nowhere: the character that Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals at dinner; then he explodes and runs off, telling his father "Do not touch me, fuck!" Maybe, if we had seen the prequel, we would understand where all of that comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are at sea in terms of reason! <br /> <br /> A strange and peculiar thing that Andrew does is go to an old stone quarry, sit on the edge overlooking the "still water" that lies below; Then he reaches into his jeans pocket and takes out a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times during the movie; I suppose we're supposed to see this as a tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It could even have been four times, I lost the account. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he recently discovered that he was adopted; This happens very early in the movie, so there is no sense in any dramatic change you may be experiencing due to this discovery. It is not really clear if that is why it is so bitter or if it is something else. <br /> <br /> I guess there's a kind of Lynchian feeling in the movie, but if a director for the first time really tries to climb such a mountain so early in his career?
