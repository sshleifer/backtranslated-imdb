In the 70s, when I saw this for the first time, I was in high school. It was great then. Now, as an adult, I look back and say to myself ... yes, of course. What was so fun? It has its moments but they are few and far between. It's so outdated that jokes do not stand up anymore. Show this to a younger audience and they will be totally lost. If you like this kind of humor, you'll want to stay with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision, as well as the Groove tube, are too outdated for today's visualization.
