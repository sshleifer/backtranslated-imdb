I used to have a fascination for caricature in college when I was being made. He had a lot of "Get Smart" charm. While it is true that he had his faults, it was quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> Naturally, I was very interested in seeing the movie version. That was before I saw it. Beyond that, I wish it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Besides being an error in everything (who on Earth, although Broderick was even close to the paper?) he just did not get to the grade. <br /> <The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the movie; See a live version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it fun, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy caricature with a very cheerful attitude. It was fun. The film became murky and he took it too seriously. If he had taken a big argument seriously or gone crazy enough to make it look like a "cartoon in a movie," it could have been nice. <br /> <br /> As it exists, it does not deserve to be considered part of the "legacy of gadgets".
