My family and I projected Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old son loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like an Oscar-worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie was if Evel himself had come out of his retirement to slap Samberg for making this movie. However, I must admit that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the movie was set in the '80s, but did most of the music come from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test pattern at your local TV station. Or if you are determined to see this, people under the influence could enjoy it.
