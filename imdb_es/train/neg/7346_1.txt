I feel like I just watched a tobacco movie ... a beautifully acted, tense, absorbing and horrible thing! A litany of two hours of perversion in the most basic and inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse and abuse. There is no redemption. And I entertained. I could not stop looking. What does this say about me, about the people who do and act in these kinds of things, and in a world that has become so desensitized that eventually the real tobacco movies will be the norm? And I am neither a puritan nor without humor, I do not try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I have definitely not led a protected life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​dragging the sewers the same way my own tribe does. It does not have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?
