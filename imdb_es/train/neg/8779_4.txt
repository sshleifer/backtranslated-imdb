As a film fan, White Noise was a big disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, it was well lit, it had a good camera job, a reasonable direction. But as a movie, it was considered as predictable as all the other "so-called" horror movies with which the market has recently flooded. Even though I had a bit of the 'coldness factor', the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem credible. This movie did not explain the reasoning of certain occurrences, but it went ahead with them. The performance was far from hallucinating, the main character did not show any emotion, like many recent suspense / horror movies. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a movie that I'll buy on DVD and I would not recommend anyone to rush to see it. .
