This film, supposedly a thriller, had around five subplots that developed simultaneously until the climax at the end, but ended up more like a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was trivial, the rhythm was slow and disjointed. And the characters were boring. It seems that George Clooney needs to enter a gym, Matt Damon prevented it and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is that it was carefully designed to be politically correct and, therefore, ended without saying anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I have seen documentaries provide more emotion. Look at it only if there is absolutely nothing else to do.
