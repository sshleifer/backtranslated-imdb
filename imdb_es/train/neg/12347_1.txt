This is easily the worst movie of Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this movie is a black mark in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally misinformed in an aggressive film about a girl who goes to the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene that is convincing in any way. It really is not hard to make a movie like this one. Everything the crew does could have been an idea of ​​just about anyone. The writers did not have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogues that made no sense at all; And some action without a brain. I strongly recommend that you stay away from this garbage. I hope that the many talented people involved in this project will realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and intelligent films than this useless disaster.
