Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film to be particularly challenging. Maybe because I am from a different era and from a different country, but at the beginning I found Crosby's continuous references to the Good State of the USA agreeable. UU Do not get me wrong, I'm not anti-American at all, but it seemed that the English could not do anything right and / or needed this brave, oh, intelligent American visitor to show them the way. It is a story of "fish out of water", but unlike most movies of this type, this time it is the "fish" who has the advantage. To be fair to myself and to the movie, I have seen it a few times over a few years and I have the same impression every time. <br /> <br /> (Last night I saw another Crosby movie: The Waltz Emperor - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me and, to my surprise, even my wife, who is worth it, is American, she discovered that American Crosby's "in her face" attitude was annoying: too much reference to Teddy Roosevelt, as she said it.) <br /> <br /> As for the premise of the film, it's unique enough to his time and the cast is, of course, very good. The stage and the music are also good, as are the great costumes, although I agree with an earlier critic that William Bendix's wig looks horrible (Moe's picture of the Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> In general For me, this would be a much more pleasant image without the attitude of Bing Crosby, but as it is in almost all shots, it is quite difficult to sit in this movie.
