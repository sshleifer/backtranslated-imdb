They did this as a kind of fantasy. Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance boy, and just for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe can play with high-class talents, the boring wives of rich and older men. Okay, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still leave room for artistic creativity to produce a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, nor the Arthurian legends, nor Beowulf, nor someone whose life is so wrapped up in the fog of many past centuries that any recreation of his life and times is 99% conjectures It's only a couple of lives ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's foolish for me to imaginatively imagine that this movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel, "The True Story of Kelly's Gang," I had eagerly anticipated that this would be similar. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger mocked a lot that Kelly was probably much closer to reality and, in general, a better movie, which does not say much for that. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's only cost me Two dollars to rent the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's just because some of the good pictures of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
