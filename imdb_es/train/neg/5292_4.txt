I can not recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life on a property in south-east London is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dante's hell circles, frankly. In the center of this is Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of character before, but never so well. The movie starts with him asking for drinks in a pub-pub, that's all, and you already feel trapped by the feeling of frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the movie. It is a master class in functions. <br /> <br /> Of course, the frustrated and needy need a foil in a drama like this and Kinstan Burke equals Winstone as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles makes a capable turn as the son of drug addict Billy, although sometimes he has wondered exactly what he has gotten himself into. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, maximizing the claustrophobia of the flat misery of his council. 4/10
