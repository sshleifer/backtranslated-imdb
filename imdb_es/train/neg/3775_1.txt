['As other viewers have mentioned, this movie was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic in bold. I think the director was carried away by his &quot;artistic vision&quot; about the aspect of the film, instead of a great need for attention to the content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are mediocre and the story almost incoherent. Probably, Madonna was chosen solely as a trick to get the pre-release press. Something good for his appearance here gave some credibility to his album &quot;I&#39;m Breathless&quot; (music inspired by the movie Dick Tracy), which was a stratospheric success (due in large part to the inclusion of the dance hit &quot;Vogue&quot;, It is not, nor does it have the least relationship with this movie). I guess most of the money in this movie came from links to Madonna&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m Breathless&quot; album. <br /><br /> If you look at it at home, for the final titles, you will think that &quot;there are two hours of my life that I would like to recover&quot;. Save yourself the lost time, do not bother with this.']
