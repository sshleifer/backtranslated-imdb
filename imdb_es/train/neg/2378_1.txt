Why did any legitimate actor who read the script participate in this shit? My God, it's really embarrassing to even see him. I can not imagine the shame these people must feel for being part of it. Also, there is apparently some controversy over whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was not accredited, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. By the way ... Rain is your sister for those who have asked before. This movie is proof that it does not matter how many big "names" you have. The sow's ears do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but this was sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone can explain to me one day the reason for this type of film. It does not have attractive, entertaining, even comical properties compared to everything else.
