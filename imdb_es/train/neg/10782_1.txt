the only scenes that made me laugh where those who have Christopher walk in it (the director of the movie) the rest of the movie was just boring. In the first hour or so it really happens. The jokes that are supposed to be funny are not. Jones Douglas is acting too much. julia roberts does a routine job of the old ugly duck (yes, of course!) in the girl next door (where did I see this before?) who takes the boy. To abreviate. I really did not care. What would happen to the main characters? If Cusack really fell off the building in a suicide attempt, the movie could have been more interesting to watch.
