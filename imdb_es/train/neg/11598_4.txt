When you look back on another bad sequel to Nightmare like Freddy's Revenge, at least you have to give it a little credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, such as a child who becomes part of a comic and faces "Super Freddy", but even scenes like that are not used to their maximum potential and the parties without Freddy are simply bored. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of scariness to the series. Freddy seems to be the comic relief now ... but to what? <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
