The previous comment made me write this. He says that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this opinion can be made by a racist. Look, race is nothing. I am blind to color. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what? I could add that I am not 100% Serbian, that I have some Austrian and Croatian blood inside me, but what is the point? Am I dark, mestizo? Is it like that? Anyone who uses racial prejudice with such bad intentions as Lantos (producer and director is racist for me.) Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Everything in hell, but that will not return our dead relatives.I am proud to be Serbian and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family). The film does not show the sufferings of Serbs or Croats inside Sarayevo, terrible terror of street gangs, Muslim extremism, I add: I kneel and pray for all the innocent Muslim sisters or brothers, Catholics or Orthodox, killed in this war. our misery, false humanitarianism, which does not help at all, help Lantos fill his pockets with more enthusiasm, good!
