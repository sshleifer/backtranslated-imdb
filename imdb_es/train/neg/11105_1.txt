It did not make sense and it was so horrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movie like that ... you do not have to see it. cutter or eating people, what should I say ... it made me sick! Oh my God! The film is about people we do not know, but who feed on humans! they have teeth blah blah blah ... is not that familiar? I can bet you saw it in another movie. The cast was so good, but I think the stage was really horrible. and I must say that Bradley Cooper was totally amazing ... he's so talented ... actually I said horrible, but I think due to the horrible scenes ... let me explain it. Did you ever eat a tongue? But in the movie one person did it! It was really horrible ... anyway, I think the movie would be so good without those horrible scenes of human dining ...
