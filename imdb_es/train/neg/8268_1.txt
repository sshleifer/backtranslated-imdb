This movie is horrible. Everything in it has been done before. There is nothing original. I can not stop when the writers do not present their own plots. <br /> <br /> A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called Big. What is even more annoying is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She does not act like she's 13 years old, she just acts like she's stupid. <br /> <br /> From then on, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it happens that a friend who was 13 years old works with her. Wow, how awesome! But no ... her friend is bad and she turns to her, trying to get her job. But, of course, she wins at the end when she comes up with a "great" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie that I have seen a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
