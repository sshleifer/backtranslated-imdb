One of the other commentators mentioned that they almost left. If I had not been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would have left. It's also a shame, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted scripts I've seen. It starts nowhere and does not go anywhere (I'd say it's not going anywhere fast, but it's really not going anywhere slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are signs that something interesting may happen, or that there is potentially something deep beneath one of the characters, but that is all we get: suggestions. There is not a single reward or revelation in the whole movie. It's not that I need an elegant argument to entertain myself ... I love a good study of meandering characters as much as the next indie aficionado. But these characters add up to nothing. Throughout the duration of the film, he does not care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost start to expect them to die, because at least one death could be more interesting than observing their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you would think it would be convincing, but it is not. Instead of extravagant, noir-esquire characters who act harshly, you simply recognize him immediately for what he is: a group of talented but evil actors, meditating and raising their eyebrows while reading a strange dialogue without a hint of the relevant context. All this for two laborious hours, painfully slow. Horrible.
