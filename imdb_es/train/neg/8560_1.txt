When we live when someone likes Joe Swan, whatever it is, he considers himself a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where is the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent? We need them badly, and to hell with Mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is not about anything, just like the characters in the movie do not represent anything. It is this horrible, called Gen Y, which is full of bored idiots, some of whom claim to be filmmakers without having to bother learning anything about the craft before filming. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films like these show how stupid young people, the so-called "filmmakers" can be when they think they're going out without a script, without direction, without thought, without legitimate "camera work" (everything was filmed horribly in DV), without editing , with nothing, means filming "rebel" or "advanced". No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure cinema masturbation (and there's really a "take it out of control", so be prepared). <br /> <br /> Watch the first films of any "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... none did anything as tedious and aimless as This, however, Swan, whatever it is, still goes to SXSW every year and is hailed as a new and brave kind of talent. It's rubbish! I can not imagine anyone who likes this, and everything else that this so-called filmmaker has done (everything I've seen) is just as bad (the newer things clearly made to appeal to a more general audience, one of the comedies of situation). Avoid problems, unless it is a friend or relative of those involved ... on second thought, if you are a relative or friend, you will probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromised situations .... <br /> <br /> Total garbage. This is not art. This is the opposite of this.
