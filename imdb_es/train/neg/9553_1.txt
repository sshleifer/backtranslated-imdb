It is not surprising that this has been released directly to DVD here in Australia, without redeeming features. The dialogue was hokey, the acting, horrible and the script stunk! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up on John Badham's much-superior movie, Wargames of the 80s, must have been in something because it was a bad idea! Amanda Walsh was good at that as an eye appeal / love of love, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main leader, that's all. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames movie. Both are better than this piece of garbage!
