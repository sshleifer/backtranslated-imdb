Fulci experiments with science fiction and fails. Usually, in his films that are not horror, we still have a great score, but not here. It adds very funny scenes, like when the prisoners are forced to hold a bar for 12 minutes and, if they fall, they are electecuted. the guy falls and has some kind of adjustment on the ground for about two minutes, until his friends, who were struggling to hold on, lift him off the ground. The city is an obvious but not a bad model. and the final explosion is, at best, ridiculous. And do not make me start with the terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
