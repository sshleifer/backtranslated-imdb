First of all, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie. The best criticism for this type of cinema can be silence. Film directed to the housewives and grandmothers. This movie tries to look "genuine" and the characters must be supposed to be "real people". An Italian could never think that the characters could be "real": they are simply "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very wrong view of what life is like in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (plot? What plot?) And humor does not make anyone laugh over 12 years.
