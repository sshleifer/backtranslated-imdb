['Please, even if you are in the worst of moods, refrain from watching this movie. <br /><br /> I do not think anything went well with this movie. On the recommendation of a friend, I saw this and literally put myself at 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life in the closet. Poor performance, stupid direction, weak plot and pathetic action sequences, and when combined, you get the &quot;Double Impact&quot;. Even less than the expectations were not met. <br /><br /> I guess I learned one thing: never look at Van Damme&#39;s action movies. They are pure waste of time!']
