In his way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, entitled Hallam Foe, I do not see him addressing his main character as "sir"), is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell, as Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, as Sophia Myles, as Kate, his perverse partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. The problem arises when you try to connect your roles with anything that happens in real life. A young man who spies the intimate details of people's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten. And a woman in Kate's situation would feel rejected and scared, she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> However, these things are not what happens in the movie. The mother of poor Hallam has died and her father married a woman with whom she had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. She has sex with him. Kate is a kind of employed person who places Hallam in a dishwashing job and plays sex games. She looks like her biological mother. Everything ends happily with Hallam "solving" his "problems". <br /> <br /> A few years ago, the play and the brilliant acting film, Who's Fraid of Virginia Woolf, had an equally optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after being destroyed. The problem is that it does not always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the ending is plausible due to the intensity of the emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation never really happens.
