The special effects of this film are, especially for their time, ridiculous and used in such an emphasized way that you can not deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The performance redefines the term "terrible overacting". at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff simply redefine "bad". <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charm in this The film can be found in two things: First is the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as the mysterious Psychic Gaunt, who can feel where and when people will die and is always there. <br /> <br /> The second one is original findings, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, although terrible, but other findings are more original, like the gunman Zack Stone that is capable of feeling the pain of people at that shoots (although his performance falls short here). > <br /> In general ... do not watch this movie, except if you love that old hunk-o-brutal Carel Struycken, as any self-respecting Dutchman should.
