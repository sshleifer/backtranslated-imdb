Roman Polanski has done many, many films that are exceptional. His fame baffles me. Nothing stands out as a high point, except in Chinatown (I have not seen 'Knife in the water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he has made to the cinema concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is simply shameful, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's Baby must have meant the end of the establishment by the time he arrived outside. It is a fairly high concept and produced by lux for a 1968 horror film (never show the baby). But this is just a sap of ill-conceived terror. Everything is artistic to the point that the line of the plot becomes irremediably clear very soon (Um, thanks for the title that destroys the end), and on a clear day you can see that the turn ends for days. He did not keep my interest. It seems to me that whatever this film was, it is totally derailed by the 1960 version of what femininity was. Farrow is a distracted and defenseless woman / housewife, so chronic. Her frailty is oversold ... she is extremely irritating. There are no real ideas in him ... nothing to consider, except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is hardly exploited for its mysterious potential.
