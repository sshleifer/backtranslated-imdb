So this was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" huh? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and a terrible performance? What a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repetitive role (shoot, survive, lie, hit, survive, shoot, lie and infinity.) Is it called a script? As for the British, ashamed to see pathetic Timothy Dalton (Or was he just taking the p ***, it depends on how much he got paid, I guess?) Southern Sheriff's attempt). As for that other Brit, the whitened blonde, what the fuck! There is a tendency towards the glorification of these super-violent "English-speaking" thugs (sic), perhaps thanks to the fact that Madonna's two films manage to entertain and justify violence through the skillful use of irony and humor, as does Pulp Fiction. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre. Definitely one to fail.
