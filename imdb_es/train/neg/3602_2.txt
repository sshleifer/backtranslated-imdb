I am an avid fan of the horror movie B-Rate and I have seen my fair share of photos of Slasher, so I have a substantial indicator to judge this movie. It easily ranks on the top echelon of the worst horror films of the 1980s. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody as Re-Animator and lacks the camp value of There Nothing Out There. . That said, this movie has no value. Keep in mind that the illustrations in the film are for a completely different movie. The fixed shots on the back of the DVD case are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen it before.) A murderer kills the nubile students and the occasional member of the facility by cutting throats and all other tired methods of murder that horror movies use). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: None <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes, who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this movie was filmed, which accepts a job as a teacher in a university People start to die and Forbes believes that the killer is attacking her Is it her new heart with a checkered past or The student crazed by the libido To be honest, it is impossible to worry because the script does not complete any characters outside of Forbes). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Terrible at all levels.) This slasher has the feeling of a school production - high school is because college students could make a better movie than this one.Forms shows a minimum of talent like Seminara as one of the students, but all the others are of the "extra" caliber of the performance).
