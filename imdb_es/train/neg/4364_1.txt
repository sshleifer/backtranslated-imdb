I find it hard to understand why this piece of garbage was repacked. The only saving grace in all this is Ariauna's body in her sexy uniform. Your humor should also be appreciated. She is a definite advantage, but unfortunately it would take a magician to save this garbage. However, it must be positively recognized for its heroic effort and true professionalism. I can not say the same for your co-star Lilith with her plaintive voice that prays in your nervous system. He appeared disinterested and gave the impression that only his presence on the set was all that was needed. Everything said apart from the performance of Ariauna is, in fact, an absolute rubbish.
