I do not know what that other guy was thinking. The fact that this film has been made independently is no less terrible. You can be as believing as you want ... most of this movie is pointless nonsense. I feel like I've been insulted having to watch the first 40 minutes. And that alone was not a small feat. Not only is the performance terrible, but the plot is not even close to developing. There are innumerable holes in history, to the point where you can hardly call it history. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I have written here and its purpose is only to save all the viewers from there an hour and a half of their life. I can not remember the last time I could not even finish watching a movie. This really takes the cake.
