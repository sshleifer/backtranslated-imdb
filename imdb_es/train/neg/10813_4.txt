The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen all versions of Jane Eyre). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. Then, it was as if someone said "Oh, oh, this is running for too long" and cut the rest of the story to pieces. The main scenes, when included, are overlooked, combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the story. There was so little transition or even development of the scene that it would be difficult for someone who is not familiar with the story, even to follow it. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened many hopes and then the end ruined it.
