Well ... then I have seen many really strange / unusual movies in my day. The fear and hatred in Las Vegas come to mind when I think about it. Well, no longer ... from now on, every time someone asks me: "hey, what is the most unusual movie you've seen?" Slipstream is what I am going to say! And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, it was obvious that it was going to be one of those movies with "trippy camera effects". With that I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewind and fast forward the words and scenes of people, play with color on the screen, flash forward and flash back constantly ... then you have the real action. People turn violent at random, they shoot things / people, they say the strangest things that just do not make much sense, if they make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> The film is about a writer who begins to mix real life with the book that he is. Writing and for lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see that this "journey" continues throughout the film. The point is that Johnny Depp made a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining and not painful. Honestly, it cost me a lot even to finish Slipstream. My brain hurt a little. <br /> <br /> I can see some fans of the film say that this film has certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique, but also increases the sensation of dementia ... blah, blah, blah. The point is that this movie hurts your brain when you look at it ... it makes very little sense, it requires all your concentration to even try remotely and understand what is happening and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that you it's over ... and you can say you really sat down! So to finish, if you want to see a movie that makes you say "what the hell" over and over again, both loudly and in your head, go ahead, waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this. <Br /> <br /> Mr. Hopkins, while I applaud him as an actor and praise him for his decision to direct ... please do not re-make a movie like this. Next time, try something that is based a little more on a great narrative than the camera techniques that tend to leave the spectator in a headache.
