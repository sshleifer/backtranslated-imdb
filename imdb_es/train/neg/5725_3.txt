2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" movie from Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; A not so decent hostel scam. Live Feed follows practically the same formula as the previous Eli Roth movie, except that this time the dumb children are in Asia instead of in central Europe. The plot focuses on these foolish children, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they are in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all up in a theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I had heard some less favorable things about this movie before seeing it, I still hoped it could be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge movie 'Torched', but this movie falls simply because most of it is ridiculous or boring. Obviously, the film is trying to go back to the good old days of the Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did successfully), but it does not really come out. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work on special effects, not even the gore is impressive ... although it's much better than acting! There's not much more to say about this movie ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
