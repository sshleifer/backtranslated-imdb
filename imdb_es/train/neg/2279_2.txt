Wow, what a mess this mess was. But it only lasts an hour and I only paid a dollar for it, so I'll live ... unlike the entire cast of this drunk from 1933 that is already all in dust. <br /> <br /> Anyway, anyway, a small town begins to have bodies that have been drained of all their blood. The local yokels start talking about vampires, of course, and a little louder after each body is found. The sheriff of the city or the police officer or whatever it is, played by the incredible actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise. When you mention the fact that the dead have a big hole on each side of their necks, instead of two very close holes, the locals simply say that it is a giant vampire bat. The police officer insists that vampires do not exist and must be a human culprit doing the murders. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not seem to be too upset in any way. He spends most of his time trying to get into the trousers of his sweetness, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the simpleton of the city, played by Dwight Frye, who seems to have played the same role in all the films he made. Also, it frightens the people of the town catching bats and drinking their own blood. Lionel Atwill plays the city doctor who is apparently trying to help the agent solve the crimes. He always sucks as an actor. Attill is the closest thing to a cardboard in this role I could get. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing ... many important names to be a pile of guano. <br /> Aside from the terrible bad name that this film has, the alternative name, "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is also boring and laborious and just plain silly. <br /> <br /> For me, the high point of the film is to see Frye, he gets angry in the strange town, but apart from him, this movie did not offer much. And then, when you discover the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect that all this blood required, I will really be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made many horrible pictures, but at least it was fun and interesting to watch. Think of this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi, and you'll get an idea of ​​how miserable this disaster was. <br /> <br /> If you can not make a good 1930 horror movie, at least put that to Lugosi.
