Honestly, I consider this film as another poor effort of the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a little funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men do) the film falls. Going bored and nothing funny. They leave many things without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little one either. I went to the cinema expecting to see a good job but I left very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
