The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it seem much more interesting than it really is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is, by far, the worst horror movie I've seen, a title that previously had "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From its opening scene, I could see that it was going to be very bad, but I was so bored that I could not care less. This movie contains a ridiculous performance, especially by the boy who has been tormented in his dreams, incredible as in plot twists not credible, and some of the most horrible music I've heard, and I'm living in a period in which Britney Spears and people like this. Nsync dominates the air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. A movie would be so boring and boring, therefore, it would NOT be terrifying, as this would try to animate things a little with some funny phrases here and there, but no. We have the egocentric friend of Tormented Guy trying to be funny, but instead we found it annoying. (Spoiler) And please, tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and hates himself to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night? None! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is anything less.
