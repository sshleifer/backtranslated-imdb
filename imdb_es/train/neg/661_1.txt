Good. So I just came back. Before starting my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I expected to be surprised and come out as if I liked the movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every imaginable horror clich√© is in this. And it's not just the fact that they make everything become a jump scare (getting into a baseball bat that's left on the floor? Are you kidding?). It just was not scary. One thing surprised me: there was more blood than I thought there would be ... which does not say much. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Donna that Lisa's mom leaves her. home. She goes ... goes upstairs. The camera tells his dead father on the couch. Spooky. She goes up the stairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. He finds his brother in his bed, apparently dead (how could he know? He did not have a blood stain on him). The murderer enters, Donna hides under the bed, the mother dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Murderer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to therapy session. This confused many people, they all asked if her family really died or if she imagined it, and she mentions how nightmares began to return. A fill dialog occurs. <br /> <br /> They cut to the chase quite fast. Few scenes in the living room go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago, but the police / family was not informed until he is already there). More stuffing is produced. <br /> <br /> I will not continue with what happens in the movie, because I do not want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who is dying, Horror_Fan has already published a publication about it. But about the subjects of the deaths: they were not so exciting. The people in the theater actually laughed out loud (an experience I had never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the kid boy on the bus that gives the most hilarious "scared" face I've ever seen in my life. The only death that involved blood was that of Lisa, and that was quite scarce. His throat is cut, the blood (if you can call it that, it was practically black) splashes the curtain. The only other blood was in Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he drowned her to death. UM is fine? The movie was one of the most cliche I've ever seen. Let's see here .. mandatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could say they were fighting). Mandatory backup on the killer. Check. There is also the reversing scene in the lamp, but all of you have seen it. Oh, you say you want a scare to fly away from the birds? Well, you have it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of the ones that are here). And, of course, the "we have security-in-all-exits-but-still-escaped" scene. I keep going? Might. <br /> <br /> For anyone who says the characters were not stupid, are you kidding? "Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going up the stairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most defective and stupid characters of all time. The only sympathetic character, Lisa, made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. "Oh, I just realized that the psycho-teacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run away to warn her Oh, shoot, is the elevator slow? I guess I'm going up the stairs and run away at the construction site! "Ugh By the end of the movie, everyone deserved to die. The only death for which someone felt remorse was for Donna's boyfriend (I can not even remember his name, is that so bad?), And at that moment, the audience had completely drained of this film without cliche and without fear . <br /> <br /> There were SOME positives - the performance was decent for the most part, and it was well shot. But that's it. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 1/5, and that is being generous. Just for the laughter (and believe me, the audience had some) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were booing after the movie ended and the buzzing afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.
