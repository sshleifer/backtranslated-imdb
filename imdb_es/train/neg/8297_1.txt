Ugh! Where to start ... first, Campbell Scott's endless anguish becomes a real detour after a while (very little) as he internalizes his growing anguish, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters, as presented by the writer and the director, are totally unpleasant, and that is where the key lies. They have not given us anything to worry about if they are adulterers and if they are still in love with each other. When Scott says to his wife in a low voice: "I could kill you" before his three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfish bad times vanished, I almost wished I had done it, and then done the same with the conceited one. Appearance of Denis Leary before being removed from the Looney compartment. A total loss of time and perhaps, just maybe, resources.
