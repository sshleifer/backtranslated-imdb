As a child, the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was full of great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so, I saw this movie for the first time. I think this movie was like most of the sequels and it did not exceed its original. I think I feel that way possibly because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful girl, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas' sister), so they build a large wall around their house that is in the sea. When Melody grows, she begins to wonder outside the walls where it is forbidden to go. The problems arise when Morgan tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything away from the movie, so you have to see it to discover it. I liked that the voices are the same and again wonderful. I think this is a good family movie, although in general!
