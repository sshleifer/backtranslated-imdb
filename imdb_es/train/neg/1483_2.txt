I just gave this ridiculously titled horror comedy a movie of 2 because it featured several famous porn stars from the past. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, face an innate cannibal mutant, and the plot is more or less well taken from THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN. The only problem is that, unless he has counted wrong, there is only one mutant on display, and he is not that impressive. Something like the panzuda mummy in that homemade movie about five years ago. Some bloody but silly deaths help, but the film is a strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The end is predictable and has been done to death. There is no wordplay.
