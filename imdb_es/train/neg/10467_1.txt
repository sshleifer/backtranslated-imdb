If there was ever a call to make a bad movie that reflected how stupid humanity could be, it would win the prize. The plot focuses on the biblical prophecies found in the hidden messages of the Scriptures that incite a group of thugs in search of power to attempt total control of the world. How stupid does this writer believe that people really are? <br /> <br /> The performance was bad at best. Casper Van Dien squandered his talent making this movie. Michael York's work was very suitable for the role, since he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was disgusting and very disturbing. No tender or immature mind should see this movie. This is how a basic plot of good versus evil can deviate. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness floating around in the movie circles, looking for ways to market this type of garbage. There must be something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still horrible.
