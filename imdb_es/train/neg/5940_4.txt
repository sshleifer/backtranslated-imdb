Look, I'm reading and reading these comments and there's a lot of that I want to say, but I'll try to make it brief but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, let's forget all the how bad this movie was made. .. How he showed nothing of Notorious and I agree with most people who say it was "Hollywood". I mean, what did you expect from a real story? When people wake up and see that they will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is covered and buried in the background. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm not against 2pac or Biggie I love you both, but 2pac and Lil Kim were embarrassed in this movie for sure ... <br /> <br /> Next, for All of you who say that the movie is amazing and that you can not see the truth are also too blind, see it because you think you know something about BIG or you do not know anything about it and you love these films for Hollywood teenagers. Use your mind and look through the clouds ... There's a lot of what you can say when it comes to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because it's a very broad topic, but for the movie I Only I can say it could have been a bit, I mean, much better done. But anyway, I'm just a person who gives his opinion ... I do not have resentments ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip hop and I live for it, but after seeing this movie, every A person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is supposed to live. With all respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who make their living like this, you must go to the other page because it is ruining the young ... Take the wrong message to the children and it is: do not go to school but living from the streets, hurrying and simply grabbing the paper ... <br /> <br /> Real hip hop is supposed to be about love and intelligence, be smart and everything. <br /> <br /> OK I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something and I'm not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years, I still do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I've read or read. how much I support you and listen to your music ... Like most of you. Only the people who were really close to them and the murderers know the truth behind all this. <br /> <br /> And in the end, I just want to tell all the fans and relatives of Biggie and Tupac, these two men were and will be the best of all time, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE, IN THE FUTURE, TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE OTHERS, THINK GOOD YET FOR WHAT YOU DO NOT LIKE, BECAUSE IN THE END .. NOT ABOUT ANY MONEY OR FAME OR YOU COULD RECEIVE AND HOW YOU COULD GET TO THE TOP, ACCOMPANY AT HIS MAXIMUM AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND YOUR MIND ... BECAUSE IF THERE IS A WAY YOU DO IT, YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH! PEACE AND LOVE TO ALL! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT, JAM MAESTRO JAY AND THE OTHERS THAT MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
