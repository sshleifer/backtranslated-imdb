Oh, the bait. I hate you? Let me count the forms. 1. You try to be funny, but you're corny and nasty; Every joke is predictable and expected, and when it arrives, it does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to launch. 2. You try to be dramatic, but you're amazing; the woman behaves in excess, and the "bad boy" looks like Bill Gates, and is as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun - it does not work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a weapon.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, I just see him try to offer a Dramatic and sincere dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want to throw. 3. Try to be full of action, but instead they are bored and crawl too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, the scenes wobble more than those of the Blair Witch Project, and I feel nauseous and, once again, I want to throw myself. 4. You try to be a good movie, but failures, failures, failures. I would prefer to walk barefoot in the Sahara with a package full of dry meat without water, without sunscreen, and only with Meryl Streep as company. This hell would be more charming than one more minute of time watching everyone in Bait through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad boy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that explodes in a car that the character of Jamie Foxx he just kicked out CLIFF, but somehow he manages to escape ... just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch such a bad movie, ever again.
