Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and for any other person who has free time and money to spend (and yes, that was the price I paid, I got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was destined to be a thriller. All I got was seeing Kirkland's misinterpretation of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy forest area. If you want to laugh a good Friday of rain with some friends, I recommend this movie. But if you want to see something at least half decent, then do not bother. <br /> <br /> For my part, I enjoy fucking movies, the worse, the better in most cases. But Wow ... I mean WOW! The only person in the whole movie who did not stink was the little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
