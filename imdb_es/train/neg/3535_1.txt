Good. Who was? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you stumbling over the pipes of ecstasy? There were many of you. Did you do it for a challenge? Is this some kind of cult? Or did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times with different names? <br /> <br /> Before saying anything else, I will say this. Just because you do not understand a movie does not mean it's not great. Maybe he had a bad day at work, or sat down to watch a movie after having a fight with his wife and then he was not in the mood. Perhaps there is a more fundamental obstacle, as he simply does not have the mental capacity or a sufficiently developed philosophical sense to commit himself to it. BUT. And this is a very, very big one but. The XXL mega size of elephant, but to end all the buts. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse incoherence with complexity, and please do not confuse this two-hour non-squirter with an interesting movie. Really. You may think that you are very intelligent. You can even think of yourself as a romantic figure: an independent thinker who defends a masterpiece against a chorus of detractors like sheep. Please do not do it You're embarrassing yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of time for everyone. If you thought about it for a few minutes, you would also recognize it. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of food suppliers and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can not get them back, you know) of anyone unfortunate enough to sit through this ineffable, miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No, wait", comes a voice in the dark. "You just do not understand it, it's NOT LINEAR, that means the story does not go on a STRAIGHT LINE, this is actually the COMPLEX and SUTIL work of an AUTEUR, it addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions, and anyway, they programmed CLUB FIGHT when it came out. Did not they hear it? Because they could not deal with COMPLEXITY Now they eat a humble cake I bet you hate Lynch movies too, do not you? <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a big fan of Lynch, I like Memento, so a story told in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear, and although I only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me a lot, I do not dislike Revolver for these reasons. because it's about heavy, big-brain issues, but he treats them so insultingly superficially as to be ridiculous, I'm not a great chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be that of a pr ecoz of four years. I do not like it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "AHA!" Cries Richie's apologist. "Guy is artfully tilting his hat to Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that I can not write a decent script for toffee. <br /> <br /> Compare Revolver with Fight Club is really very instructive. Fight Club has a nihilistic dialogue with acid language that makes you laugh. Revolver has an obsolete fortune that rejects the phrases that make the ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reevaluate everything that has happened. Revolver has, from what I can say, several incomprehensible turns that do not offer satisfaction because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the carpet out from under people, they will eventually kick you out of your house. And then they close all the doors and windows. And they never let you back. Never. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical implies repeating a mantra of small fashionable phrases. Most are spoken, but often appear on the screen with attributions. It is almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can marry so well with all the clichés of tired gangsters in the world. Ultimately, it is so inconsequential. It does not matter anything. You do not understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> Actually, I liked it a little: the tense killer who has a crisis of confidence. He's fine. But I can not recommend that you watch the movie just to see it. He's only in this for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please, believe me. It is awful.
