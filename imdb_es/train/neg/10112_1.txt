Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many abominations of low budget DVD fans, that no one in their right mind would want to see. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation, will I remember forever as one of the most irretrievably laughable horror movies I've seen? In fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of seeing it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems a kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work outside a warehouse? Did voodoo priestesses really recommend that 'zombies' eat hamburgers with cheese? It is safe? It is safe? It is safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you wanted to see a "good" movie, and I would not recommend it as "so bad, it's good". However, if you entertain yourself with the prospect of probably seeing the most abysmal and helpless movie you've ever seen. This is for you. Now, when someone asks me what is the worst movie I've seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Really? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that really stuns you with his ineptitude. It really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital era, and for my part, I can not wait to see if it makes another film as ridiculous as this one.
