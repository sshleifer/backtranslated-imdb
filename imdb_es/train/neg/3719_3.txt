Imagine removing the mask of a lethal killer and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening was promising, but soon it leaves aside all the pretensions of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason why they made this story becomes very clear: filling a gap in their female market by creating another repetition of "misunderstood, cranky malefactor" (Andrei) encounters "innocent, capricious beauty" (paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting time creating an original premise, the filmmakers went directly to look for money: the bad boy was domesticated by this capricious beauty, and from there follows a series of insincere and strongly cliché love scenes dotted with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fuzz. being (eponymous) a "poet" takes advantage to round out the perceived qualities that a Byronic hero should have, but even when we are told loudly and underlined how to write who and what it is, it is still difficult to believe Rlo - or care. <br /> <br /> For a byron hero / antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation, all of which is completely absent here. This is not a modern Phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather stupid woman (with loose elastic panties) goes out with a bad man who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as the rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances could have saved this movie, if they had been good: the female protagonist is worried about looking sexy and "from another world", no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged while he gets rid of his part. This is not your best job. The flashes of interest were presented by Jürgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better movie would have fired the sister and stayed with the brother.
