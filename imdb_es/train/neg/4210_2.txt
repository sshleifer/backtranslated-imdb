Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like to ride a bicycle or climb the tree house because he knows what kind of accidents could happen to him. Then, one day he is riding his bicycle and, as it is beginning to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. There the whole story unfolds. He experiences all kinds of personnel and in the end he is not afraid anymore. But the whole story is amazing and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make the story better than it is.
