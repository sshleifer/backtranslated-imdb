I can see the guys doing budget preparation for this movie. "Well, let's see now, we spent 50% on getting to Dirk Benidict, because Battle Star Galactic and Team A were great, 40% spent in a demon costume, no matter what the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script, and we spent the rest making the movie. " This was pretty bad and VERY clich√© ... Have a loved one present when you see (or bring a good book)
