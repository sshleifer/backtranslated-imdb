Yes, I saw the rough cuts. The scenes of sex without editing. The scenes of calamitous cut. Almost on par with the movie "The Need" for a horrible performance. This movie is as bad as the bad ones. The bad script, the bad performance, the bad effects, the bad locations, the bad acrobatics, all bad. The best 'actors' in the movie were the lap dancers that they hired for the extra vampires! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the 'foppish actor' as someone else said, makes the match look talented here. His incredible ability to drive a car badly, when he is obviously being shaken by people on the hood (see the reflection in the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is class. Oh and do not forget about the sex scene. in addition to his remarkable use of a toy gun that the types of props could not even bother to disguise as a real gun. The other actors on the screen could barely deliver their lines. It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were so good that the ones who did removed their real names from the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, then rent this movie ... again, there are many good comedies that are just as fun and funny. Do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
