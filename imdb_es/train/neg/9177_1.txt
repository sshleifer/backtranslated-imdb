The House of the Dead was the worst movie I've seen in my life, between the pathetic camera angle attempts of the 'matrix' 360 and the corny performance that I fell asleep. I do not think the director and the set manager can decide if it's raining or not, because there will be rain on one side of the boat and not on the other. I would rate this movie as 1 out of 10, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also, jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lost time. I beg to anyone who reads this, DO NOT SEE IT. It's not worth the time.
