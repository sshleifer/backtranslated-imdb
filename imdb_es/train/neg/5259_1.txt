After I finished watching this movie, I became so angry that I lost 2 hours of my life. That is 2 hours I will never go back. Ugh When you start this, you can think "Wow, this is really good!" But rest assured that first impressions do not mean ANYTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I've ever seen. This movie is just pathetic. The performance is insipid, the storyline is anything but original and there is nothing especially special about this, except that it is the WORST MOVIE OF ALL. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! WARNING!! MUDO movie you will never regret IF Waste 2 hours of your life in this !!! 1/10
