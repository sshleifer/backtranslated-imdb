I'm a big fan of westerns, but this ... how bad I stink! I think what turned me off almost immediately was the inane dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Considering this terrible dialogue, none of them looked ridiculous. Actually, I'm not kidding. Some of this is little better than what you would get in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. It was probably THE "big" star in this movie that if you call it B-Western, you'd be lavishing praise on it. This is what should be called B-less western, maybe. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other important talents. To appear in a vehicle, this poor thing must have been something that tried to play down the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One annoying thing about this movie is that all the men seem not to have shaved. A week and their faces are all greasy. I know that in the old West, the boys were not always well prepared, but for a man, this is a movie that makes you just want "EWWWW!" Really, this is an unpleasant Western. Denver Pyle also had to live this way, especially after the appearances in so many great Westerns. Bad, bad movie.
