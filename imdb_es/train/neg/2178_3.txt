I would have enjoyed this movie a little more if it had not been for Jason (Herb) Evers insisting on the experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurais accused Toshiro Mifune of exaggerating. However, as more and more critics saw that movie, they saw that it was done on purpose. Jason Evers obviously is not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is exactly that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B were quite good actors, less Evers and the dancers. If you saw this movie, you would have noticed that Evers was screaming on almost every line, that is, until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coldly. <br /> <br /> The special effects were even for the course in a B movie like this one. In retrospect, there is not much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
