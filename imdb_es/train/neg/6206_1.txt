Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong guys. That's the problem with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and quite heavy and it wanders through the crazed end of the drug as if, like its director, it has nowhere to go better. They introduce us to the main character of the title, which is a bit strange, we see it in school and in the house without fitting in, feeling uncomfortable in itself as so many teenagers do. Robert falls in love with bad guys and starts missing school and drug use, and before he knows it, he's a rapist psychopath. <br /> <br /> The film is really about Clay's total inability to understand the links between images of violence and violent acts. . Clay seems to think that a generation of crazed youths are made evil by the scenes of war on our televisions. however, he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this kind of truth? <br /> <br /> If Clay has not seen YouTube, maybe he's naive and does not know what will be done with the scene of the brutal climax of his movie. All anyone wants to see is the most horrible scene at the end of the movie and I'm sure that will be what stays with the people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is useless because by committing such an act of violence to film Clay, it not only condemns young people who are actively involved in the prevention of war, but also condemns himself same as the author of extreme and insipid violence. for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Shame for everyone involved.
