I regret every second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I always find it difficult to turn off a movie once I started watching it. Especially when it's a classic or what people call a classic. I think this is one of those movies that all movie lovers should have seen at least once, so that's why I saw it. Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, no spy movie or a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of these two genres. The only thing that caused tension was that it was not clear if 'Bogey' and Bacall would remain together at the end or in part from each other. I think "Having and not having" is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the forties.
