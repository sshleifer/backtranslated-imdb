Holy Sh * t this was a horrible god. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought I was going to get my eyes out a lot in the Oedipus Rex mansion. Dear God. This film deserves no more credit than anything made by a movie buff in high school. Please save your money, this movie can not offer you anything. Unless you enjoy the shows and sleep in movie theaters. You know, bring your girlfriend and do interesting things. You will be the only ones there anyway. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> They warn you. <br /> <br /> I recommend not seeing this. <br /> <br /> hi. <br /> <br /> How is it? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> Enjoying this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> this comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to see this daym movie. this is sad.
