['WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you care, in addition, excuse the covers). <br /><br /> Beginning with a dramatically unnecessary voice that is so much more annoyed at saying nonsense, it continues with a meaningless and unnecessary drama. That is wrong but it is set with precision. <br /><br /> We know that space travel is a risky enterprise. There is a complicated system with great potential for dysfunctions, radiation, symptoms related to stress, etc., and unexpected things are likely to occur in largely unknown environments. They knew that things could go wrong. In fact, things had gone wrong. It&#39;s called learning. Granted, the Appollo 11 was not secure by today&#39;s standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology in the mission was impressive. <br /><br /> Errors / varied comments that I did not even have to look for: <br /><br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh That&#39;s what I would have done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all. <br /><br /> 2) NASA gives green light in spite of the fact that the Appollo 11 will probably explode. (However, this is &quot;only&quot; implicit). Yes, that&#39;s why they let people and the press see almost in real time. <br /><br /> 3) The ejection of the capsule would not work. As if it did not work when a chimpanzee was inside. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video of him, probably you can find it on YouTube or at least look for it somewhere. <br /><br /> 4) A man interviewed says that an explosion would have destroyed a fair part of Florida. I can only assume that it was understood as a hyperbole, because if not, I&#39;m just horrified at how he could do it so badly. <br /><br /> 5) The technology was primitive compared to current standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware are used even today, because they should not fail. It is even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be composed of comparatively large components that are not so susceptible to radiation. (And the ship itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like B2 would not work). What about the fact that they were using &quot;TV screens&quot; instead of &quot;computer screens&quot;? It&#39;s the same damn technology. Actually, television monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition. <br /><br /> 6) &quot;If that object was not part of the rocket, it could be just one thing.&quot; We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the claim is wrong, who says it was not part of a rocket? At least one interviewee clarifies that if a thing is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /><br /> 7) The voice-over and some erroneous quotes make it appear that the radiation sheet of the lander was actually his helmet. What would make it thinner than a space suit. <br /><br /> 8) The close death of Neil Armstrong during a practice flight is an image that I can appreciate; I had not seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it has not been sufficiently tested because, as you know, it is unprecedented. <br /><br /> 9) The discrepancy in the trajectory of the landing module descending (due to irregularities in the density of the Moon) at no time was potentially fatal. Nor were the &quot;fifteen seconds of fuel left&quot;, which were, in fact, &quot;fifteen seconds of fuel before having to abort the mission and return to the command module&quot;. <br /><br /> 10) A &quot;chain of catastrophic events&quot; generally results in a catastrophe. I really do not know how to make it simpler. This, however, is an excellent example of the rhetoric used. <br /><br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and jumping aimlessly like a happy child, followed by a voice-over that tells us that the reason for this strange behavior &quot;can now be revealed&quot;. It turns out that he was walking and jumping aimlessly like a cheerful child. Hilarious things <br /><br /> 12) It is mentioned that during the re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and was as well known at the time as impossible to avoid with contemporary technology. Once again, the seriousness of this is implied, but very intentionally. <br /><br /> 13) There was never a shuttle lost in space, while the voiceover presents this &quot;fact&quot; as evidence that Apollo 11 was a pile of trash. Apollo 13 was almost a loss, but the two real disasters occurred during takeoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing the ferries with Saturn&#39;s rockets is somehow ... well, it&#39;s fine, just stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful ferry missions seem not to have been considered of interest to the audience. <br /><br /> 14) What the hell is wrong with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it does not make sense. Unless you assume it was created for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with little understanding of history, science or rhetoric). <br /><br /> Even the point of the movie is something dark. Phrases like &quot;concealed until now&quot;, &quot;publicly revealed here for the first time&quot;, appear, but the film is not at fault or offers a lesson or something, that could be expected from a film so emotionally made. . In the old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interviews and fragments of recordings that are often out of context or with people we know nothing about, except the &quot;NASA scientist&quot;. Wow, then the astronauts were very nervous before the effort? Luxury that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yes, what a point. <br /><br /> In short, in addition to being intentional or incompetently inaccurate, it is not even good entertainment. And believe me, I&#39;m a guy who enjoys his shitty documentaries; This movie is not funny, witty, picturesque, it&#39;s nothing.']
