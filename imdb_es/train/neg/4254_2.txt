I can not believe that the same guy directed this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well-written, if he acted wrong. <br /> <br /> This stack can not even affirm that. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignores the narrative that later describes what happened next. Following the narrative correctly could have made this a good sequel in some way, but Craven chose to go to the style of his older films, since he did not have a good tie but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor who plays Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
