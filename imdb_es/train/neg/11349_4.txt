Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first animated 3D movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Did not Bug's life do that, too? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I say before they go and use that as a logo. In addition, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it a movie, since it appeared in a "theater" and could be purchased for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flies were. I liked the IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a great job making a movie with something that is just a round trip adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
