This is not a good movie. The performance is remarkably rigid and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know if it is a real horror approach or to go for the camp and the kitsch route. I never saw the first movie, but it does not stand on its own merits, there are several unconventional plot twists and the viewer never realizes the importance of the female vampire leader. It is not worth the effort to see.
