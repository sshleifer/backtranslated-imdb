Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get worse, I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not take it. In addition, they made many mistakes about how the proper archaeological excavations are carried out. For example, you do not handle the artifacts until they are recorded and counted. The biggest crime in the casting was the girl archaeologist. She is a weak actress and I felt that her performance made the film less realistic than it already was. The whole concept that the Knights Templar were underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and those things, so they almost seemed depressing. I thought that the characters were not sufficiently explained. You did not find much background and that made it more difficult to relate to them.
