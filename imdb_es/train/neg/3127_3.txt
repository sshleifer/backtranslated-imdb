An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles upon an ancient 40-foot mummy, well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and call a Jewish translator to help him discover his story. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in "those days". In order to save his son from a devastating flood that was predicted to kill him, he mummified his son, burying him with several servants for centuries, planning to wake him up for years. In our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the movie is slow, and it has to do with a lot of biblical garbage and a couple of terrible, sharp fights. The mummy is decent but not shown enough. It should have had more to do with that, but it was dragging a lot, so ... eh. Do not bother yourself
