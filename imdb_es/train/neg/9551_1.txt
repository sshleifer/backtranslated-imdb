This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "movie" was filmed "War Games - The Dead Code" 2) See the original WAR GAMES with my current Knowledge computer and the eyes of a preadolescent of 1983. 3) Break into the pentagon's computer in the 80s with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER in NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE minutes before your first day of filming. 5) Return to the present, have a beer and ask Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "show" my blank memory. event, especially my original visualization of "The Dead Code" 6) Take another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad version of a good 80's movie. <br /> <br /> 8) Forgot He has killed Jar Jar. I'm not sure if I would have to travel in the future for that. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
