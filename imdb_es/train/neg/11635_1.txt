Well, this is a short, sweet review ... Something the movie should have practiced and made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There's a good reason why there was a petition with more than 40,000 signatures. ALL of Uwe Boll's demanding ones stopped making franchise movies that people liked. Blood Rayne is very important there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times. The acting is descendant, but in reality you can only blame the script for that. Even a few moments I wonder if they are using a script. <br /> <br /> The movie has nothing to do with the original games. HELLO, if you've played the games, you know that the main character has no real motivation out of the homicidal impulses like mass murder because he hit his toe or simulated. There is too much history for such a stupid movie. as I said. I would not even steal this movie. And for the person who says that this is the 'funniest movie of 2007' .......... you have to take a look, the news is better than this.
