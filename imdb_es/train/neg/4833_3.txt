Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some brilliant Avatar Oscars just because the politicians wanted another war hero movie to increase acceptance (support?) For the wars the United States continues to fight today. I do not really want to get into politics here, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. The damaged cabinet does not really have anything exceptional, nor a real plot. I really feel in the 50's of Hungary when the party told people what they like and what they do not like. The same propaganda films were produced that time, only with the exception that they were black and white. Even if we consider that this title is a reasonable piece of the genre "the wars of the United States are great", surely you have much better movies to choose from.
