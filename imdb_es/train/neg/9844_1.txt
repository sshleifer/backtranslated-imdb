This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of those movies that uses all the stupids that face the clich√©s they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Actually, Don Johnson was pretty good at that. But otherwise it stunk. I saw it more than 10 years ago, but it still hurts and will not stop persisting in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I will not ruin it for you, if you want to tempt fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a * nghya * moment at the end, with some in between. If you have nothing better to do, and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it's worth it. Also, if you are forced to have an appointment with someone you do not really like, suggest to watch this movie together, and they will probably leave you alone after they see it. That is a fair price to pay, I suppose.
