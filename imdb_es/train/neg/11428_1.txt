OH MY GOD ... THE WORST SH * T I HAVE SEEN - this is the main thought that came to mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Although, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. I refer especially to the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was played in an affected and annoying way. Every time he appears, he reminds him that he is watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment, and then a full movie, because most of the time he can see are his stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create emotion. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
