This movie is another Christian propaganda film in the line of the Omega Code. Not that this is necessarily bad, but because most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to convey. If you enjoy a styrofoam portrait on the street and the way the Gospel can change a life, maybe you can enjoy this movie. I mean, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? It was frustrating to see the criminals represented who are not allowed to swear (eh? The criminals say bad words?) And flat characters with whom I could not really relate. Also, it would have been great if the movie had shown some T & A. Now that would be something that I would like to pay to see. Who was the imbecile who compared this story from a movie The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
