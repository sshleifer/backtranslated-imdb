There was nothing of value in the original movie, it was even slower. The fact that I even found it for rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this movie must be high on something! So, what was the story line? What was wrong with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story in the first four minutes of the movie? Unfortunately, I tried several times to see this. I even borrowed a child from someone to get some comment. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the film director, since possibly some of the shots made the film more than a B movie. That could be pushing it. I loved the musical theme. Luckily it was only worth a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you could enjoy the movie if you were high as the cast and the team would have to be. Is the pot legal in France?
