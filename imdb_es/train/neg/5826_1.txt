The slow and pleasant images were changed to each other, with music sometimes annoying (you know, Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you have not slept enough, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But, in the last 20% of the film, the director decides to bring an idea of ​​rebirth, reincarnation or, through images of S & M: "spiritual lovers" are cutting the bodies of each one with knives. For me it was a very disturbing and really changing general impression of mixing abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director are great, but strange. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy it at all.
