This boy has no idea about cinema. Well, it seems he did some interesting theatrical shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that were more successful for political reasons because they cheated communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR WORK! The scenes are unbalanced, without an appropriate start and with a messy content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he liquefies excessively with violence, nudity and blank language. How is it possible to keep alive a corpse so rotten that it never understood anything about the film profession and art? Why do not they let him succumb to pieces?
