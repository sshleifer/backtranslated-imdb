*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie: the useful interpretation of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the performance is horrible (this is not helped by the atrocious writing). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, the head of an Asian criminal syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing in my head when he was expressing his "fury" for having lost a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line "is a hostile takeover" (which is the rest of the title of this movie) was delivered as badly as one could. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress distinguished himself in this movie. Next we come to the plot. This should tell you everything you need to know: in the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the city center. Now, she is a C.I.A. Agent (or was some other government agency, I'm sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. The application process was like. Interviewer: What past work experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher Interviewer: It's okay; you are hired! I only give him a "2" due to a decent performance and a good plot twist at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be captured).
