I really wanted to like this movie: location shots were filmed mostly in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful pictures. But, even for a filmed caricature, it was a very bad movie. The continuity and rhythm were simply horrible. The best fragments of the film are in the final credits, so (almost) it's worth sticking at the end (although, curiously, it repeats a bit during the last half hour). <br /> <br /> When the best performance in a movie is from Andy Dick, you know there has to be a problem ...
