Mmm, does not a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Other. Other. EAT. Eat it! Continue down the throat until your face turns green with nausea. You just had the experience of Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I came across this show in the winter of '98 and I was hooked instantly. Like that stack of pancakes, I swallowed it. But the enjoyment soon vanished, because the character of Ally McBeal (whom we see as cute and endearing at first glance) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure and whining quenar you've ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer that my females have a spine). The gags and tricks of the program also become trite, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which really is stuck in your face) becomes ironic and the incessant character changes and rewrites make the program become a damn telenovela. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is that you take this program in small doses and leave it as soon as it becomes annoying (and it will). I did it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured. It was good while it lasted, but like a crazy and neurotic ex-girlfriend, she became ugly after having overstepped her welcome. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like the fruit cup. He will sit with you much better.
