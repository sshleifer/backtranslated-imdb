When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-made horror movie, but in reality it was very different, since it represented what I would describe as an initial effort in science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi play with scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively), to some extent competitors, until Rukh wins Benet with a demonstration that demonstrates his great theory. Science here was, to say the least, a bit harsh (therefore, science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction) but somehow Rukh takes advantage of an Andromeda ray that allows him to look at the earth "several billion years ago what." In that prehistoric era, a huge meteorite crashed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that scientists call "Radio X", which can heal and destroy. A large part of the film is set in a rather tedious way in Africa, in search of the meteorite deposits, which Rukh finally finds and exploits to create a great weapon, unfortunately it is infected with some kind of disease that also makes it a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were very good here. Lugosi achieves a role in which he is the good guy quite well, although frankly I found it a bit unconvincing, especially during scenes set in Africa. The story also advanced a bit, and although it caught my attention, it did not captivate me. Since this is really a science fiction movie instead of a horror movie, and that science fiction was in its early stages, I guess the movie needs to be a bit loose. It was fine, nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10
