Having recently reviewed Lipstick recently for the first time in a few decades, I endorsed it with "Descent" even though I've heard more negative comments than good ones from other movie friends with tastes as varied as mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the movie Rape Revenge has evolved over the last 32 years, from the gore of "I Spit On Your Grave" to the sensationalism of "Lipstick", until The good handling of the theme in "The Accused". But "Descent", although it makes some important points, never offers us anything really new in terms of revealing meaning. No, the "Descent" is so poorly done in terms of image and sound quality that it detracts from any meaningful message you might expect: a message that, when examined closely, is not as innovative. <br /> <Br /> I knew the plot quite well. What I wanted to see * was * the "descent" or the degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario's, he was anxious to see how the layers were removed and his psyche was slowly twisting ... you know, the kind of representation that DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver". Unfortunately, the script and director / writer's options do not provide any kind of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The most important point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club jumps, drug use and obsession with the great black stallion Adrian (the nightmare of all white children, natch) of a question and answer session on the DVD, But this excursion to Dawson's character is never credible. We do not know exactly what the hell he's doing half the time, what he's after, or why he's doing it. The poor quality of the audio / video again does not help, but the sequence is too long and useless. It destroys any impulse and investment in the main character established during the first act, otherwise, exceptionally well done. When we reach the final, our interest has already vanished. <br /> <br /> A point of success that Dawson points out in the questions and answers is that at the end of the "revenge" scene we are forced to give back, then realize how exaggerated and ugly reality is. While that is valid, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, check the deleted scene from the "classroom". This is an excellent game of 8 minutes more that sizzles with energy and provocation (although all verbal) and really shows that Dawson's slow creaking is materializing as she lives deliciously to the poor and condescending counselor of Francie Swift's bedroom. If more expository scenes like this had been added and the middle third were reduced more, we could have an interesting psychological study of the impact of acts of violence without meaning. <br /> <br /> As the film is in the final cut However, all we get is what we have seen before, only in a more graphic representation. And that?
