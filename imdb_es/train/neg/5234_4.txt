This is a strange sexual comedy because there is very little comedy but a lot of sex, most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic that it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I'm not kidding, the sex in this movie is so simple that it could strangle you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE and BOB TOO there is not much more worth mentioning, except the language in which each sentence seems to contain the word F. This is a fairly hyper-realistic British film Shady made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films, which explains its low budget feeling for television.
