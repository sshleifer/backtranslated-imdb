I am very happy that I did not spend money to go to the cinema :-). It is nothing more than a compilation of elements of some other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc., framed in a quite boring and pointless scenario. I really can not understand what was the purpose of creating this movie, since it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its history, which also makes no sense. In addition, there is nothing to see: the FX seem to have been taken from a thrift store, usually seen in all other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
