There are many good things about the new BSG: there are several roles of Cylon for models 8 and 6, for example, that the two actresses interpreted excellently. Onboard the Galactica there is the industrial design feel of the old school ("My ship will not be connected to the net, above my body!") In addition, all space battles, special effects (although the experienced observer of science fiction will recognize the caricature of Everything) The darkness of the characters, their essentially defective nature. <br /> <br /> That makes it even more bitter that the end was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, The scenes in space, the foray into the Cylons and all that was very good. But the soft end? I always watch movies and shows these days with the hidden timer, so I never know how much time is left until the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen again and again. Every time I thought, oh, this is the final scene, the final shot, I have one more. All the characters have their full ending! That was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted the hobby of the schoolboys of everything: the young scenes of Roslin. Why is it important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sisters and her father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has an overnight affair with a former student / student? What does that contribute to the story? Where was the link? Now, I am in favor of a more European-style approach, and a random act of anything in movies and shows, and all that, but this was just ridiculous. This did not contribute anything significant to the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have seen the "Frakkin's last special" and in it Ron revealed his own lack of idea about the plot: he could not find it. a good ending to the story, so ... he just did not do it! It's never as much about the characters as they did the last episode. The idea of ​​"this was thousands of years ago in the past", Eva's mitochondrial thing, was also used in the Galaxy Hitchhiker's Guide, and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know that particular history of H2G2. And speaking of Hera, now there is a story that DID NOT WORK well, EVERYTHING. Instead, we have that Roslin is doing his former student, who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I am for older women with younger men. More power for them. But this ... it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In general, (the writing on) this series is as flawed as they pretended to be their characters. That goes even beyond the last episode. I hope that Lost and 24 will do better, with their final series.
