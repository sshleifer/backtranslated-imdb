What this film does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that provokes more emotion in the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with the disconnected narration, the frustrating plot holes and the contradictory scenes, this film caused me frustration and is not "the best monster movie". <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good: comedy, acting and special effects. From the first moment, this movie starts quickly and blatantly. The initial scene, the origin of the monster, is campy and fast, and pays homage to the classic "environmental" disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pace is fast, which was a welcome break from the long, often pointless, dramatic scene of other monster movies and allows the movie to jump right into the action. Over the course of 10 minutes, you get the 'why', 'where' and 'how' of the beast and you are ready for action. In this, the movie offers. <br /> <br /> After another short and well-recorded sequence, the characters are presented: the lazy son and his precocious girl, his kind grandfather and his talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are presented in context with each other and their conflicts are apparent instantly, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly appears to wreak havoc on the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster itself looks great: strange but familiar, something like a dog and a fish pooped by a squid. The effects of the creature are insurmountable and, although it seems strange, it is credible and in no time of the movie you could "see that they are ropes". Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited Rottweiler in linoleum, monsters traverse the crowd, sliding on surfaces, crushing and eating those in their path. When the path of the monster crosses the family and a tragedy occurs, it is really a painful moment, and you may feel the need for revenge, but from then on the attractiveness of the film begins to unravel. <br /> <br /> Following the start of dynamite The film quickly loses focus and continuity. The lines of the plot are introduced, then abandoned, the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and the comedy intertwines in dramatic scenes with a confused intention, while the obstacles appear and disappear apparently randomly. <br /> <br /> As for the comedy, let me say this: I am willing to accept that much of the humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things got lost in translation. However, as a student of Asian higher education in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years (still here) I would like to think that I have a better knowledge of Asian humor than the average white man. That said, there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be fun, but, to me, they were not. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack in which the daughter is lost, the family He is at the funeral; Everyone is in mourning. A new character is introduced, a brother, and the tension increases even more as it becomes evident that the two brothers are facing each other. Both begin to mourn their loss and end up competing with each other for who is suffering the most. This competition is, in essence, fun: two brothers who are so upset that they even compete in a funeral: it shows the thorny nature of common family love in Asian comedy. This subtle slap-stick comedy taunting family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny, but it seemed really out of place in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER *************** <br /> <br /> <br /> Then come the holes of the plot . There are so many points mentioned in this film that they are never explained, or, worse, they are explained and are disturbed only by showing themselves impotent and meaningless at the end. Discovering that an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some comment to that nature. Instead, the audience is haunted by anti-climax moments when problems simply "no longer exist" and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to begin. So I ask you: why even mention it in the first place? <br /> <br /> This prevailed throughout the film, since the problems gave rise to new problems and, suddenly, the world of the film is full of opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course, the introduction of new and greater problems is a time-tested storytelling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc entails the forced shortening of another, we would at least expect the new arc to receive a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you received several stories, each one only explained 20% of the way and, in the end, the parties never converge to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Again, I am willing to accept that. A lot of this could be 'cultural'. Maybe it is in the tradition of telling stories in Korea to play comedy in a tragedy. Maybe it's normal for stories to repeat themselves like a child coloring off the lines on each page, but never ending one. Maybe it's okay to present a problem to develop the plot but then eliminate that problem at random without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all the hallmarks of sloppy work and bad unbridled narration in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
