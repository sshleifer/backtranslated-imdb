Personally I would advise people to stay away from this movie. It is generally a bore to watch and the fight is badly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the release of this movie in Hong Kong Legends on DVD, the only thing worth listening to is Bey Logan's audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, since when does a Ninja movie exist? stalking. I can not think of one and, frankly, I do not want to. <br /> <br /> In general, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: avoid movies that contain the word "Ninja".
