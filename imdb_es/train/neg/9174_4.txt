Usually, I like zombie movies, but this was just bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: the girl swimming topless with the bottom of the thong, the topless Sonya Salomaa and the tits of Ona Grauer trembling in a spin when she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video cuts, too much Matrix slow motion (drag the action), there is not enough blood and guts, bad acting and no story. The only other person in the theater was smart and went right after the topless swimming scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
