The next time you're at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression 'author's will.' Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them they feel through 'Head over the water'. The only way Diaz could have survived this film was through this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some funny scenes and you will have some laughs. However, the film does not resist the smallest logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why she can make the chainsaw gag of course. For me, the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars on the video store.
