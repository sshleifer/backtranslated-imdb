Then, when Herbie made his first appearance, he was perfectly happy to see Dean Jones assault. I just wanted to entertain myself a few hours and eat popcorn with butter. Now, unfortunately, I have the expectation of a fascinating / fascinating story every time I watch a movie, if I'm not taking some kind of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no big laughs, no complex frames, no difficult turns. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for those who are fully charged. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw La Lohan on the screen since she moved with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent at that), and I can not say that this time I was terribly impressed . Aside from his constantly changing hair color that distracts attention unnaturally, it just did not sound like the guy next door who had spent his whole life circling around the road runners. His "need for speed" was not consistently represented in the film, maybe it was elsewhere, it seemed older than his part, and it seemed he was always looking for something (a party, a designer, a new place to spend money?) Off set. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; That romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay was engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was too exaggerated as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the Introduction to the movie with footage from the old movies. If Disney had come out with some Car 53 jewelry, I could have used some just to be loyal. Your new feature (?) Was a bit inconsistent (do you channel your driver's thoughts? Now skates?) But whatever. We all knew how it would end, but I wish it had ended with someone a little less foolish than Maggie. And my head still hurts for that lesson that Maggie and we viewers had hit at home. <br /> <br /> What would have made the movie worthwhile? Make old Herbie participate in a real story with a real plot, at least, Herbie is as good as Lassie, but clearly that is asking too much. Why is it that Disney is always the same again as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "The computer that used tennis shoes" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was a great movie for children and people without expectations. For the rest of us ... it's for when you have the flu and can not take the suspense from the back window.
