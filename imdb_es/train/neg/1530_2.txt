I WANTED TO HAVE ENGRAVING BLANK MEN to see it again <br /> <br /> "What? You mean you really enjoyed it Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean I could see it again to see if it was as retarded, stupid and as embarrassingly unpleasant as I can remember <br /> <br /> Many people have said it was made for children. Can I suggest that it was also made by children? because the entire structure of the script lacks any kind of discipline on the part of the producers and writers, and many of the pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at that time. <br /> <br /> The cast did not help, but I really began to feel sorry for them. Honestly, you can believe that during filming, the cast had to lie to their families who were filming a hardcore porn movie, since it was their shame to have to appear in something as depressing as this one. To give you an idea of ​​how bad it is acting every time BAYWATCH, the girl Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative, I waited patiently for her to reappear, seconds later, I forgot I was in the movie. I have it ? A BAYWATCH star appears and, seconds later, he forgets that they are in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the WHITE MEN standard. <br /> <br /> Fair enough, is trying to be a live action caricature similar to THE GOODIES (Although THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie) Although perhaps the film deserves some credit for never having gone down to the humor of the toilet, but considering that it is a movie for children (This did not prevent ITV from broadcasting it at 11 pm), then there should not be any kind of humor .
