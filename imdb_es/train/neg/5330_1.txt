Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, only part of them are right. For me, this is the worst movie ever made in my life. I have never seen anything so rude, insulting, vile and against human nature as this film. A real shame for the film industry, this is not so bad, it's good. You can not have any bad quality fun here like in some of Elvis' other bad movies, like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through his pain. Pure garbage. Native Americans should sue for their poor clich√© and stereotyped treatment here. Actually, maybe ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and the bad service that this film gives to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. Grade: F
