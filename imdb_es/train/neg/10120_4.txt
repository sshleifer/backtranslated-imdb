This Hitchcock movie has little resemblance to his latest suspense films and seems much more like a very old-fashioned morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while, the emotion begins to diminish and the couple dissipates and has no meaning in their existence. However, out of nowhere, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything, and in the end they are much happier because they now appreciate life! What a strange, silly and preached movie! Personally, I would like to inherit all that money and discover if it makes me miserable. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are relatively low compared to the subsequent productions: an approximate film with a poor and quite amateur sound quality. interim.
