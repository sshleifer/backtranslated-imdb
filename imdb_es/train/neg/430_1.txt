Wow. This really is not so good. <br /> <br /> I would like to agree with the others that at least the acting is good ... it is, but it is nothing special. <br /> <br /> The film is so prearranged and for my part, I am fed up with receiving cultural information through films. <br /> <br /> * / ****
