I really can not understand how anyone could give this disgusting movie more than 1 star ... How can you like a movie so delayed, where all the scenes of animal abuse are real? I do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain that these innocent and helpless living beings felt in those horrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them in that way for no reason, or just for money? ? I tell you that the director has mental retardation or is a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both He really deserves to have his hands cut off and burned alive. <br /> <br /> It contains several horribly barbarous scenes that can cause commotion, especially to sensitive people and children: a real frog has live skin, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown into the water, a dog is beaten, birds they are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than horrible; It has to be the worst and most delayed film ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I will never see or buy any movie directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time looking at it, especially when there are a lot of TRUE fantastic movies, in which all the scenes of animal abuse are organized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only some people liked this, which is natural, since it is the worst movie in history, so it was not successful. I hope this causes the retarded director to realize that such unwarranted barbarous acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will never be praised, and that he will present all the scenes of animal abuse in his next films. I really believe that everyone receives but what they give! There will be a day when all the cruel and delayed '' humans '' will feel the same pain they once inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> This, however, is probably my only '' negative '' review. Normally I do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I could not shut up. I had to tell the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
