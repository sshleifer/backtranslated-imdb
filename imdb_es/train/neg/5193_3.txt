Another turgid action / adventure movie from the Quinn Martin Productions factory.

As the guys and several critics have pointed out, the movie "Fargo" had more Hawaiian locations than this movie.

Zulu, who will later star in Kono in Hawaii-Five-O, appears as the evil and inept partner of Thinnes, while France Nguyen models that Jenny Craig's diet went terribly wrong. Others who share the blinking screen include a drunken impersonator of Richard Harris, an imitator of George Takai, a not-so-wise hitman with sprayed Sansabelt pants, and the villain "Tree," sporting a British plush accent. You can decipher the plot to half the opening credits, but relax, just enjoy the vertiginous mediocrity of the 70's week movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I think about this movie (and I think about this film often), I find myself humming the song, written for flute and tuba ... nobody knows why. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, one of the three contract directors of Universal who would then make much bigger films, in his case Jaws 2.
