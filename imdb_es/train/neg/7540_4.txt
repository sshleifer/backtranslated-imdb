The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I really can not say I'm sorry to have seen it. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the film, like the terrible performance and the long scenes in which Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a sequence of dreams, with a hallucination, etc. ., but it's just not worth stopping when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you MUST see The Wicker Man, even if it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that he has some genuinely spooky ideas, the only problem is his corny execution, unintentionally funny If nothing else, this is a movie that can inspire you to watch the original movie of 1973, or even read the story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a corny horror / thriller, it's really aesthetic. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed in one place instead of using a green screen or elaborate sets, so we can see a very good scenario. There are also many very well composed shots. It's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of him or not, it seems impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There's always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness that he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I always love to see him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is big or terrible, he always puts his unique energy at stake, and it's never boring to watch. It is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a hell of an article about this movie, since it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist film ever made. "Watch?" You could write, "This is what happens when women are allowed to run a society!" In addition, the similarities between this society "Summersisle" and a colony of bees are quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, you've probably seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, which includes Cage running in a suit of bear, and of course, the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still quite funny while we see them in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD used in Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you find out, it's about a dollar for a reason. It's a good offer. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unrated version of the movie is the best one to watch, and it is better to see the theatrical version only because of its small aggregate in the epilogue, which includes a cameo by James Franco
