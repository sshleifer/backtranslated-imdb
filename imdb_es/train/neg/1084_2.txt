I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman may be unpredictable. In this case, it was a great fault. Altman's attempt to create suspense fell on his keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again", I did not think he could contribute to that turkey, and I hope it does not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen in the way of most of the winners of an Oscar. In a downward spiral that includes acting in money movies to eat like this. Duvall was a great actor in excellent films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
