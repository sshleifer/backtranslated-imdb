Chillers begins in a cold, dark, stormy night when a bus leaves three passengers outside the bus station, a boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor, Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discover that they have lost their connecting bus and are stranded for the night. In the waiting room are two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who currently has a frightening nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay Encounters and friends, a guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay sees Billy, he dives into the pool and then disappears into the air before it comes to the surface. Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident five years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and tells others about her nightmare, everyone else responds by saying they have also I suffered disturbing dreams recently. & decides to share them to pass the time ... <br /> <br /> The following is Mason who tells a story of how he and his two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are terrified during a camping trip ... <br /> <br /> Then, Sharon, whose story revolves around a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal), whom he calls by phone, before long Tom is at the door from his house but he actually turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> It's Ronnie's turn below and he describes how he discovers he can bring life back to the dead, unfortunately he brings in the mass murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) back to homicidal life ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conrow tells a story of how two of his students brought an ancient Aztec war god named Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then go back to the bus station for one last turn (predictable) ... <b r /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I've seen in my life and I generally like this subgenre. Boyd's script lacks what it takes to make movies like Chillers work, you can see the final turnaround coming and every story is really boring. The first is totally useless and does not seem to have an end, and the best of these anthologies are the short stories that are finished with an impeccable turn. The second story is predictable and, again, it simply ends without any reward. So, it continues throughout Chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfactory to see and has no reward for doing so. The dialogue and the characters are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own and, in general, the film totally sucks. At least each story does not last long and I liked the idea behind the linked segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd was obviously working with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is that if you want to see a short story of 15 odd minutes in its entirety inside a pool, Chillers is for you. Stories are not smart, scary or have some kind of tension or accumulate for anything. Having said that, it has some nice scenes and some surprising competition shines through the occasion. Violence and wise gore there are not many things that happen in Chillers, a ripped heart, a decapitated head and a bitten hand is as bloody as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically, Chillers are poor things that do not. impress anyone Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and production values ​​below average. Chillers also presents one of the worst songs of closing themes in history. The performance is also of a very low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there was a lot of effort put into Chillers as a low budget movie and at least the filmmakers tried it, so I'll give credit for that, at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking that it's bullshit. Similar anthology films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) & Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990) ) They are much superior to Chillers, so look at one of those.
