Sergio Leone turns on his grave ... If there was a movie that tramples on the work of a man's life, it's this one. The bravado of the "lone wolf" of the main character is boring and unconvincing, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight-degree education. Whoever this idea was, he should be whipped with a horse. The only reason I spend time destroying it is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. The family of Sergio Leone must sue, not because it is garbage, but because it is now immortalized as garbage by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does a shit that will not offend anyone, except cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
