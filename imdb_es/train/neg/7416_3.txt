A fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool, banging her head against something floating on the surface. With pretty kitschy effects (this was a television movie) she floats out of her body. She floats through a swirling tunnel of orange smoke rings, and rigid black figures lean toward her view (they look like the mannequins in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie ... While her friends revive her, a black arm grabs her by the wrist and she has to fight to free herself. When they revive her, she remembers everything and has a bruise on her forearm. <br /> <br /> Soon after, she is almost run over by a runaway car that climbs on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico on vacation. When he arrives there, he is surprised to discover that it is the Day of the Dead. They are upset by another American tourist who follows them, and almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have had near-death experiences. Everyone has experienced the tunnel, but not the black figures or the repeated escapes of death. One of them has done it, and is very anxious. She is also encouraged to meet with a psychic. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells you about the people he calls "Caminantes" (the name of the novel on which it was based). They are people who supposedly died for a cause that, when examined, prove to have died from another cause. Therefore, it is as if they kept walking after dying until they died again, but he blames the bad records. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the 102 minute video, and it seemed very long. I can not imagine there being a 192 minute version! Maybe if it was meant to be seen for two or more nights on television, it would be better to see it that way than in a session. <br /> <br /> I've only read a novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if so. It is representative of his work, not the most original of the writers. Floater had the common plot of: that of a child kills people in revenge. Even the variation was quite common: the child who kills and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave. And, in fact, it has a point in common with this film, since the child practices astral projection, and when it drowns, it floats out of his body like here. I do not know how close to Dead of Night his novel Walkers follows. I understand that Howling's films do not look much like his novels. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly slow movie, and the special effects and cinematography are really limited by the (presumably) low budget and made for -the shortcomings of television. There are many actors of easily recognizable characters in him. It also feels very dated, earlier in the mid-1980s than in 1989. I found it boring. Sole Survivor (1983) is a much better low-budget film that covers a similar theme that I do not think has dated so badly (it could be said that it is the inspiration for the Final Destination films of the 2000s). It goes from the dead of the night.
