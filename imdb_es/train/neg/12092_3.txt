I can not help but recognize the cinematographic abilities above Haneke's average. For example, I appreciate its persistence in environments with little natural light as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, with regard to the content of this film, I am very sorry to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to pathologize relationships or feelings of domination-submission (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with his mother is incredibly topical, as is the alienation and incomprehension that Walter feels (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way, which is understandable; look as if she were crazy, or as if she were a monk, come on!). I mean that D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is foolish to treat the subject as if it were something "strange" or pathological; it is not. In general, the films that deal with this topic are really lagging behind. <br /> <br /> So, for me, I think this film ends up being a programmatic film, concerned with very old-fashioned psychoanalytic theories (it's not like that). Is it almost shameful?), And that does not really relate to the lives and experiences of the people involved in the D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, IRC chat rooms, even recent academic studies will prove it).
