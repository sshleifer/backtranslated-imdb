Kalifornia is disturbing. I think there's no reason for this story to be told. It is neither entertaining nor has social value. Technically, the film is very well made, the performances are first class and first class. The story unfolds in an intriguing way that keeps the interest. But in the end this film is sick and is abominable to decency. I do not recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
