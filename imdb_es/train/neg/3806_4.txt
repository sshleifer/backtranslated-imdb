My wife and I thought that this movie was a diluted version made for the television (BBC) of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which in itself is good, but not excellent. The story has little interpersonal or chemical tension, and not much plot. The character of Woody Allen simply wanders running through his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much else to do. It is quite disappointing, I must say. The role of Ian McShane is just an appearance of an extended cameo. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was: "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to expel him from Manhatttan". He should have needed the money, and they should have needed his appeal to expand his audience beyond the youth market attracted by the two stars. I give this film 4 stars instead of 3 because it is an unbearable background noise. If you ever want to be put on something while weaving or sorting your stamp collection, this will do the job. I would not pay to rent it again.
