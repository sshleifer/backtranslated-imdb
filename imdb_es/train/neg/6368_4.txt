This is the last time I rent a video without registering in the reviews of IMDB. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote, wrote the really horrible Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed the trash as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a shame he got involved in such a bad movie. There is a frequent confusing edition that seems like it was a last minute decision to make up for the lack or the story, the shooting and the simple common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What were you thinking?
