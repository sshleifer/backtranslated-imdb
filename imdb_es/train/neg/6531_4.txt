First of all, I would like to say that the user's comments only left me with tears in my eyes for laughing. A comment that the bad films of SF become good comedies is right. MST3000 has made you live from that. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the dream of a 10-year-old comic book rush of 1959, you'll have control of this fool. All the elements are there: the pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often hilariously childish. The attitude of the adolescent boy towards sex, with the captain "gigolo" (good call, boys!) Making the eyes of the "scientist" with red hair is a wonder that does not activate the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so strange that everything lights up red, but an alien monster has a mouse face, and the extraterrestrial alien has an eye that spins like a child's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who seems to have never finished eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. And, of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. If these people had met E.T., they would have roasted it in two seconds! "OW" in fact! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I qualified this low movie. However, it is never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything, just to make everything sound more ridiculous), and you must admit that, in your small child's core, it makes you jump several times. <br /> <br /> Well, then do not admit it. I guess you never had 10.
