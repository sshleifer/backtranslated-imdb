I picked up this DVD at the dollar store. The DVD was in the 2 rack for $ 1, but since I had Michael Madsen, I thought that, since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I must say that I did not. I like the movie. The movie was played more like a documentary or a religion ad than anything else. I discovered that the use of director flashbacks was not added to the story line for me. I would have preferred to see the story line in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it away as one of the other commentators, but it may be a long time before I consider seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen's film debut, it might have some file value at a future date.
