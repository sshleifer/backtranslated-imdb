I'm at a clear disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I've seen many Larry Cohen movies. The fans of the series seem to think that this is a good movie. Judging it by itself, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You can never see well the face of the maniac police (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was quite grim. The scenes of death seem ready to eat the most movies, not to give emotions. Maybe if I saw the Director's Cut of NC-17, I would be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end of the chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. The best part of the movie.
