The words "Swedish" and "action movie" do not mix. That becomes increasingly obvious with every attempt made in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt their family if they do not do what they say. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its ups and downs. And generally in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", only "downs". So I guess something in this movie showed some quality. To start with the positive comments, I can mention that the film is technically well done. The images of flying planes and helicopters are well filmed and they look very good. The performance is of very varied quality. Shanti Roney has a decent performance, while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long the Swedish directors will continue to use her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden board). Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as the "great" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about the action scenes? Well, as I said earlier, the flying and flying helicopter scenes are nice. But apart from that there is not much action to talk about. And that's a common problem with Swedish action movies. There simply is not enough action in progress. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's a film culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because, frankly, the story and the acting are not good enough for this movie to be based on that alone. <br /> <br /> I qualify this 4/10 for effort.
