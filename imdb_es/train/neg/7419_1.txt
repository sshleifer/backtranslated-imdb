This movie was horrible and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad cast, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual Hollywood tradition, the government of the United States is shown as always evil. The sympathizers and supporters of the communists in Hollywood, most of whom are as stupid as a box of rocks, love to take the crazy madman Eugene McCarthy and see him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a marginal character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, and the United States brought all those evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without which we would not have any space program. He really loved being an American and he became a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> And yet, the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, an uneducated group living a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want. And, nevertheless, this is the same government that they portray continuously as an evil consummate in films like this.
