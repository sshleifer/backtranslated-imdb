Tony Scott directs a thriller about sports that should attract even non-sports fans. And some say that baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too slow. Well, cheer up! Outside, he seems to be a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro), while inside he is a psychotic fanatic of the San Francisco Giants. Along comes a new hitter (Wesley Snipes) and a designated savior of the crisis. Our salesman has a murderous obsession when the hard blow of all the stars falls into the worst depression of his career and it is feared that the Giants will fall apart with him. De Niro is terror personified. Snipes seems very natural as the ball player. Other notables in the cast are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and a very strong language are expected and you get the value of your money.
