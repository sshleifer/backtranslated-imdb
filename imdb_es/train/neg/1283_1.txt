I have to say that the first time I saw this movie was about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and when I saw it for the second time I asked myself why I liked it. The acting was horrible, and as usual we have the typical stereo clan men with their fake disguises. The performance was horrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot was good, but the execution was simply bad. I'm tired of seeing Scotland represented like that in the movies. However, Braveheart was even worse, since these movies only save the grace. But seriously, people did not talk like that in those days, why do all actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another movie to try to capture the essence of stereotypes already tired and annoying. I realize that the only people here who say that this movie is good are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they would like it, I know they have a great attraction for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking about buying the DVD, I would say spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
