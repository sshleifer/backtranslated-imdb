6/10 Acting, not excellent, but good acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, make some stupid decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story has no meaning at all and has a lot of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave him 4 for this movie and it may be too much. The characters are so exaggerated of what they can be in real life and some pretty inexplicable things happen "in the form of history", not in the best way. Due to the style in which this film has been filmed, he gets bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera shake and rapid advances). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story unfold without problems, but there are too many clues in it. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music.
