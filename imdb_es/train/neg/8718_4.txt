The third installment of the trilogy "Carnosaur" presents a group of military commandos of the Keystone Kops quality who try to kill two Velociraptors and one T-Rex. I give him a 4 out of pure sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of the trilogy, it really can not be taken seriously. However, the most important thing is that when watching this movie I can not help but notice some interesting parallels between the trilogies "Carnosaurio" and "Xtro". The first installment in both franchises is a dark and disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "Alien" scam, and the third is an ironic film, almost slapstick (whether intentional or not) that has rolling on the floor laughing. In addition, like the "Xtro" franchise, all the films of "Carnosaur" have no relation to each other. They only carry the name of the franchise to awaken interest in the "sequels," I suppose. Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups working here, but if you've seen the three films of the two franchises, you're referring to the two.
