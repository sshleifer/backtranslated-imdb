Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this project could be done. It is by far the worst Elvis-related film of all time, totally extravagant, silly and with many mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention of Suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try to do the best they can, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an imitator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy who plays young Elvis sucks. minute. If you want to watch an ultra cheap movie, crazy but absolutely fun related to Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
