This movie is a very funny movie. The violence is bad, the acting is ... Well, Dani, stick to singing or screaming or whatever you do. Random girls who use almost nothing is only to catch sexually frustrated goths. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and the characters COULD be very good, if, for example, the direction, the actors and other small things were improved. But the movie is bad, the only reason why people like this shit is because it has Danni in it. This movie is possibly the worst B-rate movie of all time. And believe me it's hard to achieve, especially when it competes with Def by Temptation and shitty excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, so I see this as another junk movie ... A very bad one. If Dani did this as a comedy, then, go. Very well done. More than that, however, I rate it low, because it's horrible. Look at it when you are in a happy, happy, happy, happy way, so you can laugh at everything or if you have many different types of drugs.
