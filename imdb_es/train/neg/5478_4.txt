With nothing better to do, I decided to take a look at "Aztec Rex" (since it was being billed) for hell. <br /> <br /> The silly story could have played better if the effects of the dinosaurs were convincing. In fact, they seemed animated (those crude designs that artists use later to finish the CGI effects, adding more details, softer movements, etc.). Dinosaurs looking absolutely horrible, which is the only reason why they would probably want to go through this. . <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was the charming Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget had been increased and some convincing dinosaurs had been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the movie was filmed.
