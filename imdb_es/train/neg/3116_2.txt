Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> BUT ... If I have to sit down on a movie it is: <br /> <br /> Director </ i> <br /> Director of Photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> You can not join the damn Boom Microphone in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie, how can I enjoy and concentrate on the story, as well as believe in the damn thing when Do they remind me of the technical aspects of making a movie? ¡¡WAIT THE DVD OR NOT BETTER
