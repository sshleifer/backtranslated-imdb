This is a low budget horror / creature film by Roger Corman. A DinoCroc is created when the manipulation of prehistoric genes goes crazy. A crocodile designed first kills one of their own, then gets the taste of the human being and becomes a fast-growing terror after escaping. None of the characters has depth, but it is not the focal point. We only have a few glimpses of the huge offspring of two-legged dinosaurs and some of the best "kill" scenes in a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a silly character trying to use a three. Bait legs dog and it becomes crocodile food. Nothing remains on the dock more than the upper ankles. Without really outstanding papers: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and a detestable professional crocodile hunter, Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed by the seductive Joanna Pacula, since the respected and feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming herself as a pot of pickles.
