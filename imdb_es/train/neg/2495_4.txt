The problem with this type of film is that, literally, dozens of them are made every year. Fortunately for its use, only a handful receives a theatrical premiere, while the others are being sent directly to video or TV, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is really its originality. It's one of those movies that uses the "Die Hard" formula of a tough but troublesome guy who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, he is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security procedures for companies and individuals. In this case, they are sending it to a cruise ship that, of course, is hijacked. You can see this movie as a kind of mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the film does not even try to hide that those two films were probably their biggest source of "inspiration". So, really, you can not consider this movie as an original at all. Use all the clich√©s in the book and this movie really does not offer surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original. <br /> <br /> As you might expect from a movie like this, it has a very weak script. Or rather said, it presents a very lazy writing. As I said before, the film does not present anything original, but also the actual story itself presents some elements that are far from probable and are simply ridiculous indeed. I mean, to hijack a huge cruise ship with only 8 men, of which half only carries some small arms and then ask for a ransom of 'only' 10 million dollars, for a ship worth approximately 10 times that amount is already in itself enough to ridicule. How do you intend to split that money afterwards? Each person receives a little more than a million or something like that? That is not profitable for such a large and risky company. And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage. Somehow, they manage to take all the passengers in the enormous hostage of the ship and manage to put them inside a room, with only one guy with his gun, who does not even seem to be able to hold correctly, watching them. However, you never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all the people who were on board at that time. Also, when Van Dien's character goes looking for his son and vice versa, no matter what room they spend on the huge cruise ship, they always collide with each other instantly. Just some examples of lazy writing inside the movie. <br /> <br /> But, of course, it's an action movie, so the story, of course, becomes secondary. But, again, it is not as if this film presented a good action. Half of the actors seem to have never had a gun before and the movie is full of some slow-motion taunts. It really becomes laughable in the points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not have the best actors either, although I must say that Casper Van Dien really is not a bad 'action hero' and actor, as regards the genre and the circuit of movies. However, he also suffers the same problem as Tom Cruise; No matter how old you are, you just never look convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien once started as a promising young actor, but starring in movies like this really does not help much in his career. He is probably capable of something better, although in reality he is never given the right opportunity to prove it. All the other actors also do a fairly fair job, but their characters are so formulaic that they never become really interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, it's not the worst genre movie I've seen, but it's also like that. Nor is it exactly the most original or memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
