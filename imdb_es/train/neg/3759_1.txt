Oh, where to start? The cinematography was great. When the movie started for the first time due to the initial scenes of the landscape, I thought a good movie was waiting for me. Then came the Bigfoot CGI. It looked like a cartoon of King Leon and the loving son of King Kong. It completely removed the credibility of the character. Now I knew there was not a Bigfoot chasing people walking through the woods for no apparent reason, but a corny CGI caricature. So from then on the whole movie was shot for me. The money they threw down the toilet for the CGI they could spend in a disguise like Roger Patterson's. It was Bigfoot's best costume that no one else could match. I'm a fan of the movie Bigfoot and I was warned about this movie, but my compulsion led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed by the previous warnings. I know that after reading this review, you will still say "I must see the Sasquatch hunters, I must see the Sasquatch hunters". Then you will say why I wasted my good money earned on such a boring movie!
