I have seen some very terrible horror films in my time, and although this is not the worst of all, it is certainly in the lower half. The script starts well. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an inmate, hoping that it will lead to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The movie goes straight to the bathroom when you realize that something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement that is reaping the souls of people. It is the job of 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 security guard in all hospital staff to drag this mental patient to the ground floor, do a ritual that simply involves cutting the tongue and then allowing the haunted house of a demon to Go out and steal your soul through the magic of cheese special effects. At this point, the movie becomes so ridiculously stupid, that I was begging for it to end. There was still an hour to go. It seemed like an episode of "Tales from the Crypt" for half an hour that somehow stretched out in an hour and a half. From Tiny Lister doing his best imitation of John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet, this film fails at all possible levels. I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reasons. 1) Your fianc√© is quite sexy, eased the pain a bit towards the end and 2) The movie really looks good, much better than the current trend of horror movies made with quality Wal-Mart home cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this shit even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As an extra drinking game, you and your friends take a chance every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head as he talks. You will be drunk 15 minutes in the movie.
