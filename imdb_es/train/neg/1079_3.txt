I feel like I'm the only child in the city who was upset by Branagh's performance. He is a good actor by most accounts, but he just could not get the southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a jerk. One of the previous critics questioned why the actors of the United States were not chosen in this film. I second that notion. It's wonderful when the actors want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard for the performance to become tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to hit Branagh because of his absolutely horrible accent too. Everyone deserves to ruin here and there. But it's hard to see something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of trash than sit on The Gingerbread Man.
