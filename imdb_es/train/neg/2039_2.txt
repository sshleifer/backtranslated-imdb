This movie was almost intolerable to sit on. I can go beyond the fact that it seems that it was filmed with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to be extended for weeks, but the characters do not change outfits once, but the performance broke the fourth wall into pieces for me . I have seen better acting in a 4th grade work. Apart from that the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the guy with whom he would have delivered it. I also felt very disappointed that all the murders were committed with a weapon, what kind of blood is that. That is not an imitator that Zodiac did not kill using only a weapon that the authorities would know was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called dissociative identity disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. In general, I think that this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget, at least not as low as they had done, or they could have made sure that they had better actors or more gore. Many people have opted for the low budget route without having to use the horrible actors with Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
