An anthology is always a risky business and I think that this effort should be praised. There is a lot of talent involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I really could not enjoy this movie based on the three problems I had. <br /> <br /> First, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them collide with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped for me. As seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I am not talking about happy endings here (not even of a final period), but they lack even a basic development or even solid configurations that attract it. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its inhabitants were portrayed correctly. <br /> <br /> What you have left are the high-profile short films that may still be of interest to some, but will leave the average viewer dissatisfied.
