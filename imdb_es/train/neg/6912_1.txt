The only reason why I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest loss of time I have endured. For approximately 75 minutes, you are subject to the WORST performance (and I do not say it in a good way, as in KILLER NERD, which had a horrible performance) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also absolutely NOTHING to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of garbage was because it has a massacre in the title. That said, there was only one murder in the whole movie and it was pretty boring. You spend more time observing children fighting and gardening than anything else. Speaking of children, the actor of young children is probably the most irritating child actor since he left the house in the cemetery. Did I mention that it was also filmed on video? If you want to throw away money and more than an hour of your life, then take care of it. But if you taste your money and your hard earned time, then you get away as far as possible.
