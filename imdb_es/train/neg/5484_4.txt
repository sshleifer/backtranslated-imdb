This film is about a family that tries to accept the death of the mother / wife by moving to Genova, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genova" looks promising, but unfortunately it is empty and unattended. The film only consists of a collection of scenes that represent the daily life of the family, such as swimming, taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and boring, and fail to emotionally attract viewers. The ending is very disappointing since it is not spectacular, emotional or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by "Genova". The only good thing about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as an extended tourist advertisement for the city, but not as a movie to enjoy.
