Those 2 points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films do not strive to be realistic, but PLEASE, a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good father does ... he throws his son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow: 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and move from that to live hungry in the garden shed of her in-laws ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a specialist, is bitten by rabid dogs, then leaves. This movie is an INSULT to our intelligence. I really can not believe that I have contributed financially to the "people" who made this film taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please, do not submit to this mess to see it. This takes my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.
