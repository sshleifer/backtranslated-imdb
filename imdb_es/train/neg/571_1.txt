I only rented it because I loved the first movie. However, calling him John Carpenters Vampires: The Dead is just a hoax for you to deal with. In fact, he is an executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> A tragic story, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the Vampire Hunter minus convincing all the time. It is not even comically bad. <br /> <br /> What we ended up with is a boring movie, without involvement, with a terrible script, an indefinitely bad performance and clich√©. It only stinks at low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the bubonic plague.
