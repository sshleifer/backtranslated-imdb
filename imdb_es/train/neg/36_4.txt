This movie seemed too long even at 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there are always too many images of people walking (through the jungle, up to a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to avoid runtime. It is worth watching the movie for the risible and naked native zombie with big swollen and bloody eyes that is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be entertained by the bad English dubbing, the free female flesh and the silly make-up work on the monster and the native extras. For a zombie / cannibal movie, this was pretty light in the blood, but then probably I did not see an uncut version.
