How could I express my feelings about this movie better: horrible? A headache? Lack of coherent writing? flat stupidity? Try all the above for this farce. And that only for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I guess there is a story. Two silly blondes look for work after crashing a plane on a golf course. They are confused with a "murderer for whom the world is renounced" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "mobsters". One thinks that "taking it out" means a date, and the other one receives the minor actor with whom she dreams. And, of course, the turtle reserve for the turtles they build with the casino winnings. <br /> <br /> Does it sound like all this could be fun? Guess again. They try to make it fun, but it's not. The filming sequences are not well done. I have seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. The images are average for a film of the late 80's. But the problem is that it is a 2007 film. <br /> <br /> It is not worth spending time to see this again. It still does not surpass the film "Out" by Danny Glover of the early 80s as the worst movie of all time, but again that film is unique in its class. "F"
