What can possibly be said about this film other than, "spectator, care". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label as cigarettes do, because this was detrimental to my eyes and ears. I'm rarely dissatisfied with a horror movie "b", but this movie could not even scare a five-year-old boy. The point of a relentless lunatic who thirsts for blood in a movie is that he should look almost like a god, as if nothing could stop his maniacal fury, but in this movie the resident psychopath is trapped in a fireplace in a strange attempt to surprise his next victim and, of course, follow the popular legend of Santa Claus, is a reminder to the viewer that this man is not at all dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. In short, a total waste of film.
