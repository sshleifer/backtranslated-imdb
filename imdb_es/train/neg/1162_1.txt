I went to see this movie in our university theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry, Jack Nicholson), it's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on without a discernible point and then it just ended. The lights went on and I watched everyone looking around confused. The projectionist had lost a reel? I have never had the need to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it was not a drama about some of the annoying college basketball players and their coach. The funniest part of the movie was watching the totally confused quotes from the audience. Fortunately, this was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
