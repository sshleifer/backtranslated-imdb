1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can not believe you lost two hours of your life to see the role of the credits. Honestly, I think I could make a better vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that not only stinks (more than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a bit great, has some mystery and kicks his butt a little.
