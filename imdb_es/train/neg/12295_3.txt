This movie presents two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure, the effects are ridiculous, the history confusing, but just seeing Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun. I especially like the old hotel where they used to shoot this, which added to the little amount of suspense that had gathered. Give it a 3.
