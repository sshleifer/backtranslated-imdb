Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their leader, Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And attire and movements. They work for the governor, Kevin, and they were recruited after wishing to be heroes and play in that game. They also lead normal lives, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from the villains who fight at school. All the villains have quite unique and unique traits, like Mister Vague and his men, who never seem to know what their plans are, but they act anyway. From an evil robot to an evil baron, the three have to find them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style seems to be simple on purpose. The backgrounds have superimposed colors and the buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty good, and the show is not too bad overall, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plots are almost always absurd and ridiculous, but after all this is a caricature and One can not blame them for that. However, this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
