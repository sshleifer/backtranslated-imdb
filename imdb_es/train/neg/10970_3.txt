This is absurd, apart from the Australian comrade who has reviewed this film, I can not help but think that all those who have sent a review so far participated in some way in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with their praise. . <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not really a fan of comic-to-movie conversions, so I did not go into high expectations, and even so, I found that Elektra is incredibly disappointing. What bothered me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this movie that was left unexplained, that left you thinking "huh, how relevant is that to the plot?" or "then, how did that aspect of the character emerge?" I can only hope that these are things that may be explained a bit in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to have a face-to-face effect. Random moments to adapt to the story, and I do not even mean the secondary plot absolutely useless. I am also (still) scratching my head about the fate of the character of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who seems to have run out of explanation. <br /> <br /> If I can congratulate this movie for anything, I would have to do it. I know the fantastic places where it was filmed, but otherwise I enjoyed Elektra a little. I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even by the standards of action films) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, heck, at least Jennifer Garner looks great.
