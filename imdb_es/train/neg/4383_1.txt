The worst comedy of Bob Hope (and that includes a great competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha who "steers her boat". Someone undoubtedly directed this piracy of Hope on the cliff, as it has Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can not make you laugh or get excited. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need it?
