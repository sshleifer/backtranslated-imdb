As I was pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a try. Although she is decent in brave and modest roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) leaves much to be desired. His character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually unfit (the secondary plot of Sandra's past appears as an unnecessary filler that does little to develop her already superficial character). The two teenagers gave good results, even though their forensic expertise and their "catch me" attitude are belied by stupid mistakes that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn as the too obvious suspect is wasted here, as is the symbolic character of Ben Chaplin / love interest. <br /> <br /> *** Ahead Spoilers *** Mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced back to a TV plot of the week that has never convinced you of the motives of the murder in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid mistakes (vomit a rare meal at the scene of the murder, very convenient and framed) Of the school janitor, the two boys together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc., they make the vision go from being intrigue to boring and disappointed by the murderers. The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience with how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes do not surprise anyone and lack the so-called intelligence that the film intended to reach your conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost all aspects. * outside ****.
