I went to this movie believing I had good grades. First of all, it's ridiculous to premiere a film originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie seems outdated. Even for 2001, the film seems to have been made with a budget of shoelaces. There is a scene in which a taxi hits a man to work out the low budget he can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the movie had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it while I was sleeping in my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. She wears ill-fitting clothes and frowns at random children. As for Alec Baldwin, a scene in which he meets Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins put it correctly: "Go home and write better!"
