The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and it looks more like cartoons than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo since the series premiered in 1969. I did not like Scooby Doo's animated films (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full movies), but some of them were pretty cool, and I like most people considered that Scrappy Doo is an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation, and listened to the characters, (and I use that term lightly) talking, I cringed. In addition, Mystery Inc. was a team, and without the full crew to congratulate, it seems like opening a box of chocolates to find someone who has already eaten the best, and the only thing that remains are those that nobody wants. . The new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you are going to have a Scooby Doo television series, include the elements that made the series last so long. All the cast of characters, and quality animation. They need to put this back under the rock where it came from.
