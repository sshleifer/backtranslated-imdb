Well, I can and I will be very short. This is a wrong and unconvincing movie that could have been a little better. The script does not seem to know which way to go ... from funny to clich√© seriously ... it's a bit silly. That and too many phrases that we have heard before "the hacker is in Florida, or not, he is in Madrid, he is not in ... he is screwing the signal". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
