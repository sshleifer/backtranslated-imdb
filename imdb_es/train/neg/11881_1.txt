This movie has nothing to do with "Office Space" except on the premise. The office space was very funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, since I did not laugh even once during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgent slides become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or see it in someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.
