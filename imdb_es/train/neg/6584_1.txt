Being the only film I could see at this year's "Nordische Filmtage" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as a historical minimum for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a piece of sick shit! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have rescued the film. E.g. The plot: after the first 15 minutes, it became clear that John was sick, the neighboring girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting until blood flows to me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately they were not the only disgusting images that were shown. Everything else was copied by other directors such as Lynch, but, of course, without his genius. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize the whole movie and save other viewers time and money: the boy loses his girlfriend, the girlfriend goes home, the boy kills the girlfriend and then gets angry. The boy imagines hot, but the neighbors crazy, the boy has very nasty sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes that he is crazy and that his girlfriend and his new lover remain in their apartment time. . Bad story, bad actors, photos, that make you want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how well you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - At least one benefit of the night - and you can not choose 0 points here.
