How can they do it from Joe Don Baker (like Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (like Bufford Pusser in the second sequel)? Because they did that? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser, they should still not change it because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that's one of the things I wanted to see in the second sequel. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 and I would have given it 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with the life of Bufford Pusser, but it was and that's why I gave it to this movie a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I suggest that anyone who is planning to see this cheese suggest that they do not and see the first sequel instead.
