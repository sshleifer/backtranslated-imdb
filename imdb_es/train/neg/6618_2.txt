GENERAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, the long-awaited AAG reaches the screens. Unfortunately, he could not establish a progressive fire in the audience. The best thing to talk about is the idea of ​​remaking the powerful SHOLAY. And Varma made the decision to change the total fund of the film. If he repeated the same backdrop of Ramghad, people will say again that there is nothing new in this. Different backgrounds are appreciative, but the way he presented it is not worthy. Since the beginning of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had been using the same lighting and the same type of background. Seriously, I do not know if this man that Varma considers about enlightenment or not, or maybe he has no other lighting technique other than Gordon Willis GODFATHER. Everything is DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would a body use so many Dutch angles and close-up extreme shots !!!!!!! The shooting division is lame. The characters can not carry an emotion, the performances are not within reach, the storytelling is worse, the background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz has been very prioritized in his work. VARMA produced great villains such as Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to carve the best characters of all time in Hindi cinema. There is no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a villain rather than a villain, he still has a soft corner for his brother (it's a gift in this movie). The performance of Amitabhz is not your brand. Its appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on his nose symbolizes forgotten cinema villains in black and white. What once worked in Babban is not successful. Babban is not comparable to Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The best thing about this character is not to put the audience on hold on their hands. If varma did that, it would be like teaching ABCD to a bachelor's degree holder. It's good that he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor as a mohanlal for his brand. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body bothers or at least considers this character. The total failure of the film begins when the director could not work on the close friendship between our heroes. These characters do not carry anything to this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading, decreasing. AAG can totally be treated as a C grade film. Sholay is a fire of revenge, the problem of a city, which means a true friendship and an annoyance and fun much appreciated by Dharmendra. AAG never brought an emotion with its characters. The storytelling is too weak for the audience to feel no sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with sholay, you still will not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to see this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
