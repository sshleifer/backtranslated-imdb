Normally, hg is an exploiter and has never really bothered me; I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudosciences or heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man with spasms caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I liked "Carrie" (the novel and the movie) but it bothered me. I think it's because the main character is developing a power line esp. Also the university professor wastes his time studying esp cases. I was not alive in the '60s to know first hand if the esp was a common fallacy at the time, but I suppose any theory of that nature would simply be discredited. What really bothered me was the way the police described the schizophrenics as relentless and unpredictable villains who may look like normal people 99% of the time and then simply disappear. Could not be farther from the truth. I detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. Many people still think that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts in the movie. I liked the way the witch used men; It was a nice change. I liked how she could become attractive, but she did not do it when she was close to her forced lovers. I found it interesting how his second lover also burned his face. If the script had been touched up for a few weeks before the production and he had not focused solely on making his audience more foolish, this could have been a decent movie.
