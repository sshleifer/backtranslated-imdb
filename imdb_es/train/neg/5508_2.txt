Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to get into serious television reports. When a job he pleaded for goes awry, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also says sayonara. Upon returning home, Tim is surprised to discover that his house has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars. Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But, Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. The lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees the opportunity to make time with Tim, but the course of true love does not develop smoothly in this case either. Soon everyone on television is harassing Tim, waiting for a story about a true alien. What should a man do? For those who loved the old television show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. It is truly, without a doubt horrible, without argument and relies on the supposed special effects that also fall flat. Daniels is fine as an Earthman, but Lloyd is simply terrible as an extraterrestrial, exaggerating a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, the set and the production details. Even if your children see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to choose another movie in the video store. Rest assured that children and adults will find this film a colossal bore, so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days.
