I have read comments that you should not see this movie if you are looking to shake the Shakespearean dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the moving dialogues contained in this wonderful work have been cut and replaced with songs. I have read this work and recently I was lucky enough to see it performed, as it is still one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this movie seems to take away everything I like about it. The princess, although she did not hesitate to do what she was ordered, did not have real behavior, and all the girls seemed to lose the cunning of their characters, also affected by reckless cuts, which not only deprived the female characters of the already scarce dialogue. but he took the comments out of context: it was a bit disconcerting to hear the Princess proclaim; "We are wise girls to make fun of our lovers!" When the mockery had not taken place at all. The news throughout the film also interrupted the flow and eliminated many excellent scenes, since they showed the information in the later scenes and were in modern phrases. In conclusion, an excellent play, ruined by a strange concept, and reckless cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking?
