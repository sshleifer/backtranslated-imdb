When I sat in front of the television watching this movie, I thought: "Oh, what could Alfred Hitchcock have done, or even Brian DePalma, with this!" The possibilities are, you will too. It starts intriguing. A British ranger who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty and demure brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom he met in a park a short time ago. Then, one day she disappears. The police can not find any documentation that she existed, and Firth conducts his own search. So far so good. Just as he is about to give up, he turns to his best friend of a woman (Billy Zane), and they stumble upon his previous life in the sordid underground drug, nightclubs and funniest movies in Los Angeles, and then with his story of mental instability. . At that moment, Firth's life is in danger, and the movie falls apart. None of Lisa Zane's past characters is remotely interesting. The movie moves slowly, and there is very little action. There is a secondary plot regarding the money missing from the drugs, but it is only a disposable one. Without persecutions, without hanging sequences, and without suspense. Just some beatings and a lot of chat for boring characters. One thing worth mentioning, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers, but they never appear in a scene together. At the end of the movie, you're torn between wondering what could have been and trying to stay awake.
