I am a big fan of terror and splashes, I even enjoy horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like gore. The more the better, as long as you have a point. <br /> <br /> After reading the comments of other people on the site, I was sure that this movie would be a little gem. But to my disappointment, it turned out to be one of the most useless movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was useless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years. Usually, I find that all these characteristics make a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I put 11 EUR to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really enjoy mindless gore (for example, violent "sh * t" movies) avoid at any cost!
