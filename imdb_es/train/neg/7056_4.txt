This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong. I really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add-on that was fun as hell but the movie was not as good as half. <br /> <br /> The weird part is that the jokes are really funny, the parodies of The Smoking Ban, Jo Bole ... etc. They are really good jokes, but I do not know who to blame for this failure of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors) and actresses (actresses) and not even the funny guy 2) The director 3) The boy who chose the actors and / or the director Anyway, if you're really bored and really want to see this movie, or get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh at them because they will be much more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps, the only salvation of this movie is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
