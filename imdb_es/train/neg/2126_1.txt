Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to choose him as a tender romantic protagonist. The fact that he dances so well, that he sings so effectively, and throws himself to the part so completely in some way, only made it seem more spooky. In his most beautiful moments (with the girl at the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I could not take my eyes off him, it was so repellent. You're still waiting for him to give up the good boy act and he starts to growl. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you watch a production of the musical stage, the 1963 film and this 1995 film, you will see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
