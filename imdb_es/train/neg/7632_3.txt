Many people see this as a classic, but obviously I must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty boring, which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will also be quite boring. What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last exhibition of images in Anarene is closed, there really will not be anything to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) points to that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans about how to lose their virginity, sometimes between themselves and others with some of the equally bored adults in the city. You see, there's not much to do for them, except to have sex (sometimes between them and other times with bored teenagers) or complain about the soccer team at the local high school. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add a little bit of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) escape, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a girl, but nothing. It really happens because of that. The only thing that added something of dramatic value to the film came to an end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little city, while men stare at the body debating where. to go to breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is supposed to indicate how gray this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Funds, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (Other than that, it was frightening to see how Quaid resembles, in 1971, his character from Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation films). Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
