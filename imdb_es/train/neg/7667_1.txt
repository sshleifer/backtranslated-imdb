The definition of an abomination as defined in Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of loathing or disgust". If someone can think of a word or definition more appropriate than this for Alone in the Dark, let me know because it is the best thing that comes to mind. However, I do not feel that, in any case, this word describes how truly horrible this film is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has tastes very similar to me, the other is a guru of the action / adventure movie. This last type usually does not care about the size of the holes in the weft, as long as the film contains many explosions, it will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Having said that, we entered the theater for the Friday visit. of Alone in the Dark. Little to my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why immediately. <br /> <br /> Start with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately, I have to admit that it only gets worse with that. The initial scene is a 5-minute scroll text that is narrated. However, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only the illiterate could even determine the idea of ​​PAYING to see this movie. However, this first scene is not only the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems as if we are listening in the same sequence to separate the films completely. One is about an ancient civilization and its manipulation of a portal, the other is about a mad scientist and his experiments with orphans. If you are reading this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then the horrible plot, the acting, the effects and the work with the camera begins. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. She does not do anything even for a second to make you think that she is a curator of the museum. Slater is simply bad, not convincing and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing that man has created. All the time, me and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what is happening? Apart from this displacement garbage, we have some narrated sequences of the same Slater. Are they well? DO NOT. Do they explain something? DO NOT. At some point, as a public, do we have the slightest indication of why we should worry about what happens? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they act as if they care about each other. But then BAM ... sex scene. Once again, I do not know. <br /> <br /> A good one, oh, I do not know, 30 seconds after the unfortunate scene ends, we have a shootout with 20 or more soldiers and a similar number of alien things. This is set in a heavy metal track and causes more cerebral hemorrhage than has ever been thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that was not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no main villain. There is the scientist and there are "extraterrestrial" things. At one point, the scientist controls the strange things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military post. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to you? Once again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the alien things break through? Did the military tell them? Who knows ... and at this point who cares? I did not and you will not. <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it was said that strange things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it, it's half the day * and% and it's brilliant as it can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. <br /> <br /> Now, when the movie was over, I ran out of the theater, all 6 inches 6 inches from me, waving. My arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to see this movie. Even my gung-ho action / adventure roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of an explosion in 1 movie as the greatest thing ever created) admitted that the holes in the plot were very evident in this movie. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST, I give it a 0.0 / 10 and I would give it lower if I could. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the worst movie ever made. I would not want this movie on my worst enemy.
