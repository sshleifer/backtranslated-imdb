Seeing a picture of a man being attacked by zombies gave me the hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could live up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, apart from the close-ups of a rotten corpse, there is little to recommend in this story of the murder of a rich man and the search of his daughter to find out who killed him. None of the characters is attractive and, when you discover how they did it (that turn, at least, it was great), you stop worrying. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!
