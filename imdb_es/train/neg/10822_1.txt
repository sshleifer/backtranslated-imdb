Jane Eyre_ is one of the best novels in English and this scriptwriter should read it. I hate when writers use Spark's notes to talk about a novel. This movie is unbearable to see if you've read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole 'red room' is so badly interpreted that I wonder why they bother to put it on. In the book, the 'red room' is prefiguring the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is so badly treated in the movie that I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most attractive characters and it was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing in his life and in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, lose this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it.
