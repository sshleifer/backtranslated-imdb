The film opens with a single long take of corridors in a factory full of workers. My, what we have done with the planet that could think.

When you're not watching a horribly filmed angle of the narrator in a conference room, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different places. It would be good if you chose areas that fit your subject, but he does not. Then, you will hear more narrations, you will see a few photos go by and you will see how he configures his camera. Why not use the camera to show more landscapes? It really kills any feeling of rhythm and paints it as a fool. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how someone sets up their camera, move quickly through this whole movie and lose much less time.
