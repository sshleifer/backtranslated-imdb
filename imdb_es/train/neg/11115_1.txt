A previous critic called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he / she saw the same movie as me. "High Art" had to have the most depressingly implacable interiors since "Seven". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the clich√© of going to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before doing that, one has to see opium-den parties inhabited by people who apparently do not have a paid job but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit. Not to mention the icy looks of those types of family films, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, who know very well that they will be thrown at some point in the next 100 minutes. The film also states that the character of Sheedy has retired from professional photography for ten years. What did she do, retire at twenty?
