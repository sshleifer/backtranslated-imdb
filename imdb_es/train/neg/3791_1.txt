I can not vote on this because I would not see the garbage of these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this crap. Go to the forums of this movie and read where the cast members try to act as if they were watching the movie for the first time. A boy even responds to himself ... using the same name! There are messages in the forum that say he is as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (in any way). If this is the second film of the company, it should be better than the first. That means that the third movie should be much better. It's not like that, I've seen it. The only thing I want to know is how to distribute this garbage with the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie during the weekend is fine ... but do not try to market that garbage!
