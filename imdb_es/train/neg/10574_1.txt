With the exception of FAMILIA, this new season is worse than the First Season. I can not imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror, he can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless chaos, but this series gets worse with each exit. I can not imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and the team to go to work every day, striving to produce so much garbage. HISTORY! Is that asking too much? CHARACTER! How can we curse the fate of ANYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they are cut or whatever? Almost all episodes end with senseless blood loss, going for a total shock with no sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON for which we have been subjected to one hour of bloodshed. Even Dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and veered toward a pointless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and yields tend to be high-speed, while content is total shit. I have high hopes for VALARIE UNDER THE LADDER of Garris from the executive producer, but we'll see.
