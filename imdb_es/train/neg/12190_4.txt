One of Scorsese's worst. A medium thriller; The only thing I can recommend is for De Niro to play the psychopath. The ending is typically of this genre, that is, over the top, with another villain almost invincible and immune to pain. I did not like the original of the 60s, and this version was not a big improvement. I have no idea why Scorsese lost his time in a remake. On the other hand, considering how bad his recent films have been (I mean his boring Buddhist film and all of his new favorite actress, the blonde Di Caprio), this is not so bad in comparison. And considering that Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... it could have been much worse.
