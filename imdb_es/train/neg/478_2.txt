The competition for the worst Warner Bros movie, Kay Francis, is tough. I've only seen eight of them, but the comet on Broadway is the worst so far. The best part is that it is short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly dresses (of course) are fine. The cinematography of James Wong Howe is not. Kay Francis looks fat and much less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know otherwise, is good as a semi-resistant "burlesque" dancer (she looked more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The final shot: Kay Francis and her son (when did the boy learn that Kay Francis was his mother? Did I fall asleep?) Walking down a dirt road to a prison painted with misty sketches on a stage where the Fall is more than ridiculous. The whole movie is so cheap, so unlikely and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros. throwing garbage at the dollars they do not know, in Warner Bros's cynical estimation of them. that what they are getting is garbage.
