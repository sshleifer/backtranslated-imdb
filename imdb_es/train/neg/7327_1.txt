Moralismo of hard hand. Writers who use characters as spokespersons to speak for themselves. Predictable and heavy points of the plot (let's say five times faster). The imitation of a Britney Spears child. This movie has all the characteristics of a special rejection for life. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create an emotional and stimulating film about a difficult subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that one is a criminal for Definition is not necessarily a bad human being, and there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts a child's welfare first. However, his seriousness ends up being channeled into preacher dialogues and trivial situations planted to advance the plot. Decent production values ​​and the interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to achieve their goal when the script and performance are deflated. <br /> <br /> Logic is often committed to creating tension: first things first. he tries to blackmail Pablo so that he participates in his documentary in exchange for helping them to escape, and at the same time he basically tells him not to trust her because he is not helping them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man who runs away, Pablo is too influenced by a tantrum. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that she flee from capture, jail or deportation for her, but he is willing to risk all that to appease her when she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk above too permissive fatherhood. Third, when Charlie, Pablo's employer, gives Detective Bright the phone, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority. Did he really think she was persuasive? Oh, yes, I would have surrendered. Detective Wims of CCH Pounder could clean the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list the things that I liked. Um, I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is transvestism, always an advantage; The transvestism of youth, nothing less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie has to be when Cristina kicks the Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that, in a very minority cast (which I certainly appreciate a lot), the black character is the racist. It's a pity that he has simply thrown himself there and not been explored anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive and unconventional score, but nevertheless, in general it is not context specific, it does not improve the mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic and anguished lament. every time the main character is distressed, as if they think their performance does not show it enough: "In case you were not sure, he is upset and we have the musical keys to prove it". <br /> <br /> The dialogue based on clichés and stylized results in a depressing lack of subtext; Everything has to be explained in the dialogue, even when the body language has been active until it is transmitted well. For example, every passionate speech Paul makes, and Mrs. Knight regrets that her son is not going to go to bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Daddy, tell me about Mom again', how cheeky! Brazen exhibition that presents the generic dead wife! (She's always the most beautiful woman the widower has ever seen, the kindest woman I've ever met.) Why can not we see a man crying for a woman like Shakespeare's? She can be fat, ugly, hateful, but her Love for her is Deeply like the oceans? Now there is a story that would move me. <br /> <br /> The police, literally being one step behind them, gives many scenes the feeling of a French farce outside The most boring chases of the foot: Bright and Lightning are out of shape and are so easy to fool (certainly not as fast as lightning, and she, well, do not feel the need to explain things). that drags a little boy overcoming a bicycle policeman, with a macho motorcyclist fighting in a fight but then being shot by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, that is so sad, will we ever see this in 'Cops'? <br /> <br /> Deus ex machina pirated and ex agerado: as an employer, should you really give up checking your green card just because you can quote the author of the poster? An inspiring poster on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> In addition, several scenes, including the previous one, threaten to become pornography: 'Well, I will do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me ...' I can almost hear the sound of laughter From the mother, the death of the grieving mother is the most real thing that the film feels. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she is completely influenced by her emotional speech until she becomes furious. A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly surprised by the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of the plot: opening a convenience store without a mask, visiting the grave of the dead girl. And why does not the mother recognize her face when she saw him before he left? 'You seem very familiar ...' <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of that totally unnecessary scene, something free with Soid and the bartender artificially improved? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary traits that never got anywhere, Detective Lightning says skeptic The Detective Bright must be a Scorpio that shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I do not think that believing in destiny qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright stops Pablo when he dies, wait, why does he care now? His character is as inconsistent as Soid's. What, she has to shoot him just because she said 'Stop or I'll shoot'? (Until now he has cared a lot about his integrity.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's infantile acceptance of her mother's death gives Dr. Knight peace about the death of his daughter, so forced. And the idea of ​​the family whose son was murdered became Cristina's new family ... I'm angered that she can be a "replacement" for her little girl. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to accept the Latin daughter of the man who killed her own daughter. I'm not saying there are not generous and loving people to do that. I'm just saying that the characters here have never developed enough for me to believe they would. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb critic would say that, of course, as a woman she was moved. for the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do not become sentimental in an artificial way. <br /> <br /> The co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebot said that he himself wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can spoil the broth, but a cook could only end up making a special for after school. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the title of this film has less to do with history and more with history. Feeling of regret, impotence and loss that accompany the revelation that you will never see your money again.
