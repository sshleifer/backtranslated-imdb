This movie was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it could not get worse, they added more joints and more pink vans with diffuse lines. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. They tricked us into thinking we were Supervan, the host's box that promised l√°sares, jail cuts and much more. Who would have thought that a Dollar Store Christmas present could have been so much fun!
