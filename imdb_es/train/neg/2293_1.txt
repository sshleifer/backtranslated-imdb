If this series is supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The animated series, I, for one, believe that it failed terribly. The character's drawing is lousy ... (Catwoman, for example, it looks awful ...) But what really bothered me is that it made Batman look like some sort of wimp who simply can not take care of himself in a battle, without the help of two, even three buddies. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be allies of Batman, besides Robin, but still ... making Batman say he needs help from them ... What, can not stand some blows? In BTAS, you could face a dozen opponents without any problems ... Are you getting old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I really do not think Batman allows a child like Tim Drake to enter the battle so quickly, without years of hard training. One, is irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, is not what happened in the comics, if we want to remain faithful to them. <br /> <br /> Batman: the animated series made history. With his animation, his stories and his characters ... That really was a Batman legend. The series New Adventures turned the legend into just another Batman movie.
