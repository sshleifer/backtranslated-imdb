Let me start by saying that this movie has a comic point from the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Eh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I new George. Study too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the paper? George: New George just luck, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's the only fun part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But, again, I am easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I would not say this is the worst movie I've seen (that title goes to the very nasty movie Disaster ...), this movie is number 7 on my list of the last 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who is easily entertained, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a moviegoer who wants a good and funny movie, you will end up shooting yourself in the middle of the movie.
