That word "True" in the title of this movie sounded my alarms. They sounded louder when a title card referred to the United States Civil War as the "War between the States" (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James, thief, slave owner and murderer, is described as a quiet and gentle peasant. <br /> <br /> How dishonest is this movie? Slavery is NOT mentioned, much less the documented fact that Jesse James's poor mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank fought actively to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really struggling to decide if Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's ALL. (Missouri: It's a sweet mint! It's a breath mint!) Blacks are totally absent from this movie, except for two flashes of a pair of beggars, one of which bears a "HELP TO THEM" sign. POOR ", which is very unbelievably typographical instead of written. (Some photos of nineteenth-century newspapers are also inaccurate, with the type sources of the twentieth century). <br /> <br /> This movie has a strange flashback structure. There are some very impressive tricks (and a good job of the horses), and an excellent assembly. I savored a line of dialogue: 'Some of those children will never try beans again'. The film shows some data: Agnes Moorehead, like Jesse's mother, hides her right arm in scenes after the Pinkerton agents 'raid (here called' Remington ') in which Jesse James' real-life mother He suffered injuries that required amputation. of his lower arm. Some mistakes here are forgivable: during his assault days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stylus. I've seen a picture of Jesse James's real wife; If she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange in this movie, Jesse James could have stayed more at home. <br /> <br /> Here is a lot of revisionism, and most male actors wear hairstyles from the fifties. But many of the mistakes in this movie were preventable. Jesse James's mentor, William Quantrill, is mentioned several times, but all actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife move into an elaborate two-story house (where he will soon die) after paying a $ 18 rent. Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St. Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-story country house, which is rented for $ 14. There was no upper floor ... so, when Jesse James is murdered, his wife could not come running from the top floor like Hope Lange does here . (Actually he was in the kitchen) <br /> <br /> A Continuity Error: Robert Wagner (no double trick) does an awesome job of putting a bullet in his jaw and falling while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope that joins his wrists has vanished. <br /> <br /> The script does some strange and unnecessary juggling of dates. After the attempted robbery in Northfield, Jesse says he hopes to get home before his birthday. The actual raid on Northfield Bank by James Gang (September 7, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James' birthday. (Maybe he was referring to next year's birthday). Later, we see Jesse and his wife move into their home in San Jose on an excellent summer day, while Jesse tells him what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse James moved into that house on December 24, 1881 ... so this scene should * BE * on Christmas Eve! These errors were totally avoidable. <br /> <br /> Some of the fictions here do not make sense. According to this film, the Northfield bank raid failed because a (fictional) henchman was slow to cut the telegraph cables. If this had happened, in fact it would have hindered the escape of James Gang ... but it would not have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons. <br /> <br /> Here are good performances from Jeffrey. Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and theater actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, usually an underrated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has shown his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, it seems he can not decide whether to describe Jesse James as a good or a bad ... so do not get too upset. John Carradine talks about his acting in a brief role as a fictional preacher who baptizes Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a complement. <br /> <br /> Jesse James was not Robin Hood. (I doubt Robin Hood was Robin Hood, but that's another story). There is not a single documented example of Jesse James sharing his booty with someone beyond his own family. After some of his robberies, he did not even split the booty with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse is shot dead right after he swears to give up his bandits forever. Actually, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. In preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor people who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his generosity. I shrugged off a scene here, in which the fictitious Jesse James is so refined that he disapproves of an oil painting that shows nudes with good taste. <br /> <br /> 'The True (not much!) The story of Jesse James is willingly dishonest about a murderous thief, and also dishonest about the Civil War. For the impressive work of trick, a good assembly and a few turns of good acting, I will qualify this film obscenely dishonest 2 points out of 10.
