This was not fun in 1972. Now it is not. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I am not criticizing the film because it is incredibly sexist. I quote that I enjoyed a little, or rather, I enjoyed the reaction that it generates in the annoying PC people. I am attacking it because it is badly written and acted. <br /> <br /> The only really memorable character is Blakey, which the 25-year-old British will recognize immediately since he was a favorite among the Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
