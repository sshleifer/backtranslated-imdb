This was another big screen output for a US television program. UU From the sixties. It's funny enough, but it was very similar to the formula. From his point of view, the intelligent Martian lands on Earth and encounters humans not too bright. <br /> <br /> The usual madness occurs with the human Bridges, who eventually joins him and helps him get home. On the way, he also takes the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a good outlet for some nice Hollywood stars that I had not seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Nice enough to pass. Some free time if you do not have anything better to see.
