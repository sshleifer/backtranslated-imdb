I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of "romance" and "western" with some landscapes of the Grand Canyon. But if you're expecting a typical healthy and typical western, forget it. This movie is pure garbage! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL that has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE AGED MAN! The child is also coveted by other leering men. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as a virtuoso in trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is primarily the one who pursues the relationship. He tries to scare her at first, but finally he gives up and they leave as a happy and loving couple. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie could attract anyone, except pedophiles.
