There is no possible reason to understand why this movie was made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue to produce a horrible update from one classic to another? (Cases in question: Mr. Magoo, The Avengers - horrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually enjoy, was so unfortunately misinformed in this role. His manic portrait of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so indescribably unsatisfying to be almost criminal. His ranting, groans, grimaces and histrionics give us no reason to take care of his character, except as a one-dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that the quick movements, the screaming dialogue and "one shot" "slapstick had some similarity to the comedy." Apparently, he told EACH ACTOR to act like they had red ants in the pants. <br /> <br /> The flaw must be in the script done in an irresponsible way.I think the writer used "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good comedy script. As manic as that 1963 classic is, it is far superior to this trap, in fact, it suddenly looks pretty good in comparison. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movie is that it must have been written to attract young children, I'm just not sure for whom the children were made, I'm certainly not a self-respecting child who carries a card, I know! <br /> <br /> If they had to redo "My Favorite Martian", why did not you add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not consider "zero" as a rating for its readers, it is the only rating that comes to mind when describing this spoof. <br /> <br /> A good What came from this movie, the actors and the team were paid, I think.
