If I wanted to be exact, I should have chosen some natives of Frisco and not a group of New York actors who do not know anything about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in SF all my life, and the people here do not speak or act as these actors did. Everything was too dramatized, and the only cat I saw in the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. I'm not surprised that he was the only one in the movie who really dressed like a cat here (ie, his Warriors shirt). Not once did I realize that someone was wearing a Giants or 9ers team; instead, he placed them in SF or Oakland jerseys made with cheese that are not even sold around here. HP does not have bowling alleys, black and Asian gangsters do not wear heads or wristbands with the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, nor do all Chinese gangsters wear a Yao Ming shirt and try to sound black while shooting rings In addition, although there is now an important Yuppie community that has invaded the Mission, all that was shown was a white guy and a self-proclaimed "100% of the west coast of Boriqua." This is NOT New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the ONE that was shown here, which was undoubtedly from New York. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. A precise representation would have shown the drama between the HP games in their own hood and also against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if Lee had done something else. task and had a better story to work with.
