Each generation fully believes that it is living in recent times. This has been true for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on this. How did you get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train crash? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. Try to link the prophecies as best you can with what happened at the time it was made, which makes it obvious and a bit silly. <br /> <br /> The recreations seem to be out of "Unsolved Mysteries" But without the high production values. People should have been ashamed to participate in this. <br /> <br /> In summary, the film is old-fashioned, silly, reactionary and useless. Good if you want to laugh, but not enough to look for it.
