This is one of those movies that I remember being in the can for years before something happened to her. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is, at best, somewhat weak. The cast is pretty good at what they're given, but again you're as good as the script. Baldwin addressed this, although he could have sworn he did not do everything. I thought I had read somewhere or that many repetitions were not bad, but it definitely has some potential. Although his work in "30 Rock" is just a genius and should keep him busy for a while longer. I just hope that the show gives up with grace to the Seinfeld, but maybe not even that much. 9 years left. So, if you want to see a movie that you will not get much of, but you will not hate either, this is for you. I can not remember the last time a movie had been wrapped so long before it was finally released and only on DVD. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins together again, as their excellent but not many people have seen "The Edge". Now pick up that excellent movie for true entertainment.
