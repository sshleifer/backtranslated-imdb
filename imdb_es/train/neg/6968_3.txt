An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. He is stung by him, or bitten by something in him. He quickly gets sick, and spits out a large twisted larva of some kind in the hospital. A subsequent attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a blood spatter. <br /> <br /> A policeman is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in a shooting. Somehow, the police meet with one of the doctors, as well as an entomologist who is admitted. There are several small children wandering around the hospital, which I suppose we should find adorable, but which are extremely annoying. Bikers happen to wander in the room where the sample is stored and discharge a growth hormone into it. The logic of horror movies would say they deserve to die for this, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> The creature grows and begins to reproduce. People run away from it and, sometimes, for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by military personnel who are prepared to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems that people are looking for the monster. It was pretty boring. Clearly, something is due to the Alien films, since the monster is born within a human being and has several stages of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the main actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
