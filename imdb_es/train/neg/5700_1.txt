How this movie earns a rating of 6.7 is incredible. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and it should clearly be among the worst 100 IMDb movies of all time. National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and just one more assault on Hollywood by Hollywood. Critics spoke of the holes in the plot by which you could drive a 16-wheeler. <br /> <br /> I love the justifications for this film to be good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute". Come on folks, it's no wonder that people all over the world think Americans are stupid. This has to be the stupidest and most insulting movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The National Treasure unfortunately received much more publicity than those fantastic movies. I bet most of you who read this have not heard of them, since some of them have not yet been widely released. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is an excellent actor, when he is in the right movies. Again and again I have seen Cage squander his great talent in frightening films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is put to good use, as in Charlie Kaufman's adaptation, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> In a few words: I prefer that my hand becomes a wood chipper than in submitting to this visual atrocity again.
