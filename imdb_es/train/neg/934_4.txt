Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as ever. Ritter was not bad either. What was his name was as beautiful as ever. It could have been a good movie. To the bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was presented as a child's painting through the routine of numbers. The characters were pieces of cardboard cut out. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the performance, which was a shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, very bad, the screenwriter was not the victim. Especially with the "precocious" lines of the child, which were completely incredible. <br /> <br /> Once again, only the performance prevented a much lower score.
