"The Crush" is a romantic movie for girls of 40 and so many friends that is nice enough for the first two thirds, as it tries to be a British "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I particularly enjoyed the turn of the young trophy, whose character is not very developed (on second thought, we did not see so much physical flesh of him and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more than). <br /> <br /> I'm sure they deal much more with young people / women than what was done in the "Sabrina" version (neither of the two movies that I like) or in the case of Douglas / Zeta -Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. <br /> <br /> Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex-pat to the contrary, they are welcome relatives of British dramas and comedies, such as Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot turns towards the end, it feels very deus ex machina. But it was not until the credits came at the end that I realized what could really be wrong. As with "Sex and the City", the writer / director is a man, here, Scottish John McKay, who is the first player and I think he really wanted to make a script about three homosexual men, probably about his relationship with his lovers. and at work (the characters are the director of a school, a policeman and a doctor), what would have been a better and more interesting film. The working title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would have made its parallels with the gay "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 6/6/2002)
