I suppose it is possible that I have seen worse movies, but this is a real plague! The plot is nothing special, but that is not the worst. the address is not close to what you would expect from Andy Ching. He is able to do a good job, but he could not put together this movie. <br /> <br /> Angie Harmon, playing the female lead as a reporter who finds out who is behind the president's murder, really destroyed the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, his behavior was flat and wooden, and the 5-inch heels he wore throughout the film were absurd. This output for Harmon places it solidly at the end of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> And what was Goody thinking? he has a series of outstanding performances to his credit, but this was much lower than what we have expected from him. <br /> <br /> poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor
