First, the CGI in this movie was horrible. I saw it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. In the end, when the park owner dies, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no argument. Why were they on that particular island? Well, it was not declared in the movie. And, why would people keep coming to the cat area? Has no sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a movie "B made for TV movie", the performance was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It can be good for some memorable appointments.
