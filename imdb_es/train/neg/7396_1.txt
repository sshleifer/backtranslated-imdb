Unfortunately, I agree with the criticism written by halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film, the cinematography, the costumes, the stage, the sound, the editing and everything else is very, very good. This may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical team that worked on this consisted of professionals, so the quality is to be expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The thing is that it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of cinema, SHOW a story) you need argument and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: the events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that observes humanity. That's. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of showing us a story, we are simply learning things about this guy from Tim Watcher. Of course, given the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough background on him, so the film resorts to voice-over narration. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which is to give information that we would never otherwise obtain. In fact, if it were not for the VO, we would think that the character was just a crazy old man who was out there looking at things. To make matters worse, the VO also explains what is happening on the screen. The images we show are just a decoration for the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I can say that this short film would be a good video for a band or something, but because the images do not do it. You can not say that. What remains, obviously, has value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew (not unbelievable, but good) but it does not entertain, entertain, excite or, at least, show a story.
