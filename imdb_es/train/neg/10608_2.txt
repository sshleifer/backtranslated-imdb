I do not think any Van Damme movie outperforms the Universal Soldier, but you never know. This movie was good but not as good as the 1st. VD returns a Luc and must fight again. He tries 2b funny here, but maybe it's worth to smile. VD has a son this time from Ally W., well, he showed a picture of them 2. Goldberg was great, he makes his famous movement, he forgot what he's called because he does not watch wrestling. VD and Goldberg had some good fights. It was the end like the first, but not so good. VD makes his best move in his career, as always: the HELICOPTER KICK. Even though, the final ending should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing it but it will never surpass the original.
