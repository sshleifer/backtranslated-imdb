Whoever wrote the script of this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood (he does not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept watching to see if it would improve, which, unfortunately for me, does not. <br /> <br /> Even in the end, the credits gave my anxiety I guess there were not many people behind the movie, so they had to pass the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely an excellent guide to "How not to make a movie". Too bad I can not give a 0.
