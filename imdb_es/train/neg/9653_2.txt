I wonder what is the purpose of making movies like this. the profit? And to whom do you refer what intelligence your brain must use to see something like this shit? This movie can be seen by children under 3 years if you are an adult, do not try to see it. That's the reason why I think Hollywood started using cartoons in movies with actors like this. You must forget the art of cinema, make sure you have tons of popcorn to consume and spend time until this movie ends. This movie can be easily used in a restaurant, but certainly not in a movie theater, my dog ​​that is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building. The truth is that this film refers to people without demands of the art of cinema. The only thing this film can be used is to see it when the shopping list is made in the supermarket. I give it 2 stars for supporting the efforts of Indian cinema, but nothing more or less.
