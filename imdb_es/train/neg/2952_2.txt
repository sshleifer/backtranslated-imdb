Since you only saw the trailer to Theodore Rex, you would think it was a police comedy of friends with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. That's true, but it's mainly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever with its directional style and strange character designs. It was badly marketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, rather than a boring comedy of cops. Whether this movie is badly marketed or not, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have come back to life through incredible technology, and they talk and walk like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who never takes himself seriously, but after a dinosaur is killed, he is given the case to work, but he has to be the toughest police officer of all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It depends on this duet that does not match to solve the murder, and it is up to the audience to stay awake long enough to overcome this problem. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the movie as a normal acting character, but in the end it's unbearable to listen. For some reason, besides being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad mimic. He does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly horrible lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and says: "It's not my butt trumpet!" Woohoo! What a puerile, immature line, even for a children's film of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I expected Teddy to bite his head throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and action take place, there is no comedy or humor. In any scene that is not action, the characters try to be as fun as they can, which only results in a direct and direct boredom. The action scenes do not work because they are too strange and not violent enough, and as stated before, comedy is just a bunch of slaughtered jokes. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> Having a duo of dinosaurs / human detectives seems like a very original movie, if nothing else. No This movie is a big scam of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaurs with cartoons, and configure them in the future, and it's exactly the same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and a detective solve the murder, a toon and a detective solve the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who seems to be Christopher Lloyd and guys who act like weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit walks the stage, is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a great scam of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad movie, which does not even deserve to be directly to the height of VHS. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG for mild violence, language and raw humor.
