A serial killer dies in a blizzard and becomes the evil twin of Frosty the Snowman. Then he goes on a wave of murders. Interesting plot It sounds scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old Otherwise, it's a bit corny. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low budget movie that can be turned into a cult movie. I'm sure he has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in that. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes that I found funny. As the scene of the bathtub and the scene after the explosion with the reference of Picasso. It was also nice to observe the many ways in which the heroes try to kill Jack and he just does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a horror of low-budget B movies.
