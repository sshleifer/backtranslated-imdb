I had the suspicion that the movie was going to be bad. I have been a Duke fan for a long time. Have three years of the television series on DVD. Well, I was right. He took the family to see him. I really wanted to see the General Jump again and some of the chase jumping scenes were good. But to summarize, the movie was a silly and silly version of the television show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that Daisy's original outfit was equally revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must also be rolling in their graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are an old Duke fan like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
