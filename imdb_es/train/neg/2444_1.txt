Two houses, a street, a phone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is a little blue light, ambient music and ... done. But not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get a little alcohol, get some movie-loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst that cinema can offer. For such an afternoon, this peace of filth is one of the best. Guaranteed laughs! <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that Van Rouveroy continues to defend his film as if it were a great achievement. To witness this, you will have to listen to the comment track on the DVD. Again: do not believe and laugh guaranteed!
