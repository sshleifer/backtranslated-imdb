This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. The performance was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any annoying emotion. At the beginning of the movie, I was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she shook her head with her lower lip extended. She sobbed unhappily without tears over the crying scene. I was almost angry because of all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to tear it up. Everyone else suffered from too much action too. It was totally annoying. It was also an insult for the skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they chose her as a person who is part of the Olympic team. It is practically spitting the effort that real skaters put into their work. An unfortunate excuse for a movie and an unfortunate attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve a star.
