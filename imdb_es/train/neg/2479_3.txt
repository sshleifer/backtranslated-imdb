I learned for the first time from Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Stories of Fear" books: according to that story, the Wendigo, after pronouncing your name in the wind, drags you, and then drags you to the sky and it pulverizes you. you. While it sounds like a rather strange idea, Schwartz's story made it a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" does not. It basically consists of every cliche of horror movies: the family moves into a new house and strange things start to happen, anyone who harms them asks for it, and it is better that everyone listen to the old Indian. I have seen this so many times that I no longer bother to tell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in "Malcolm in the Middle") have done much better than this.
