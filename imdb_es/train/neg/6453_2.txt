There is almost nothing to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to see and can actually act, although his role in this mess is a waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast goes from bad to mediocre. In many movies like this, someone will shine through the material and you will take note of them for future reference. There is no such luck here. Unknown creature ", a clich√© of a monster movie in which children are shot down one after another.The monster is a man in a rubber suit that recalls the days of Paul Blaisdell.What good, good! The rest The show It's so bad that it's bad A bit of humor could have made this more acceptable, but everyone plays the boring stuff from the beginning There's a twist or two at the end, but by then you will not care anymore.
