When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. Then I had the misfortune to see the damn thing. I love the books of M. C. Beaton about the wonderful agent of Scotland. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well written. The powers that are responsible for this mix have apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively strong. It seems that the actors feel that they should shout their lines and shout at each other. If you love the adorable Hamish Macbeth of M. C. Beaton, do not waste your time with this garbage.
