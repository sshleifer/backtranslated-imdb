Hanna-Barbera takes the life of another famous property. The violence is diluted, the stories are fictional, the animation is bad, the music is hateful and repetitive, and frankly, the show is not fun. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB put everything. of his series through the same clich√© situations, regardless of whether it fits the world of the cartoon or not. Therefore, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("Hey, Popeye is popular, and Flinstones are popular, put them together, and you can not miss them!"). In addition, in an apparent scam of "Private Benjamin", Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that presents them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> In addition to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in each episode (standard practice at the time of the cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye gives a lecture to his nephews about how to safely cross the street, recycle and, are you ready for this? - The dangers of smoking! (I swear I'm not making it up) <br /> <br /> The only remaining spell of the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the first days, continues here. <Br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look once to get a new appreciation for Fleischer's old shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
