I have left very few movies before they finish, but I could not finish this piece of garbage. This was the biggest charge of racism that he tried to pass as a legitimate movie since "The Birth of a Nation." The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see how any actor would want his name to be associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to make him take out garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do ... like looking at dry paint. I would like someone to make a movie about interracial relationships that deals with the subject in a realistic way. There is much more in depth on this subject: the superficial tirade of a bitter director like Lee.
