Last night I saw free money and it was the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought a gift was waiting for me, especially because I'm a Brando fan. INCORRECT! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to see him sometimes (like the cattle scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous settings (why did not they show the character of Charlie Sheen towing Brando's truck again?) Ugh. Try to be a slapstick comedy, but I just was not accepting. Skip this. Only for Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still believe that the worst movie that was made was Skidoo.
