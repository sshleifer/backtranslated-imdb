Soft SPOILERS contained in this document. I'm spoiling this movie to save you the trouble of having to watch it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's films are divided into one of two categories: Shaolin period movies and films set in modern-day Hong Kong that revolve around triads or similar organizations. Each genre has its best and worst films. 'Twin Warriors' is the best Shaolin era movie by Jet Li, while 'The Evil Cult' is his worst performance. `Fist of Legend ', while in the recent past is the best movie of the modern era of Jet Li. 'Black Mask' is definitely the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a self-exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but shortens his lifespan. In his 'new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian. When his former mercenary squad becomes enraged, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He puts on a very stupid corrugated cardboard mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, as well as to hide his true identity from his former comrades in arms. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was bent, and horribly so. Why does Jet Li capture and hold as a hostage his library partner if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does not the chief of police care when he learns about the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is simply BAD. Bad for the superhero character, bad in the sense that the characters are never well developed, bad in their interactions, all crowned by a half-explained story in which I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> The action and the sequences of martial arts are far above. Much blood, gore (parts of the body cut in abundance), explosions and nuances of superhuman martial arts fiascos of Matrix are present in the film. Unfortunately this is the best movie and the only point of sale. If you want to see Jet Li play a watchful superhero in an impossible mission style movie, Black Mask offers. For the rest of us, fans of Jet Li is a real disappointment. This is one of those movies in which Jet Li never becomes Jet Li: he has neither the opportunity to charm us with his charisma, nor the opportunity to impress us with his impressive and realistic martial arts skill. <br /> <br /> Normally, a Chinese imitation of Ozzy Osbourne would suffice to absorb me into a movie, unfortunately 'Black Mask' turned out to be an exception to that rule. In fact, the antagonist of this film, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair and round designer sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne. However, the villain is not on the screen long enough to make the trick worthwhile. I suppose the resemblance to Ozzy was intentional; In addition to the villain's look, he also ran a satanic-looking hideout. You could have done much more with the trick of the villain Ozzy Osbourne! I wish the writer, director or ANYONE had bothered to give a background and develop the character of the villain of the movie! <br /> <br /> `Black Mask 'was Jet Li's first movie released on video in the United States after Deadly Weapon 4, and I'm glad I stayed away from him until now. It may have ruined my perception that Jet Li is an artist and martial actor. If you want to see Jet Li at his worst, rent "Black Mask" and "The Evil Cult" and turn it into a double characteristic or horror, both intentional and involuntary. Otherwise, stick to movements that use Jet Li's talents, and have plots that are almost well thought out and plausible. 3/9 stars.
