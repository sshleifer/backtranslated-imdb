I chose this because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a customer of Metasonix modular synthesizers (made by someone dear to me). The art of the jacket says "the 2003 version". <br /> <br /> I give it a point for a strong woman, a point for Cheezy's dialogue and a last point for Meg Foster's light blue eyes, of which there are many. It was fun to see David MacCullum swimming casually (the pool has a Plexiglas viewing window!), While a psychopath was chasing his beloved in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were marginally impressive, that is, houses of people rich in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I found myself wondering how they could maintain the cleanliness with all the dust that was blowing. The wind was not strong enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the animal skins on furniture should be unpleasant ... etc. and I realized that the movie must be pretty boring if I ask myself these things when the supposed plot was developing. I stumbled over things like, why did he light a fire, put out the match and then toss the match into the fire? Silly things like that. It was clumsy at best. Oh good. Robert Morely had a little fun with his witty character and a good vacation.
