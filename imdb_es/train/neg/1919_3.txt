I read the book a couple of times and this movie does not follow exactly what it should. I could leave this slide, it's after all a movie. However, I have serious problems with the configuration of the movie. No one seems to have mentioned that this film and the book it is based on are based on real events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this movie is supposed to be based. First, the "small" city that is spoken of as the stage is the third largest city in the state. With a population of around 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scenario for the movie is incorrect. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but I got angry seeing my hometown being treated so badly. This was a real event. Large sections of the city were eliminated. In the book they talk about riding a bicycle from Mormon Island to the Fonner Park. I suppose you could if you do not mind a trip of 15 miles each way. For anyone who wants to know what really happened, visit http://www.theindependent.com/twisters/
