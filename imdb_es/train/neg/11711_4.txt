A good movie, with an excellent protagonist, but a terrible protagonist. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the salvation of the movie. She is the best actress of the group. <br /> <br /> NOTE * the first comment, from the partner who praised the film (and, according to his IMDB.com account, he has only written ONE critique, and Guess which film?) is obviously a plant . Although the film is very well shot, it is not in any way subtle or brilliant or any other hypobolic description that the critic has used. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big joke. It offers all kinds of sexual situations but never goes through that. How to see a Skin Flick in Cinemax, but with all the "naughty bits" edited. <br /> <br /> The movie, in general, is a little out of focus and the end, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. There is a turning point, of course, since in all the movies of today it is necessary to have a turning point. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
