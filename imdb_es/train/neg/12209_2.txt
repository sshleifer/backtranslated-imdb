Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother had a policy that the person who chooses the movie should pay. And, although I would never pay to see some of the trash they took me to, I could not resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I got to see shit like Conan's second movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now, even though it is a miserable movie, it can be seen in entertaining places, in a totally deadly way. And, technically, acrobatics and camera work are good, so this raises my rating to 2! So, why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has practically no plot, the same Rambo only says about 3 words (apart from grunts and screams), there is an unnecessary and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance", and the movie is a giant (and stupid) special effect. And what special effects STUPIFYINGly AWFUL. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are fired at Rambo, none has any effect on him and almost all the bullets or arrows that Rambo fires reach their peak. And, while the bad guys are using AK-47, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes, all Rambo had was a bow and arrows with what appear to be nuclear props! The scene in which the only bad guy is shooting at him while slowly and calmly throwing one of these explosive arrows is specially designed for stupid spectators! It was marvelously parodied in UHF starring Weird Al. Also, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a fun parody of the genre, not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> In general, such a silly and meaningless film is almost like a self-parody. !
