Disney goes to the well too many times, because anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel flat. Celebrating the birth of his daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce him to King Triton. The celebration is quickly interrupted by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to obtain the King's trident. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows up wondering why she can not get in there. <br /> <br /> What this direct video sequence describes is terrible and terrible. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you see seems to have come directly from other Disney movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize himself! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walrus do not remind you of another duo of KING LION! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the real chef. They played it terribly! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give anything away, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly small and too difficult to handle. A disgrace for Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to stop renting and laughing. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels that Disney will drown you later.
