When I go to the video store to rent a movie, I usually trust the views of IMDb in a movie and, until the latter, I had never seen a movie with a rating of 7.0 or higher on the site that I did not enjoy. . <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the twentieth century, really made a mistake in committing one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can make: filling the cast of a movie with totally different characters unpleasant without any real redemption. <Br /> <br /> I like movies with defective characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is, we all have a little light there too, we're all in shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line filling this film with totally unpleasant and almost masochistic characters in black tone. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's Hank is an irresponsible, whining, immature and irresponsible 30-year-old man, divorced from a marriage with a wife who hates him and a daughter who believes he is a loser, which is very important His indecision and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he is too cowardly to do so, he himself leads directly to his plan of bank robbery crumbling and the mother being murdered. When he confronts his older brother at the end of the film, he is more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but he does not give much to work with, since he is presented as someone with a boot stamped on his face and he does not particularly care that he is there. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, your character's wife is equally bad. Almost every shot of the film he is in is when he verbally scolded him for the rent and child support money, and continued his self-esteem non-existent with insults. Seriously, that's all the character does. Its behavior of harpy limits with the malevolent one. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays his father Charles, and although Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends 90% of this movie with the same mouth. opens half grimace on his face as if suffering the worst constipation in the world. For someone who has been an actor as much as Mr. Finney, he believes that he would be more apt for emotion. Although he does not show it much, his character is supposedly afflicted and full of anger. And when he chokes Andy at the conclusion of the movie, it's as if Dr. Frankenstein puts the monster he helped create out of his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei does not have much to do with her character. Caught in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy's world starts to get out of control, it logically jumps off the ship, but in reality it does not make her less selfish or selfish than any other character in the movie, but it's probably the one with the most common sense. <br /> <br /> And finally we get to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, it's the only reason why I rated this film with a 3 instead of a 1. His performance as a heroin addict and embezzled financial executive is The "perfect crime" of stealing jewelry insured from their parents goes wrong is fascinating. His descent from the master planner calmed from a flawed scheme to an unstable and crazy homicidal maniac is credible and tragic. Hoffman's character ends up being the main villain of the film, but it's hard to take root against him, since the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who recognizes himself as a poor early father, which led to the eventual psychosis of his son and the indirect and involuntary murder of his mother. . <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is only worth seeing for the excellent performance of PSH and its family nature. Just do not expect there to be characters worth encouraging, because there really is not.
