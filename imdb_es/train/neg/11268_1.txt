I expected this movie to be at least visible. The plot was weak to say the least. I expected much more considering the cast's alignment (I wonder if any of them will include this in their CV). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and complete PANTS.
