This movie is as underestimated as the Moscow Police Mission to Moscow. This movie is never funny. It is perhaps the worst comedy parody ever made. Very boring, and silly beyond belief. For those people who think that this movie is underestimated, God help you. I give this movie * of **** <br /> <br />
