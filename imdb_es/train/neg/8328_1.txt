If you want to see a movie that is strangely shot, with strange lighting, strange stories of these men (and a woman) who enjoy outdoing each other, if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two types, one, one boxer and the other, a gay man, then you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, I almost felt so bruised and hurt, like the director (of the movie). turn me crazy <br /> <br /> This is a film in which one is not destined to observe a plot or a great performance, this is a film to gape with horror and amazement. Much like seeing a plane crash or train accident. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie, a good movie, a "B" movie, or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not. . <br /> <br /> A warning to all who watch this movie, do not eat in advance. You may want to vomit at the end of the movie.
