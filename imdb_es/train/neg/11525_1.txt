Simply terrible! Why would not you use real actors? Look, this has to stop! Stop using the non-actors! If you want any credibility or message sent through these low budget movies ... please, for the love of God, use real actors! Most will work for free ... take advantage of that! Now back to my comment ... anyway, the mood was lower than that of the bathroom variety and it was not fun at any level. As for quality ... in a scene shot on a public transport bus, you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? He was a guy with what looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume that the only audience for this movie are people with a gore fetish ... and it was not even a good gore.
