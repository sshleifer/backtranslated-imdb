This movie seems to have been an exercise in work training for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know if it should be a "A" or a "B" Western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for the love of God. William Boyd must be turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> All the Western "B" cliches are here. The pearl hero of two weapons in the white hat with the faithful steed ("C'mon Thunder"), the bearded villain all in black, the heroine in distress, the rancher in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, in the top bad guys , etc. <br /> <br /> The performance, with few exceptions, is strictly from the Yakima Canutt Performance School. Chris Lybbert (who?) Like the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As the villain it looks like they would have been more at home in a quickie of 30 Poverty Row. The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a bit, but they are not given enough to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Should we believe that Sheen's character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a great lover of westerns of all genres, I strived to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings seemed very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, the other characters seemed authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were going to resurrect the Cassidy character from Hopalong, they might have thought of portraying him as he originally wrote: a dirty-ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder, the kind of part that Lee Marvin would have excelled. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, but ... in Thunder, about a big man?
