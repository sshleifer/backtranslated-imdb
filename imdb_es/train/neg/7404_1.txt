Initially I gained interest in this film after reading a review that said that this film reminded the critic of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Silent Hill, and disappointed with his debut in the movie, I thought I would give him this one. an opportunity. Beware, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Dark Floors", not by its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought of the band (I had some college friends that they liked) but I did not think it was important and I quickly put aside the thought. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts strong. Despite the fact that "the creepy little girl" has been made with DEATH, the good use of audio and the feeling of isolation really began to unite the story. The tense atmosphere was quickly built, and all indications were that the movie was excellent. As the monsters are the true stars of horror, I could not wait to see what lurked in the corridors of the hospital in which the main characters were trapped ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster appeared , and I was very disappointed. When the second one appeared, I was surprised by the fact that it seemed to have come out of a Megadeth concert, and the stupidity turned me off completely. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, the atmosphere remained. intact, and the story left you wondering what was going on, but fears were practically nonexistent. However, I kept hoping that the end would be worth it. Unfortunately that was not the case. By the time the film reached its climax, I was in total disbelief, and I immediately recognized the great evil in its final revelation ... The lead singer of Lordi? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was that what the movie was reduced to? A group of poor souls persecuted in a hospital by members of Lordi's gang? The design of the silly monster suddenly made sense. If you're going to be so cheesy, so can Marilyn Manson's members, or even KISS, too. Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. Did they have to go and make a full movie? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I discovered what was really happening, all I could manage was a yawn. I'm not going to "ruin" it for you, but I can safely say that it's probably a plot device you've seen before. Most likely more than once. <br /> <br /> So, unless you're a big Lordi fan, get away from this. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does a good job of borrowing from other horror movies, mainly Silent Hill). And, I can not emphasize this enough, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Actually, it would be better if you were scared watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it simply is not possible.
