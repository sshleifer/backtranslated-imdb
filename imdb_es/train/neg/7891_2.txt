The plot summary of IMDb in no way describes the essence of this film. I should have read 'Prepare to be catapulted back to the third bank prison in the back of your family church at 8 years old, listen to the preacher speak about God's will while all he can think about is to return to home. your Lego. <br /> <br /> Start well intentioned, creating intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues like Renny's: "how was the cut of my thumb healed so fast?" moment. Then, slowly, it becomes a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a torrent of babbling induced by evangelism. I think I counted the use of the word "pray" some 53 times in a span of five minutes near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Unfortunately, this little mental game made the movie at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Also, it made me laugh every time a character said "prayer" ("prey" to me), since he became totally nutty. In fact, even my Catholic wife sank in her chair due to boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all salivating Christians who rated this movie from 8 to 10 stars, I suggest staying with it. its security standards that reinforce theology like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more brain-challenging subjects in movies like Jesus Camp, The God Who Was Not There, What Jesus Would Buy or the Next Release of Religulous. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Robert Whitlow's book is better.
