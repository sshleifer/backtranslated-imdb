I must be the only one in the United States who did not like this movie. I guess this was not my style or something, I just do not see what's fascinating, this was barely entertaining, let alone one of the biggest achievements in film history. <br /> <br /> This is a man who came from nowhere and became a lord of drugs. A fairly simple way to describe a whole movie, and that is exactly my opinion about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because a movie is about mafias / drug trafficking / criminal groups does not automatically make it into a great movie, do not forget the good storytelling.
