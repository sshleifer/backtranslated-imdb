One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. How to define "the worst?" I would rather have them tear off the two balls from my eyes and then force me to dance on them than to see this unfortunate dreck again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick runs a movie that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence. with a shoddy sham that forces her to put aside. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights to Elvis' real songs to be used in a film with a central premise that it seems that "The only good thing that Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead man" surpasses me. The worst part of this mess, and that requires a bit of work, is the shattered script: in 1958, the words and songs of Elvis that would speak in the 70s are cited! The worst special effect? That Oscar would go to the imbecile who decided that Elvis's tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognizable tomb in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold disk stuck on top and is located in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, the biggest audience in this movie would be Elvis fans. However, the rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not the credentials of the FBI ... and could go on and on) actually undermines that conventional wisdom. Ugh I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is truly a horrible, horrible movie.
