There is a word for this kind of movie, and that word is "dumb". I was dumb when it was a VHS rental, and now it's drivel in satellite reps. <br /> <br /> I may fool you, because you have 2 moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable soundtrack music. , and a beautiful landscape of Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He also has a curly-haired woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, then maybe this will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> However, he is still stupid.
