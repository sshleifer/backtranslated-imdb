My title almost sums up this pile of shit that should have given me a clue when I saw it was a Fred Olen Ray movie, but I thought, "HEY, YOU CAN BE BETTER THAN YOUR RUBBISH", I was wrong! This has to be the worst movie aimed at children. The acting was horrible, the humor did not exist, The Direction was the worst I've seen and the special effects do not seem out of place in a Disney movie of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAS BEEN PAST DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who ever had such a promising career in the 80's. The veteran of the film and former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a very bad guy and the budget was so low that it was totally amazing, even like a children's movie. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the sequel made in 1999 and I do not intend to <br /> <br /> if you want a good movie for children Watch 'HONEY I SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE KIDS / KID' OR ANY DISNEY MOVIE <br /> <br /> MY QUALIFICATION AS A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION AS A FILM FOR CHILDREN: - 3/10 BEST!
