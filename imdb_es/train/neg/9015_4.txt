The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are fully acceptable and surprisingly visible. The characters are believable and interesting. The cloning lab looks really high tech. After that, everything collapses. The characters begin to behave idiotically, and a new secondary plot is introduced from nothing on a fusion reactor (and this supposedly is "the present day") that becomes critical, the only justifying plot of which is that It requires to kill the dragon, just not. 't The end is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a movie that started so well become so bad. <br /> <br /> All the characters, except Dean Cain, are played by the Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova called "Bailey Kent" despite his strong accent (and despite it, on one occasion, inexplicably changes to * Spanish *!). <br /> <br /> Because of the decent start, I considered rating this movie with a 5, but it was really more disappointing than that, so I only give it 4.
