This film, without correction, this THING, this abysmal abomination of the fiery pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer's head. Possibly I could not find enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, trash, vomit-provoking, heartbreakingly bad, horrible, nasty, putrid stomach, there are not enough words in the English language! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, it's not important. The killer snowman runs about killing people. How can you ask if a snowman can kill someone? In insipid ways that make you want to take your eyes off, just so you do not have to put up with the styrofoam snowman anymore. In ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure more snow games. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it in plain sight! For the sake of your soul, do not look at it!
