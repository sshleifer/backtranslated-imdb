When it comes to B movies, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, it's incredibly annoying to sit with them. A lone high school student who constantly loses and is picked up by classmates and rejected by the girls, ends up walking on his trailer mother who has sex with a drunken peasant. Then he chases him in a nearby corn field and kills him. Apparently, the souls of the children were transferred to a scarecrow who then killed the thugs who tormented him as much as the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having a quick line for each of its victims, can also make twists like Matrix in the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Besides, why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Like the two unnecessary sequels that followed this, it's not even worth laughing.
