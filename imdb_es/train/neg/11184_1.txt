This is a really terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I only write this so that some people somewhere are discouraged from seeing it. If I had prevented a person from losing part of their precious life by watching this movie, I would die happy. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly boring, although as it is starring Al Pacino, they deceived me thinking that at any moment there was something interesting. It will happen. Then, the credits started to roll and I realized that I had been completely cheated by seeing this incredible emotion. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has reached a score as high as IMDb (more than 5 stars when The last time I saw the vote) Are you voting ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not watch this movie!
