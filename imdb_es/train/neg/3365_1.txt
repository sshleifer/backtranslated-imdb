This poor remake of the 1963 classic begins reasonably well, and then replaces the suspense with confusing and useless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the sounds outside their room. Nell tells Theo to release her hand because it is hurting her. Nell looks at Theo, who is several feet away, and realizes that it was not Theo who held her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives and glides on the floor. Only when she tells the invisible force that she should stop throwing it, do we realize what has happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean: "It's about family, it's always been family"? <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones proves once again that, beneath her beautiful exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however, has to explain it, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be sent to the cemetery of mindless remakes.
