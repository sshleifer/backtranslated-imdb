I was raised in a "very Christian" home since birth. I saved myself before seeing this movie and the rest of the series and I was forced to see it in a group of young people in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw him when he was about 12 years old and, literally, I had nightmares for years. I used to be awake in bed and listen to the sounds of my mother's footsteps upstairs. If I did not listen to her steps, I would sneak up the stairs to make sure she had not been abducted. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified that Jesus would forget me. This is definitely not something that I will show my children until they are much older, if they do. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
