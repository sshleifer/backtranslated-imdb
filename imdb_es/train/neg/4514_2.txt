The problem with the book "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces was the whole way of thinking of an American man. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with good music, sets and costumes, but interpreted by corral animals dressed in those costumes, so far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie is not It's not about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about some misconceptions of some American men about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So, what is this movie if it is not about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then, why turn it into an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no Puritan complexes, no connotations of sin with regard to sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. As if he was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie is that Sayuri wrinkled her nose and smiled in disgust for five seconds, as if the man trying to ride her had dropped a handful of cockroaches in her groin. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really enjoy sex in this movie? No It is said that a character is promiscuous, but all we see is that she drives away her lover because she does not seem to want to be caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geishas. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first dazzling by some old coder after her cherry was auctioned? No She lies there like a piece of cold meat on a cutting board. Of course I'm not supposed to enjoy it. And that's what I mean with this movie. Why could not they have given him something to enjoy? Why all sex has to be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha, the president was Sayuri's secret patron and, as such, was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have manipulated the auction and won it herself. Nobu did not even make an offer. Then, why did the president let the old codifier win her and, reeking of the old man's smell, put his fingers on her naked body? Would any woman really forgive a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to make sense of this. Being behind Mameha, the president incurred debts for Sayuri's geisha training. In order to recover his debts, the President had sold Sayuri to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha, the president sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old man, so that the president could earn some money with her. The president was not his boss. He was his pimp! Some romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is beautiful but it is like the beauty of a very attractive and attractive transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are exciting. But beneath that very feminine surface is a sinister secret. Under the Japanese surface of the film, which appears incorrectly, hides the sinister secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film is completely American and male. It is not the best thing to do if it is something other than a lie, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Refined and elegant simplicity. MOAG style? Peking opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha? Hair collected. MOAGA Geisha? Loose hair that surely should have been entangled in the thick paste of white makeup. <br /> <br /> Japanese scraped ice: the Japanese are quite strict with respect to seasonal observations. Shaved ice is strictly a summer treatment. MOAG shaved ice: the president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this delight during the observation season of the cherry blossoms. The thought made my whole body shudder with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha? Trainers trained and trained. MOAG geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chime - Used in the summer because when listening to the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, the Japanese feel cooler. MOAG wind bell - a bell! If a person stopped in front of someone else's house and made noises with a wind bell, they would be considered crazy, they would not enter. <br /> <br /> Japan? Emphasis on human relations, oriented to groups. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is mine" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Traditional Japanese dance? Refined elegance An almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? Martha Graham went crazy with LSD while wearing a not very auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha on a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Hahaha! Is it a strip club where they did most of their research on geishas? <br /> <br /> Fire of Japan? Starting or even letting a fire start is worse than murder because it represents such a serious threat to the community. Fires can devastate those wooden villages, towns and cities that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill so many people. MOAG house fire - Great complement of a fight scene, but it does not have any ramifications and, as it is no longer needed, the out of control fire miraculously extinguishes. Technically, the film ended here because, at the very least, Sayuri would have been excluded and joined her sister among the people who never knew anything. Which is where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall must be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough. The movie stinks.
