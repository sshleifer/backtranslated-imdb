Another movie with an interesting premise and some wonderful special effects that fall directly into the trash can. <br /> <br /> Direction and boring performances (with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield, who is much prettier as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the always serious Charlton Heston) gets the qualification of a real stinker . <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see Heston perform at his usual level and show how really bad this movie is. He even plays in a secondary plot that kept me interested just to see how it related to the main line of the movie. The way they ended up solving it was that they did not. It simply falls off the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously. Do not waste your time on this.
