I was willing to follow Cruel's intentions. He agreed with the plot and stayed true to the characters in one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my opinion, an unpleasant rehash with essentially the same storyline and no clear character choices. I honestly did not care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. It was not clear until I read in the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially because the title includes a number "2", I expected a sequel, but then I determined that it should be a complementary piece. Above all, I must say that this movie read to me, at least for me, as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed
