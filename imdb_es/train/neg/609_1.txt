This was an absolutely terrible movie. Do not be fooled by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even his great performance could not redeem the ridiculous story of this movie. This movie is a piece of American propaganda from the early nineties. The most pathetic scenes were those in which the Colombian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso seemed false, and her pseudo-love relationship with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional commotion in a movie that lacked real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining the good name of an actor like Christopher Walken. I could barely sit through it.
