Absolutely I do not see what is funny in this movie. Humor seems destined to corpses. Is slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not generate much sympathy, apart from some unimportant characters. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers think of this script? "Oooo funny, let's make an old woman high in the pot! Let's make them ... laugh! Let's do them ... behave like little children! Oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> <br /> This movie has irritated me more than all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
