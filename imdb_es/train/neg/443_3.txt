In general, an extremely disappointing image. Very, very slow until the basic story. The role of Maria Schrader in search of the secret of her family. (Does each shot seem to last forever?) There is really no rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** His mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis, by a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotyped. *** END OF SPOILERS *** The film comes and goes between New York and Berlin today and something like Berlin. When you do that, give the audience an indication of the exact time the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is, the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and the jokes about the Jews so terribly tormented, simply because of a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. Is this how the Jews left the Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answered. Was it Goebels who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an acting prize for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Should it be the Jewish theme?
