This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, without humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have done it with a zero, but that option was not allowed. I'm sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need to have money. And I keep going back to that farce of Tim Burton on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that he was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, this movie is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money." You can bet he would if he could. But that's the problem with premium services, the subscription variety.
