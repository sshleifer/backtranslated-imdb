I caught this movie on the tube one Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked it up in IMDb to see what others thought. I was not surprised by the number of silly people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked at the comments to read the Hated categories, only to find that they were none. I was surprised by this; I always look at those who hate, because they are always the ones who hate a movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow, this movie managed to get away unharmed for those who hate it and I do not agree with that, and I proudly proclaim that I hate this movie. I know I must go into detail about why I hate this movie, but doing so would only give it more respect than it deserves.
