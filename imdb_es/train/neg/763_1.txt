I love Columbo and I have seen almost all the episodes, but this is undoubtedly the worst of all. A lot of unmistakable nonsense, useless and confusing and unintelligible that wastes so much the time of the audience as the talent of a Peter Falk extremely bored looking. The 'plot', as it is, seems to have been invented as the film continues without even the slightest hint of the ingredients of the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to begin with. One part of the process that I found extremely disconcerting (or possibly annoying) was the character of Peter Falk who was introduced to the wedding guests as 'Lieutenant' Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name secret, why could not they have omitted this line altogether, since it sounds ridiculous? As I said, this is the worst and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
