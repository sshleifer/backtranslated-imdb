I really did not have high expectations and I must admit that I was not disappointed. This movie is so terrible that I felt compelled to register an account here in IMDb to warn others not to waste time. The story is terrible and you keep wondering throughout the movie "can it get worse?" Yes, it can! Somehow they manage to make it worse by every minute and you end up thinking "I want my 1 hour and 35 minutes back!". Someone has to pay for this! <br /> <br /> I encourage you to find a movie that is worse than this ... <br /> <br /> I really did not have many expectations and I must admit I was not disappointed.
