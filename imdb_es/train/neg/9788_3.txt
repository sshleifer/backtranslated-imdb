It's not that I do not like movies for children, but this was a tear with few redeeming qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly funny, but he is not given the opportunity in this movie. It is a sugar coated sugar and will hardly attract people over 7 years. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3/10
