A charming child and his mother move to a city center, cats and death soon follow. That sums it up. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a little scared by cats after watching this movie. But in all seriousness, despite the many things that are wrong with this movie, and believe me there is a lot of that, it's a very nice visual experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like the cartoons here with only their basic instincts of confidence. Fear, greed, lust of pride or anger seems to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this apparent flaw, in fact, serves to tell the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a script by Stephen King (not that he has something specific against Mr. King) are fairly well supported by some interesting work of FX, makeup and quite adequate music. The absolute jewel of this film is, without a doubt, Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, the mother of another world. <br /> <br /> King manages to take a simple story of alien people, or people who are a little different (well, a lot in this case), try to fit and twist it into a little gem of horror that It must be in the collection of any horror fanatic.
