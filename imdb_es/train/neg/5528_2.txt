With this movie only 61 minutes long and nothing so good on television, I decided to put Revolt of the Zombies on the DVD to pass the time. Even when I realized the era from which I came, I felt very disappointed. It started with the strangely optimistic quality of the opening score (what ... there is no melancholy music?) And then the opening sequences quite slow. Gee, I figured that a movie about zombies, even from the 1930s, would have SOME chills (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, certainly did) but this did not have any. Zero. It was hardly dramatic (except for the few moments with burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate someone's hypnotization). Like the equally boring King of Zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
