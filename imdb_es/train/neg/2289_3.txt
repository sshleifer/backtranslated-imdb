Sadly, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to accompany her own problems with men. As is typical in all his work, each main male character appears as weak, clumsy or crooked. To add to her fiction, she projects ideas and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page. Bettie did not leave the business because she thought it was morally wrong or that she had religious problems (although she was born again later in life, through the influence of her third husband, a minister). He left because he was more than 30 years old, his acting career had not gone anywhere and he felt he was losing his appearance. The hints of abuse and violation are not validated and denied by Bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to affirm that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been a victim of men. Harron does not point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all of her shoots (not delivered by the "sick" fetishists). Harron also fails to point out that Bunny Yeager, who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie, also made many "naughty" photos with Bettie and was not the professional photographer morally straight that appears in the film. <br /> <br /> The only salvation is that Gretchen Mol looks a lot like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other more accurate and honest films and documentaries for your life and the people around you.
