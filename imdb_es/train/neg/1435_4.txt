This film was made in the parks of Saskatchewan and Manitoba and returned the eye of the world again to the little that remains of the "Wild Western Canada". When Archie started writing his stories for the papers; The thought of the day was to tame the desert and convert / absorb the Peoples of the First Nation. <br /> <br /> The film raises and raises the question; Why does a well-educated and obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, like an English child dreams of becoming something, but understanding the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless, no matter what it may be. It sounds like a famous puppet story, right? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the "India of the cigar shop", a very wooden character and nothing real, very well done. Acting on behalf of Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality were not realized until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would take him to the forefront of the English world stage, not like himself, but Gray Owl, a Canadian native of the wild frontier. <br /> <br /> This is the closest thing to Archie becoming the noble savage prototype. <br /> <br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation as well as the Directors are well done. I've seen documentaries about Gray Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: I thought the final scenes with Archie who was going to meet with the Great Council of Chiefs was a great great moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful landscape of the Canadian lake and real locations in the "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
