Synopsis of the plot: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is killed along with his wife by his associates. Their twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, come together to avenge the murder of their parents and legitimately claim the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together, having previously done "Lionheart". This is also the first of the three films in which Van Damme plays double roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic version of the story of revenge, the only redeeming characteristic of the film is the performance of Van Damme as two very different people. the rich boy and the rough and the pure, the cigar chewing the tough guy. As it happens, Van Damme does not do a very good job in either of the two roles, although his version of Alex is slightly funny. It is disconcerting that the brothers confuse each other, with different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a very trustworthy man for the bad guys.
