I saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970s and I hated, I hated, I hated. Easily the most booooring movie I've seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh got his inspiration, but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this film, only long and long silences with people who can not express what they are (probably) feeling. If you want to see something that will lead you to drink, then this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, then put a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything else you get from this! Yes, Leigh came up with a lot of things that were worth much later in her career, but she ignores this one.
