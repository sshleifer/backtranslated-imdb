It is a bit strange that a story that is located in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of local residents is of Asian origin DO NOT INCLUDE AN ASIAN OR AFRICAN PERSON, even as an extra. That fact probably describes the Norwegian racial relations in general. - But nevertheless. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy portrays four young people living in a shared apartment in Oslo. The protagonists are two young men who can not manage their lives in a serious way, and one could say that the film could be indecisive and avoid responsibility, a kind of fear of growing up. The narrative is based on the dreams and fantasies typical of teenagers and on lifestyle models. All the clich√©. Although the story is slightly funny, the acting is good and, as a "young person", one can identify with the "crazy" situations of the characters and the complicated love relationships, I do not think the story or the characters are very credible. A polished and lacking depth. This film uses all the classic tricks of the audience to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as 'Friends' (yes, it is shown on television). <br /> <br /> Finally the Norwegian film has found its identity ?: Public complacent in the well-known American style. <br /> <br /> What about seeing Tillsammans (Together) of Lukas Moodysson?
