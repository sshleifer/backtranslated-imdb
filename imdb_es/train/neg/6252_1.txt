Ronald Reagan and a group of American soldiers in a prisoner of war camp in North Korea. They are tortured ... We learn that the communists of North Korea are bad people ... We learn that the beards of Americans grow very slowly during the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing at this movie. It was the scene when Mr. Reagan comes out telling the communists that he wants to be on his side. Then, he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, acting sober, he takes a drunken fellow, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the communist guard of North Korea is as stupid as they come. Then, the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes to get something from a drawer, which is next to a pile of empty boxes. I am sure that the boxes should contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them shake enough to reveal that they are empty. You have to laugh! I believe that "Prisoner of War" will mainly attract family and friends of those who worked on it; otherwise, it's a waste. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
