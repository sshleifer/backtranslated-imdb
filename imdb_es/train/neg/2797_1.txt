I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I LOVE horror / slasher / gore movies of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really "good" horror movies. But this movie has NOTHING to guarantee that it is being watched !! I will not spend much time talking about everything that is wrong with this. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible. The acting is horrible. FX is not even worth discussing. The "set" is an absolute joke !! The sad thing is that there could be some real potential in a couple of actors, but this vehicle did NOT leave ANYTHING to work with. <br /> <br /> Suffice to say that I saw it "for free" and I feel like I was robbed! The time you would waste seeing this would be better to floss with your cat.
