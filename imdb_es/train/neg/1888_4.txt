This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another art film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's special. It also reminds me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a group of lower class figures are residents of a camp at sea in Belgium. The same description of people who live together, side by side against their will and with all the confrontation of characters that do not coincide. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like the people who are in it either. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One might ask why they live, they all seem to be on this planet as members of a great farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: hell is in this world.
