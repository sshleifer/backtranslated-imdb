All right, the horrible performance has happened to me. I overlooked the fact that Lil Kim was firing some cannons and her arms or hands did not move, I passed the tissues, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what killed him for me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, and then Lil Kim gets up to interrupt any hostility by saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, hold on, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HOT PAST." I'm a fan of the western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone talk about a lingo like this in any of Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks that this movie deserves more than one rating, please tell me another movie. that's worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'm done.
