The animation in this reimagination of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the film induces the dream. They should have called it "Pedro y los Caracoles", because everything moves at a snail's pace. I could not even watch the movie in one session, I had to watch it 15 minutes in a row, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save 30 minutes, do not watch this movie, and you will thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the Oscar nomination committee only saw the first minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the category of best animated short film (short!), Voters will have to sit through the entire process. I already feel sorry for them, and I must predict that there is no way for this film to come close to winning.
