This movie is so bad, it's funny. In fact, Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this same movie to mock. I suggest watching it (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see the Hobgoblins if you are not prepared to stop at the first scene. Actually, I do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not fun (to say the least), and you'll have a lot more fun parodying or watching a parody of her and then watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick to see it, so save yourself. Read a book. Wash the clothes. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
