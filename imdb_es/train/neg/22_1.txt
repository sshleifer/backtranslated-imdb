I saw this DVD at my friends' house and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood, which are not very important. Interested enough, I decided to give it a try later. It was a difficult experience to believe, believe me. Then, after finally seeing the roll of credits, I thought: 'We Turks really sucks at creating Hollywood-style movies ... This is an insult to the hostage movie genre', but wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; On the contrary, it was literally shot in the United States with a director and American team! That made me think, again! - How can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? probably with money ... That made me keep thinking ... How can you raise that amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then, all my meditation was worth it and I came to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and equipment you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget, then: when writing and directing the film you are trying to produce, or vice versa, I do not have any information about it. In short, this is not a bad movie, since everyone is so eager to present it as ... It makes you think, in my case even meditate, and there are many movies that do not even give that effect ... This at least you it makes you think; It makes you wonder ... It leaves you in disbelief ... and then it makes you think again ...
