I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer / director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could bother asking. Rarely has a film been so misdirected (why on earth were random frames removed from some scenes?), It acted in a miserable way (David Arquette, paraphrasing Dorothy Parker, does not have an emotional range from A to B. a lunch) and absolutely useless. The characters behave completely out of place for no reason, except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to a completely random and meaningless ending that is supposed to "really make you think". Unfortunately, what makes you think is: "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I will never go back."
