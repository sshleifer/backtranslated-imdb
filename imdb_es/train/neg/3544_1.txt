Vulpine Massacre should have been the real title of this film. And the line on the label should have read "Guaranteed to make your children cry!" This is a drama of nature that tells the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting with the meeting and the pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. The only speech is in narrative form by a tree that rises over the lair, giving an idea of ​​the animals that he loves and lives ... A lovely landscape and a beautiful filming of the animals. It sounds good huh? Well, from there things go straight to hell and then they start drilling into the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Down - Or they can be a Warning! *** <br /> <br /> First of all, we learn that one of the foxes is born blind. But he seems to get along well enough and there is a beautifully joyful musical music that accompanies him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the brothers' adventures. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets her time on screen ... and then she dies ... And that's how a horror movie like a fox after another is killed by nature, in traps, just up and disappear, and even for a lot of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie, almost all the foxes have been massacred. Fortunately, there are no deaths on the screen. (At least not in the version we saw). Unlike saying "Tarka the Otter," the deaths in this film are almost useless and limit the sadists in the way that hopes accumulate and then die out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It's a movie of nature after all. But not for almost the entire family. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see this movie deceived by the cheerful box so that it thinks it is safe for children. Look at it with a prior knowledge that things will not go well at all and that you or your children may feel very bad depending on how sensitive you or they are. You can enjoy it. Or maybe not ...
