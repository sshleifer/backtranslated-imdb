Although the likelihood of someone focusing on THIS comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel I have to say something about it. I am not the kind of movie-goer who pays attention to the value of production, to stimulating dialogue or to brilliant acting and direction. However, I claim that this movie stinks. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean it has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, indignation, involuntary humor, etc. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite. Still, Zombie 3 is a baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many things that force you to scream on the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army man when his car breaks down to find water (this does not spoil anything, so do not worry). She enters what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not you see there was a lake in the center of the building? Yes, she is looking for water and goes through a lake. Why? Because she wants to know why people (who are not there because the place is abandoned) do not respond when she shouts: "Is there someone there?" Oh, this is just a small, insignificant piece of the big picture I'm painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, however, why I gave this movie more than 1 star. It is one of those movies in which if you forget how bad it is, as I have done several times, you will want to see it again because it is too exaggerated in all aspects. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of blood. In addition, it also has quite strange creatures: a zombie baby (with an adult-sized hand?) And a magically flying head to name only two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you try to think of the worst and most incredible movies that have been made and get to the science fiction movies of the 50s? I think Zombie 3 and similar movies should beat those. It has all the elements: scientists who argue with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting against monsters, and so on. This is plan 9 of the 80s! While I do not want to say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, expect the worst. And when you discover that expecting the worst underestimates Zombie 3, it will not be so bad. You may really like it, I'm not saying that is impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate this movie, no ... really. Oh, P.S. Rules of Killing Birds (also known as Zombie 5)! (Did I just blow my credibility?)
