I do not know what they were thinking. For them, I mean someone who has remotely connected to this disaster. I've seen movies so bad that I've seen very bad movies, and then there's this. But I will say one. Something that has written the script has been able to put on the screen what could possibly be the most insane dialogue. There is nothing good in this movie, either from a technical point of view or from any other point of view. thrown should have been fired immediately. There are some well-known names in this movie. Actually, I hesitate to use the word movie. It's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less sense. Anyway, I do not see why someone with dignity appeared in this. I got it very cheap, and they still ripped me out. Even if I had received this movie for free, I would still have been cheated. 0/10
