"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved movies of all time. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and place in such a way that very few films have done it. He had a sweetness and a goodwill that is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for its sequel, "It runs in the family." The film almost premiered a couple of times, only to be extracted at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and is, I suppose) a total failure. <br /> <br /> The scenarios and the cinematography were good, but the direction totally, the brand was lost. The film was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing and disconnected acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of the great comedians and narrators of America, forced A false repetition of the warm wit he used in ACS. He moved too much, and why he did that I'll never know. Somehow, it managed to become an annoying and exaggerated parody of itself. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in IRITF are inauthentic and forced. It is possible that the actors have seen ACS, but any ingenuity and nuance that there is in ACS must not have been registered in any of them. The performance was shamefully mocking and lacking Shepard's dry humor. <br /> <br /> ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF a sequel is insulting all the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
