This movie is really ridiculous! I saw him as an 11 year old boy, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this movie to children under 12 years old. I did not really care, but I think it answers some very good questions that children should keep in mind, like: 1) Does money buy? happiness? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things that I think would not be approved? 3) Does money buy friendships? 4) Is money all? 5) Should not I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Of course, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if parents discuss these problems with their children, perhaps they should also watch this video, to show / frighten their children and tell them that lies have the potential to harm them.
