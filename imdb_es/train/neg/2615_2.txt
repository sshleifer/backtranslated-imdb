I do not know why, but for some ill reason, I think since I started eating the Disney sequel, I decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first film that was a new version of the Disney cartoon classic, starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, seemed a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these films do not work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more attractive to children than to adults. This was not really that fun because they are adults running and trying to act as cartoons instead of just real human beings, I understand they are trying to make sure it is attractive to children, but it is ridiculous to see how these actors behave in the film. And the story of 102 Dalmations is not really that good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is shown to love animals and is a nice human being. But now her reputation is damaged like a dog, but she buys a shelter for dogs and, suddenly, she is loved by everyone and seems to have changed. But when she sees the Dalmatians of her parole officer, she goes crazy and starts seeing places, and loses it. She has returned to take revenge on the puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmation coat she has always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is an incredible actress, very underestimated, but her fight against Cruella De Vil is good, but let's face it, this movie turned the funny villain into a case of nonsense. Also, as cute as the puppies were, it only works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it is not so credible without the caricature and its personalities in the mix. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's fine, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
