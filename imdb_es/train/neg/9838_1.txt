This movie is horrible. Scenes of decent fights or not, the acting is REALLY bad, how can you say they are reading your lines on a card. With a painful line of delivery by everyone in the cast. Think watching a high school play and shrinking at the obvious lack of softness in the actor's interactions (strange pauses between lines of different characters, combined with the hasty delivery of lines by others). If the film were any action, this could be forgivable, but much of the film includes the plot and the Family Guy style, irreverent cuts (Oh, wow, they're badly done). I guess they tried to be funny with this, but it came up again when a group of high school students / college students spent the afternoon trying to create a funny Youtube video. <br /> <br /> Now to the fight scenes. They are not so bad, considering the level of quality that is seen everywhere in the movie. Nothing good either, certainly not at the same level that other posters have said (Nothing like Drunken Master). The fights have a feeling too staged, with MANY cuts at different angles with clearly different positions by those involved. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only reason to see this movie is if you were one of the friends of the boy involved in this very, very cheap production. What type can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced And watched this masterpiece from high school.
