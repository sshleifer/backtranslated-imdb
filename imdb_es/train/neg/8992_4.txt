This is a decent effort, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a bit in the dark as to what makes a zombie movie so great. No, they are not CGI errors and software companies. Actually I'm not sure if it was a software company, I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they're talking about. Anyway, what I wanted to say was: instead of wasting time cheering on some silly fool, why not throw more zombies and more action? 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, errors, some types that scream about something. And to make things worse (more boring), most deaths occur off the screen. I realize that this is too common for movies without a budget, but then there were some impressive effects (well, more or less) that made me wonder why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose to focus on how he started. the epidemic. - It's a short, no one will care anyway.
