This is a weak sequel: it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" in almost every respect and, in comparison, does not appear to be of the same genre. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different Indian ceremonies, but it seems too difficult to bottle the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, after having lost their homelands, modern life has invaded paradise and they live in abject misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler moment. This leads us to the broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and the savior who rather denies the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the former lies in the fact that the white man I learned and discovered that true civilization resides in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second movie, all this is almost nonexistent, so we end up with a weak movie. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment.
