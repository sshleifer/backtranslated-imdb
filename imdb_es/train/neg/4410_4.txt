Typical formula action movie: a good cop gets entangled in a tangle of crooked cops and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> The good result has decent performances, some fleeting moments that provoke giggles and some fair action sequences ... plus the opportunity to meet the beautiful Danielle Harris, who makes the most of her perpetual commission as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** of ****.
