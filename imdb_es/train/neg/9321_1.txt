I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and it disappointed me instantly. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch a film of Blasegadores from B movies, but I ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes. The performance was similar to seeing dry grass. I've seen better acting in a soft movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a crazy killer coming out of nowhere baffled me. How was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was, at best, ridiculous. There were no fears. It seemed that a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if it existed. If you get bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.
