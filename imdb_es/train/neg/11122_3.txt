I will say it a lot. This director is all about RAW images ... the things that most of us are not ready to face head on. The images of sex, suicide, murder and people who are "relieved" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or liberation. Although I do not think I can see this movie again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some really beautiful shots and "picture moments" in the movie (the fans, the wire fish in her hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly since we left wondering "what the hell did we do? "). <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to vomit or vomit easily ... do not watch this movie.
