What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this farce, or can I console myself with the idea that someone who did not speak English as a first language simply did not understand the point of the Charlotte Bronte classic? I do not think I can improve a comment that I read below, so paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great great book, the scriptwriter should read it at some point." It is true that the two protagonists of this film were sadly miserable. But sympathize with the actors, because the writer omitted all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun ... removed from the script. The proposal of marriage, the fortune-teller ... disappeared. The allusions, half joking, half sincerely felt, Jane as a fairy elf of old England come to rescue Rochester in her despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love of one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series (?) with Timothy Dalton.
