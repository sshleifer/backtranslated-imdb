Like some of the other people who have reviewed this movie, I was also feeling nostalgic about that ... before I had the misfortune to see her again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this film were completely unworthy of trust, and now it is revealed that The Perils of Pauline is an embarrassing exercise in the making of banal, racist and boring movies. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not overcome a stale script, a horrible thematic song and some miserable "special effects". In addition, the stereotyped representations of the African and Arab characters make visualization painful, especially considering that this occurred immediately after the Civil Rights movement. The original Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Michael Weldon reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television, but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely credible (and disconcerting) scenario.
