Veteran sleazeball player Bruno Mattei is back with this erotic thriller that clearly reflects Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei makes his film with a minuscule budget, so that it looks dark when it is released. <br /> <br /> After their daughter is kidnapped, a mother enters the dark world of clandestine pornography, because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that runs tobacco films as long as exclusive clients pay well . The search for his daughter not only leads the mother through Europe, but also to prostitution. She sleeps with some guys to get her clues. When she finally gets in touch with the snuff organization led by the mysterious doctor Hades, she herself is putting herself in great danger. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good to say about this, although it starts to be promising. The problem is that the film is by no means as bad or explicit as one would expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was released for the first time in Russia!) Is not bloody enough nor contains the amount of nudes and sex to keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not that special either, except perhaps for surprisingly different places throughout Europe. The ending is enormously disappointing. The performance is not really extraordinary, except for Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hades: he looks and acts in an extremely spooky way. You do not want to meet her like that in a dark alley (or in your room, really). <br /> <br /> In general, SNUFF TRAP is only attractive to the collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's good to see man again at the helm again: it was his first thriller since the giallo GLI OCCHI INSIDE 1994.
