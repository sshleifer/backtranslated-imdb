... well, put this in the DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never recover and discover it. <br /> <br /> Act? What's acting <br /> <br /> Production values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Do not make me start. <br /> <br /> After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see such a bad movie that I really wanted a lower rating than one. I have always found at least a reason or two to see the merit, even if only by the intention or effort of the writer, the director, the cast or the producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, we're all the same guys (!) who really need to understand the fact, at least as evidenced by this useless waste of videotape, which has no talent. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were the "production" of some high school student for his first film class, but the "artist" referred to behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage . <br /> <br /> How was this done? Who in their right mind wrote a check for this? Also, do not let the cover of the box fool you: there is not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or a good "exposure" of the piece on that cover. <br /> <br /> Two final items: there was a second when this "movie" had a redemptive value: the "talent" mentioned above is beaten by his lover. I applauded! And, I learned one thing from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is, in fact, very funny. But not in any comical way; It is sadly humorous. Very sad humoristically.
