I can not say enough about this train crash. It's one of the few movies I've been tempted to leave. For starters, it was a bad premise, first a pregnant man, but then they tried to turn it into a parody. What were all those real pregnant males cheating on? This was the worst movie I've seen in my life. If I had enough votes, I would be at the bottom of IMDB 100. If it were possible to give a zero, I would, and I would still feel that I had given it too much credit.
