I agree with the criticisms I have read here, and I have no words to define a turkey like this, but in spite of everything, I can still find a reason for movies like this to exist. Remember those happy days when video was a thriving business and many movies were made for the sole reason of filling the shelves of video stores? This movie comes from that period and I can imagine that that was the only reason why it happened and the same thing happened with many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember the imitations of "Rambo"? And so many Z-grade slashers? I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie I can say that I did not waste time watching it because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, only to find a funny scene in which a man was pushing an ax against the heads that exploded because, as well It shows, they were made of plastic. And about the end, well, it was so badly filmed that I could not understand what happened. It's the same, I had not followed the non-existent plot at all. But boy, the age of the videos was a great age despite movies like this.
