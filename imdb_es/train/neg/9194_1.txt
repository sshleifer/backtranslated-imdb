Ok, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all the Romero films and I really enjoyed the renovation of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard every critic criticize this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, the critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly good movie, I enjoyed it if it were not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shooting game with a half decent plot. This, however, is pure garbage. Terrible dialogues, half-frames and scenes of video games inserted in the film. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term lightly) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). Although his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he is in a horrible movie and that he could get the best out of it. Everyone else acts as if they were doing Shakespeare. And very badly I could add. Basically, the only reason someone should see this monstrosity is if: a) You're a big zombie and you should see every zombie movie made or b. I like to play MST3K, the home game. Watch it with friends and get ready for a lot of involuntary laughter. <br /> <br />
