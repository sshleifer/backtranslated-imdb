I read somewhere where this movie was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 black film, "Criss Cross." The last one seemed disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir", since it is nowadays and in color, two things that the purists would do that would be disqualified for the film noir status. <br /> <br /> However, the most negative was not the cinematography (it was fine) but the confusing story. Hey, some of the Dashiell Hammett stories of the 1940s were similar, but I did not care about any of them either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks in the story that seemed every three minutes. No wonder it was the continuation of this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that for the 45 minute mark, there is so much confusion that nobody cares. I know I did not.
