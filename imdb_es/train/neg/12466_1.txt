I could not wait to receive the DVD after hearing a lot about the movie. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing movies I've seen in my life. So many characters were introduced, some similar to others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film, as he barely participated, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I could have considered the quick shipment to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion I decided that the chances of improvement were slim. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie "gets together" at the last minute or so. I was glad I did not lose another hour, waiting. I gave away the DVD the next day.
