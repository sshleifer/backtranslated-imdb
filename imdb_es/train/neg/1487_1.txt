Thanks to this movie, now I can answer the question: "What is the worst movie you've seen?" <br /> <br /> I can not even think of a close second, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. Name a single element of any horror movie and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here is a typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "¡ARGGH !!!! ¡Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
