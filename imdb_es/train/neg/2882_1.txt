This movie is the largest stack of people who know what, to be and grow in Wichita Kansas; I know that 90% of the movie was Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, nothing else was correct. The movie looks like it was made with dad's portable camera. I had images that I think came from another movie along with images of a house of killing. In general, I enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but due to bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent games and a very boring and short ending. It was a struggle to see it to the end. I recommend you do not waste your money on this movie or you'll regret it. Crunch
