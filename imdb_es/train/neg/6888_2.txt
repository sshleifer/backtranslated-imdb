This film is badly conceived, badly performed and badly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying, and he can not escape the same routine as Napoleon Dynamite. Obsessed and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same mother of a man, too obsessed, who worries too much about the lives of her children (see "Because I say so"). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although in general I like her, also plays an idiot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is passable but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
