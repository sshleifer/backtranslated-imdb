During the months prior to the release of this film, he saw it announced in all kinds of print media, so I waited patiently for the video to be published to see what all the hype was about. After I finished, I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. Essentially it fails because it is a movie based on characters about non-redeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeeming quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you can not stand any of them. The film is based on its dialogue that is sophisticated, moronic and coarse. The only slightly entertaining character is Eric, whose representation of the only married member of a group of friends is in sight. The final turn, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. In total, only rent if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
