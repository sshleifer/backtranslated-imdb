Matt Cordell has come back from death for a third shift, although I'm not sure that nobody cared at this time, except for the rabid fans of MANICA COP. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now on the trail of several criminals involved in the shooting of a fellow officer whom Cordell is very fond of. I missed part of this quick, low-budget book of the early '90s, but it was nice to see Cordell ruining the body count in several gruesome ways. The problem is that, in general, the movie is quite static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. The interest fades rather quickly, even with the great master of B's ​​film, Robert Forster, like a doctor who ends up with a scrambled brain. Stay with the first film of the series, which is fun, terrifying and exciting, all at the same time.
