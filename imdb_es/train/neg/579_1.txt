Listening to the director's comment confirmed what he had suspected while watching the movie: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play when making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that cheated teenagers produce when they go through that phase of "I could write a book / script / award-winning sitcom." There is a germ of an interesting idea buried there (probably because it is a sequel to someone else's movie), but it is totally buried under a subscribed script, poorly executed and ridiculously blameless. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible, and the performances are not attractive, although, once again, I am inclined to blame the director. He does not seem to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, but he took the script in his hands, pointed the camera towards them and told them to get on with it. Who knows, with a little training, these actors could have performed better (say what you like about the musicians in the movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> <br /> As it is, the cast has no chemistry. A beautiful opportunity to use classic sex and vampirism in parallel is lost when, to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his sick co-hunter, he receives a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they should have been vaguely interested in the rest of the movie as well. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leaders, is the accidental admission of the directors themselves. Originally I intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more useless exposure of the plot, so I guess the final product could have been worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, how the movies go, this is badly planned, it's ridiculous and forgettable. Even when shoddy movies go, it's not sexy enough or bloody enough to entertain. It could have been a fun and bloody game, but the director has left with more than one comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
