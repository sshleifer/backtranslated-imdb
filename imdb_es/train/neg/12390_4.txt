After seeing a very censored version of this film on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that he was more credible and acted better than he remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other critics have also mentioned this, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Have you raped other victims before? Is he completely psychotic or an "average" sociopath? How did he expect to escape with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it just a matter of more background that are necessary? It seems almost simultaneously that he is an uncomfortably credible character, and too crazy to be able to hold a master's job that puts him in touch with young and vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the spectators in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies an uncomfortable position between pure exploitation and the treatment of the subject, without reaching one of the modes. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's not that good either.
