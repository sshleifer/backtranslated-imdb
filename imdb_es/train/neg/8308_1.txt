Entertainment Tonight has been going down the hill for the past few years, but as of the previous night (August 17, 2006) they reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an effort to try to promote their broadcast, they decided to post real photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in his teasers last night ... saying "Images of the case you've never seen before". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of his face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck, and bruises on her face. This was so horribly horrible that I could not believe it. What does this have to do with ANYTHING that relates remotely to Hollywood Entertainment? Nothing!! They have lowered their level of dignity and values ​​to a new minimum ... and it shows. This used to be THE best show to see ... and now it's garbage. <br /> <br /> I'm going to see Access Hollywood from now on.
