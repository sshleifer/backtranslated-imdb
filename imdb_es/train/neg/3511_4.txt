'I'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and I'm starting to get confused about who I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things are reeling, oh no, here comes another noisy, almost subliminal montage of meaningful but cryptic images ... "<br /> <br /> I rented this movie because the few reviews have all been favorable. Why? Cypher is a cheap film, derived, boring, set in an unusual and unreal future world, with wooden cables and a laughable ending. <br /> <br /> A strange feeling that something interesting could be about to happen makes you see a series of increasingly foolish and unconvincing events, before the filmmakers slap you with a final that combines the worst of Bond with a Duran Duran video. <br /> < It is painfully obvious that they have passed the production using Dr Who's style improvised special effects to include some good pieces (albeit a bit of Babylon 5) CGI This sub thriller, Sub Club, Philip K Dick will strive to achieve a much wider scope than that s A modest budget will allow you. <br /> <br /> The cool blue humor is accompanied by a crushing seriousness, disappointingly silly. This is not intelligent science fiction, this is the plot of a computer game.
