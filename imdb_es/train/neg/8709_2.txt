Arg. The dragging dinosaurs come back to take another bite out of our sanity in this awful third movie. This time, European terrorists (Irish, I would say) hijack an army convoy that is supposed to transport uranium. They stop at a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit when rubber dinosaurs attack terrorists, police and some Marines. Does it seem that the whole movie is (again) largely inspired by Alien (as Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? weapons in the list. This third work is probably the driest and most unpleasant film of the lot, with a single stream of blood when a rubber dino tears off the head of a sailor. Dinosaurs are rigid creatures, shuffle as usual and the T-Rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the dumbest scenes in the film is when the cops arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear a strange noise coming from another truck. When you open it, surprise! The band of rubber reptiles exploded and devoured them. Why were the dinos locked in the second truck after escaping the first? How did they get locked up since the truck door could only be closed from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene? Oh annoying, who cares? Both thumbs down for the oversized rubber Iguanas.
