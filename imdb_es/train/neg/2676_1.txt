** Possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This direct video mess combines an armed heroine, Z-grade effects, Nazis, a mummy and a host of lesbian scenes, and it's still boring; the 45-minute run time of the video just LOOKS like Eternity. The only good part is one of the false shots, in which bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist to sit in a chair, and a villain's foot almost crushes under the leg of a chair. Take this snoozer back to the video store and, instead, watch golf, bowling or televised tennis.
