I do not remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as this one. This film, about a forensic doctor who investigates the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident, has the full receipt of a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, bad mood and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a television station that stands out for offering low budget films and made for television like this one. Television movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the suspense like Great Screen movies. But, this movie sure hit all the bitter tastes. The creators of this film have lost the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great movie for television; The title offers some suspense. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. Only this movie can kill the appetite of your TV. <br /> <br /> Grade F
