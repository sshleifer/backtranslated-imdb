My God, was this the Persuasion adaptation of "Run, Lola, Run"? It was horrible. It's bad enough that the "screenwriter" (and I use the term very freely) cut and pasted the dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and to rush the story: but Anne Elliott runs from one place to another in search of Wentworth Near the end of the piece there was an abomination! Austen must be turning in her grave. No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious manner. And the actress who played Maria? The horrors It goes without saying that if the rest of Austen's remakes are so bad, they will quench a new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an impeccable version of this wonderful novel (otherwise), get the version directed by Roger Michell from 1995 starring Amanda Root (whose expressions can only speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. It's excellent
