I am a fan of the series and I have read the 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should see this are those who have already read the series and are curious about it. It's pretty bad, and it will turn you off reading them. It's not bad, but Lucy is so ugly that it detracts from the movie. Was she the daughter of the directors? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of their teeth. She had an overbite that would embarrass any beaver. The movie simply loses a lot in translation. CS books are not translated as easily as Tolkein's LOTR books, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did well! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) look foolish, Aslan was really well done, since he was not just a human actor walking. (I guess it's like the old horse suit? 2 people inside?) Also, I'd like to know what the kids think about this movie. Maybe they would enjoy it? But as for adults, surely not, even if he is a CS fan.
