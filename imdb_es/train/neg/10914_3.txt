Is not it funny that a bad temper who leads a pathetic life suddenly happens to him something outrageously magical, that he turns it around and makes him learn some valuable lessons along the way? That formula never gets old, right? It's a sure way to make a classic movie! Just look at important successes like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must have been the line of thought of Rob Schneider when he made the semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed him with The Animal. As I have traced the plot through sarcasm, let me color it further: Schneider plays a losing cop who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident, but who is saved through surgery ... by a mad veterinarian who carries him with animal parts. , which made him whinny like a horse at inappropriate times, run like a cheetah, etc. This movie is a little more enjoyable than other films starring Schneider (like another of the following films in the same plot, The Hot Chick), but he almost feels that they want the public to hate him when choosing a reality star like the Romantic protagonist (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and insert a cameo by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... it just does not exist. Sorry, nothing memorably good, except the production value. I just want to finish this review by saying that mild references to other movies in a movie may be fine, but when it comes to lines that are delivered in the same way ("You can DO IT!"), There is a word for that: "milk " In fact, here is another word: "cheap".
