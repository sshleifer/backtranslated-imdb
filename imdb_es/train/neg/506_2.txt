(also known as: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance) <br /> <br /> There are many naked girls in this scene with a couple of lesbo scenes. The movie is expected to take place in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to the castle of the island of a Count for the weekend. One by one it seems that they are losing their heads because a madman runs around. <br /> <br /> It is not very scary or bloody and the rooms seem to be lit with spotlights although the candles are lit. Imagine ... (sic) <br /> <br /> The dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by the terror actor in euros Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 of 10
