This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I've seen. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent mix. <br /> <br /> Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt frowns does not count as "direction", which this movie needed en masse. It is not that the writing was so wonderful, but that they left us with a lot of completely artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary "style" appreciated by those who do not know how to direct). <Br /> <br /> This movie gives the impression that it was made cynically to attract critics who do not know the first thing about film making (which is the majority of them). <br /> <br /> Simply terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what Victor Vargas has become there.
