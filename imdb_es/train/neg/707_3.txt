"All Saints' Day?" Where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Was the story and theme of the Feast of All Saints removed? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the remotest connection with the "Feast of All Saints." Nor is there anything in the story about "The Day of the Dead" to which the term refers. Why bother using this title if you never intend to include any kind of story or story about "The Day of the Dead" or the "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Wrongly written sequences and amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did this clunker attract such great talent? The writing is so amateurish: the characters who have known each other throughout their lives make great speeches about their life story for the sake of the audience. Not at all the way people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the Director thinking? <br /> <br /> The address is equally bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character shouts "Take my hands off me" and NOBODY is touching him! The most misdirected scene, however, is the incredibly exaggerated battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a very fake and silly battle scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live sketch! You can see extras waiting for their signals to cross the camera. Everyone plays the scene of death as fourth-grade children, exaggerating every little gasp and contraction. The blood in the victims of the battle is so excessive and sloppily applied that it seems that someone used a ketchup dispenser and only threw straight lines of red in the disguises. <br /> <br /> This battle scene appears as the parody of a corny war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to get on horseback and deliver the tick. <br /> <br /> Who in real life would behave this way? <br /> <br /> Actually, the most ridiculous approach to writing, directing and casting is the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under the corpse of her father hanging, who is terribly mutilated, and literally drips blood from his open wounds. Even a totally idiot would know he is dead! However, she is, very monotonously, repeating over and over again "Daddy, Daddy ..." while looking at someone off the screen. She delivered it with as much credibility and passion as one would expect from a child who was not an actor and who had been repeating the camera line all day. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor child had some ability to act, The scene is completely incredible. The girl will not even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage, surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she remains quietly there! The natural instincts would make the child scream and terrified, fleeing from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be horrified or laugh ...?! <br /> <br /> A particularly silly detail, which gives the scene a satire tone of the SNL, is the father hanging, with a Great hook through his mouth and cheek. It looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentionally funny details make the whole scene look fake and silly. <br /> <br /> At Fantasy La-La-Land, mothers and daughters are of the same age. <br /> <br /> Another funny detail, is that you see a central character, the mother of the girl, at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which happens more than 20 years later, it looks exactly like himself ! She is still young and beautiful, and now she is the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned off the movie right there because the direction and the writing were obviously horrible, but I tried to keep it because I wanted to see the Louisiana setup and I like all the actors. I do not know what these good actors thought when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and violence badly performed in the opening scene is strangely out of place with the narrative tone of the telenovela that follows. It is also a strange way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems to be aimed at romantic novels that read females. Strange inconsistency in tone!
