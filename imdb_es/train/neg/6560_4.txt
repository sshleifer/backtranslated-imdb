"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it too sentimental and the performance was less than average. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not believable at all. Nor did I believe that Paul's parents left and left him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the house. Their social classes were too far away to consider this credible. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene at the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was? Your son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and, in fact, it was never re-alluded. It seemed free and did not fit the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the film for me. The story about Shadrach was pleasant, but he was not convinced that the Dabneys had been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
