This film is a portrait of the semi-plastic teenager Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school due to his bad grades in Mathematics. He did not make the best experiences in life before and had serious self-esteem problems. After a difficult start at her new school, she starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some teen things with American Pieish. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you no longer like this sketch of the story, save time and look at something else. If you do, keep the following in mind: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then goes through self-pity all the time. For me, he was not that kind of "charming loser" with whom you can feel sympathy and what you can laugh at. Instead, he and his behavior really bothered me and with my own teenage years, not so far behind, I could barely stand to see them. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie just tries to be realistic and the story seems to be, but from my point of view. experience that the characters simply are not (except for Janosch, perhaps). And yes, I know that this film is based on a biography written by a 17-year-old, but having some experiences with German schools and young Germans, I do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Show sexual awakening really is something important for a movie with this theme. But I doubt that teenage boys do an "Ejaculate on the Cookie" -contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with their sperm during the massive masturbation in the forest and the loser has to eat the wet sperm cookie afterwards. Although I enjoyed it a little bit in a despicable way, it is not funny nor does it underline the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a secondary plot about Benjamin's family and his father who betrays his wife. I do not know why it is there and where to put it. It just bored me. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated this movie for having Benjamin's character, without a message, concept, scheme, whatever, and failed attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may find it sensible and moving. If you liked "The Other Sister", you will probably like this too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> The 17-year-olds should not write an autobiography and, if they do, it does not seem like the best idea to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
