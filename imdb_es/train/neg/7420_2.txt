A romance without feeling, a drama of themes without a point (or drama) ... This film is supposed to be all this and it fails in each and every one of the accounts, as if it did not try. Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter's team was not really trying. The actors are capable, they need better support. <br /> <br /> An element that does not fail is the score of George Delarue. Beautiful and moving What a pity that it is attached to this movie. In a good movie, the words and movements of the actors and the music synchronize and improve the impact. This editor stuck in the music without taking into account the dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly challenging in this respect: an insult to the talents of the main actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that works: location photography. It is worth noting a moment at the Grand Central station. I guessed beforehand what was going to happen; but the way he filmed on that stage was impressive. <br /> <br /> Some commentators in this forum have pointed out that the assimilation of Nazi criminal scientists by the United States actually took place during these years of MacCarthy's scare. By the time the movie seems to start looking seriously at American society, it becomes a conventional romance; Before any human feeling can move us, it is far away in a "thriller" (predictable) adventure. <br /> <br /> Just as the movie insults the talent of the actors, it insults the problems it pretends (and fails to take). <br /> <br /> You're warned.
