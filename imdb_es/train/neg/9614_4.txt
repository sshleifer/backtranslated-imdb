I would not recommend this unless you're interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete the set". There are some good performances (for example, Uriah Heep) and well-aimed moments (for example, the beating), but in general it pales in comparison to the 1999 BBC version, as well as previous versions. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in the story that really do not work at all, except, possibly, to make them stupid (stolen jewels are a good example). The American cast was badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is mistaken as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr. Micawber; However, it sweetens it too much and it becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines with an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews is threatening like Mr. Murdstone, but he is almost expected to wear a black cape and have David's mother tied to a railroad line (although this may be partly the fault of Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got this for free with a newspaper. It helped to spend a Sunday afternoon, but in the end I felt more disappointed than delighted
