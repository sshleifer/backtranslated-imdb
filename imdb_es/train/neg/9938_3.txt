The Marxist polemic of Jean Luc Godard is the closest thing to a film that can not be seen, as you are likely to see of an internationally respected filmmaker. Pieces of political theater, boring and endless, are interspersed with the performance of "Sympathy for the Devil", with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of developing the song, by Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, with backup voices recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it's worth renting this movie just to see the bits with the Stones. Almost half of the film is dedicated to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops, you can skip all the strange political scenes and just watch the Stones put together a song. <br /> <br /> When I had this on Laserdisc I tried bravely to look at everything, but I do not see how anyone could overcome it. Finally I gave up and just jumped a chapter towards the Stones segments.
