This is a television version of the story, the film begins as an episode of 'Xena ...', with a dialogue or a description of the little significant character. It becomes a little more substantial after a while, but all the characters are still cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Salma is exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, who wants to bust a nut in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a fairly liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, like the abbot in 'Name of the Rose', and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The dark side of Quas's character is ignored, although he spills liquid over people. Actually, he's just a stranger, since he looks different and enjoys playing bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is aimed at children, but I doubt it, considering that Frollo flogs himself to amend the desire to whip his monkey. An interpretation of the story mostly uninteresting and forgettable, but not horrible, and sometimes entertaining.
