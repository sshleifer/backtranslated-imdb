Is there nothing else on television? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV and I found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh much and I did not laugh much. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny "hood" movie, go on Friday. If you're looking for a powerful emotional movie (something this movie tries on ... guys) look something like hoop dreams or Jason's handwriting. If you are looking for a good black "booty" go see a porn movie of Dominique Simone, because the nudity in this movie is almost nonexistent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on the wire, go ahead and look at it. You will have a little fun. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
