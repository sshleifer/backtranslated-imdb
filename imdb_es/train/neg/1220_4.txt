She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also a perennial Razzie nominee. Making a movie that is so bad should be an indication that she needs money. She could make announcements about why you should not talk on a cell phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded shopping mall. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should dedicate herself to producing (Shoot 'Em Up) as she is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> It is approached by four thugs in the mall parking lot, and the first thing they do is tell them they have a gun. What she does? She starts to push and curse them like she knows martial arts or something. She manages to escape, but gets lost in the forest after crashing. Why did not he run to someone's house? We got four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox. Of course, your weapons are no match for your key. Say ah! Of course, she also has an iron tire and a screwdriver. Those poor thugs. <br /> <br /> Now, she's home for Christmas, and she brought a gun!
