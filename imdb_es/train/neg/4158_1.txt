This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this one. <br /> <br /> AND I BUT EVER EVER !!!! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror movies "B". As you can imagine ... I have been exposed to some of the worst that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I was attracted to this movie by its title. I mean, come on ... what real fan of horror would not intrigue a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies"? Images of the "undead" fighting each other until the "undead" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "This I have to see"! <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm sorry to say ... "I wish I had not seen it" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very deceiving to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no plot! If you asked me what this movie is about, I can honestly tell you that I have no idea! <br /> <br /> There was no argument !! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie does not make any sense at all! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money in this project because they surely do not make commercial sense !!!
