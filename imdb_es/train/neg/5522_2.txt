I've been looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first I was inclined to overlook more important issues, since the film does not reach a level that deserves comment. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped, confused about how to describe those things and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "What can you say about a movie like this?" Trash? No, it's not garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? No, they are not greenhouse gases, greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I hit "Not even badly", a reworking of the phrase "Not even bad" that is sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is irremediably flawed and that is not even worthy to be corrected. That's all then, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
