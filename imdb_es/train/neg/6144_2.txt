Ironically, although he can make the "divisions", Thomas is completely rigid as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is recorded in my memory as one of the most unpleasant and incompetent films I've ever seen. As such, I really like it a lot. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason this takes more than one star is that Thomas has a great shape, and it's fun to see his small, muscular body performing various gymnastics feats in the rocks and poles of strange shapes scattered over the side of the Eastern European country (including the famous "doorknob knob" in the form of a bushing in the middle of a town square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of several crazy villagers). But let the poor kid open his mouth and try to make an emoticon, and any illusion that he could have a career in the cinema is immediately shattered. <br /> <br /> At least Thomas had the excuse that he was not really an actor. Everyone else in the film: actors, directors, editors, photographers, etc. They are at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt does not go as badly as you can think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If someone asks you to act again in a martial arts movie, I bet Thomas kicks him in the face.
