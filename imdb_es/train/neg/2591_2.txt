For starters, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Even though "the naked mile" and this are the two worst, this seems to be the fall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie Movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of bad things to say about this movie. In the first place, history has a very obsolete "arch" structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the promises of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which is exactly 25 minutes long. Apart from the generalized nature of the plot, there is little or no character development, which makes it a double hit of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I did not like the stereotypes in this movie. That is, show the athletes as extremely cool guys, who only think about sex, and explicitly show geeks as inferior. In addition, it shows women only as sexual objects, and men only want to treat women as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the performance was also bad. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, a generally horrible movie, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from the point of view of a teenager, I think it's better, but this movie has a rating of 18+ in most countries, so minors should not see it.
