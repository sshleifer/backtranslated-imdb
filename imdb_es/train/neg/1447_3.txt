The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major films and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public liked most here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short and interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds out of The Depression. You know the other keys to the successful films of Shirley. <br /> <br /> This film did not achieve any of the previous ones, despite the presence of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard stars and a very good director in Henry Hathaway. Also, here are too many complex parts that become simply boring, and too many arguments between a grim Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you did not get the normal end of well-being that is what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie.
