While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells can be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start, since I have so many problems with this movie. I guess I'm just going to list some of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Acting ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and their teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? Not that I care much, but these are not A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies that I enjoy, but I've never considered her the best actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, his acting is shameful. As for the other two, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them remind me a lot of the ghosts in the haunted mansion walk in Disney World. And, they are almost as terrifying. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of The House Where Evil Dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this film is painfully obvious once you know the three main characters. If you could not see where this movie went after about 15 minutes, you need to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The suitable priest? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is just across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and approaches, knocks on the door and asks if you need help to eliminate evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of any positive aspect to write about. I guess I'll give you a point for the initial scene and a point for the architecture of the house. That is a sure sign of a winner? Pointing at architecture as a highlight of any movie does not say much about the real movie. You should be able to get the idea of ​​what I have already mentioned. And, I have not even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems. Be careful, this is horrible.
