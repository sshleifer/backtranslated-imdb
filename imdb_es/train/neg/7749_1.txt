This movie should never have been made. From the bad animation, to the beyond of bad acting. I'm not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "Okay, it looks good! Let's do it!" I was amazed at how horrible this movie was. At one point, which could very well have been the WORST point, a computer generated by Saber Tooth of gold falls from the ceiling and stabs the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth who died within minutes of his first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before being burned and shot. Then there is a random one waiting for victims in the jungle ... which scares me for one reason only. Will there be a second part? God, for the sake of humans everywhere, I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure garbage. From the power point, skip the credits until the end of the slide presentation.
