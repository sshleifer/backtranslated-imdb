I had no expectations other than being entertained for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what it was. <br /> <br /> Of course it's campy, of course, some of the dialogues were not perfect, of course "The special effects" were a bit silly. That's exactly why I enjoyed the movie so much. It's a perfect fit for this genre of a horror classic of the 70s. <br /> <br /> The talent needs to start somewhere, that goes for the actors and the team, and what better material to improve their skills in which this. <br /> <br /> For my part, I expect another film from these producers and directors.
