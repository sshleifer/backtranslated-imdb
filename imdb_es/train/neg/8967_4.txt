Follow the same path as most sequels. The first one was great. The second was average and this, full of bad acting and a bit of stupid dialogue, as well as a lot of suspension of disbelief, this movie was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I just could not stand that Henry Wrinkler - as head with that stupid eye, there was a lot more they could have done with this. I liked the first one very much. I wish they had gone down those lines more, instead of what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were too many unexplainable things that had to be explained, in what period of time he was and why, why? An old phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another one in the works. <br /> <br /> Blah!
