I've been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good and bad horror movies, but this is without a doubt, the DUMBEST movie I've seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just an idiot. Also, it was all gore. I can stand a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stabbed in the back and drowns with his intestines. Stupid! Another problem with this movie is that it is boring and probably the slowest film ever made. The ending is simply silly. But, again, it goes with the rest! In the end, when the girl moves away from the cannibal / ancestor, she receives help from an old woman. The old woman is making tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! He became a cannibal! Delayed movie.
