This was just horrible, the plot was fine, but the rest was bad. I mean, we're going in a puppet and they even tried to make the digital movie, and that made it even worse! Normally, I would like a low budget movie, but this was just a waste of time and it almost made me want to return the set that appeared. I have about ten low budget movies with about 6-8 movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie of all. Also, the wording is disabled and they use fake plastic machetes that do not even seem to be real, they could have used one that looked a bit like real one, so save time and money and do not see this. Horrible movie
