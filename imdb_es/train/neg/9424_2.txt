This was not nice to see. Frank puts all his dreams in the background and gets a normal job (boring!) Just so that his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides he will make a humiliating documentary about the man. A documentalist must point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with subtitles. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank look silly and pathetic, instead, he appears as the most human of the 3 people that appear. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a smear campaign disguised as something much more intelligent and daring. really is. It left me with an intense distaste for the filmmaker.
