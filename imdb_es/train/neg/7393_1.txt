I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, he probably weighs as much as he does, though I do not have the credibility of the street to wear the curly ponytail. After having expressed my own predisposition and affection for the corpulent favorite scenario of the United States and the hero of the screen, it is with a big heart that I must declare that this is his worst movie. I'm not sure I can make a movie worse than this. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main problems with this film seem to occur in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different story. That results in a pitiful voice-over in which Steve's voice does not synchronize with the bent voice. The edition is pisspoor and, in general, it begins badly, it gets even worse, and in the end you will want to have seen The Da Vinci Code again. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After this, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to their CDs. Is it time for me to start reviewing some of the Van Damme records directly to DVD? If you are tempted to watch this movie, take out the eyeballs and toss them down the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
