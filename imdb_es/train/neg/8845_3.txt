I observed this without knowing almost anything about it, apart from the brief description I read here. After watching it, I was originally going to say that the director looks promising but seems a little amateur, then I looked at the other things he has done to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. Somehow, the brand was lost in both films and it was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was also pretty horrible, could someone fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some images that I enjoyed almost at the end, but in general this movie is pretty terrible.
