What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with the title sequence, but that's the best there is. <br /> <br /> The movie is something about rats that turn into monsters and leave in a wave of murders. The acting is not so bad, but the script does not make sense and the film is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some group has prepared this bag of garbage and thoughts. It would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's garbage, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it. One of every ten.
