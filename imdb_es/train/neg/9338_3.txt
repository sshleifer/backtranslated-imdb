Pam Grier plays Coffy. She's a nurse looking for revenge, drug dealers who hooked her sister with bad heroin. As with any Blaxploitation movie from the 70s, you can expect to see racist bad guys get their just desserts. <br /> <br /> There were dozens of these movies made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to the black and white audience alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and the degrading and stereotyped characters. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy and other films of this type include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudes and beautiful women driven mad by sex. Not to mention the urban ghettos populated by drug traffickers, pimps, mobsters and other criminal scales. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of the Blaxploitation heroines of the 70s. She was magnificent, being as hard as nails and magnificent. As in her other films, Pam eclipses the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that this type of film is incomparable, without her being the protagonist. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you'd better watch her other films, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have a much less empty sleaze than Coffy. The character of Pam in Coffy, is degraded too much to catch the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films do not crouch as much as to get revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say, just look at Coffy, if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes seeing Coffy bearable.
