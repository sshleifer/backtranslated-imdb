This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the whole hour and a half, I kept waiting for him to improve and he never did. He moved slowly, the plot jumped, was not scary or interesting, and really never amounted to anything. The credits during the introduction were long and long, which were basically like the rest of the movie (long and long). Many parts of the plot did not make sense. Several times, during the film, I thought maybe I had "disappeared" due to the incongruity of the plot, however, my partner had the same problem and he assured me that I did not "get away" from the boredom, but in fact it was the movie . . Actually, I've never posted here about a movie before and I've been actively looking for films in IMDb for many years. So, the fact that I actually take the time to write something should say a lot about how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
