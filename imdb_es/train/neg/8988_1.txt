So far, the worst movie I had seen was Ben & Arthur. You should check the reviews of that movie instead. The review statistics of this film have been positive through an implacable and unscrupulous push by the people involved in the realization of the same, evidence that is quite easy to discover online. At least the people who made Ben and Arthur were honorable enough to let him lean on his own trembling legs, instead of promoting him unscrupulously for fools like me to buy him. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music ... what else is in a movie? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it gets. If it were not so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. I kept seeing him thinking that he must improve, because he had not yet discovered that any of the positive reviews is reliable. <br /> <br /> It does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean that a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a low budget masterpiece is the incredible Mala Noche by Gus Van Sant, but there are many others. The Secrets of the Direct Line (Director's Cut or original) are bad not because the people who created it did not have money, but because they had gigantic egos and had no talent at all, except self-promotion.
