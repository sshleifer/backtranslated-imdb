This film may have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and she also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as are the other members. This movie is really trying to make a point, saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Fair of the comedy, the cinema in the rough.
