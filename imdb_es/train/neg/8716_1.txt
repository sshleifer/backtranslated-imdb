I do not know where to start; The acting, the special effects and the writing are as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff reached a point where they said: "Our work is done, it is time for its launch". I'm glad that the first two of the series never came to the UK. In fact, I would recommend watching this movie just so you can appreciate how well most movies are made. <br /> <br /> I do not know how other IMDb users might find it frightening when "frightening" dinosaurs teeter on Descending corridors with rubber arms waving around.
