I should never have started this movie, and I stopped seeing it after 3/4. I missed the final really failed. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been much better. He had a nice atmosphere, a cast and a first-class director, good locations. But a plot baaaaaad, a bad script. I paid attention to the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh, it was better than the script. The plot was stupid, directed by characters who acted unreal and improbable. Nobody behaves like that outside the Hollywood scripts.
