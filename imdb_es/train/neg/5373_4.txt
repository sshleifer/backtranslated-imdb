This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack much higher than the dialogue? What's the point? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there it is again. BACKGROUND The noise that could be happening a block from the city behind the actors stifles the dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film it was even more annoying because, in the English version, the woman constantly murmurs. I expected Jean Reno to say: "Excuse me, I would speak or I would take the marbles out of my mouth". If you see it on DVD and you even have a high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 because Reno was very good in Le√≥n. People were delirious about the landscape, but I saw it on a television and lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
