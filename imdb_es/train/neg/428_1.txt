Wow, a film about New York politics apparently written by someone who has never set foot in New York. You know there is a problem when, in a moment, you expect the credits to be routed and the movie continues for another half hour. The characters are boring, the accent of John Cusack is laughable and the plot wobbles between boring and laughable. A horrible movie
