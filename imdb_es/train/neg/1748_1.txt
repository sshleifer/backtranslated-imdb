Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total blow in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was a waste of performance from some of the very good actors. The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, did a pretty bad job. Juan Abraham, what's wrong? Is that what you call acting? I want to say that I should thank God that he has a pretty face, otherwise I would be winning the Razzie awards in India if there were such awards in Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but he exceeds himself as much as before. <br /> <br /> The script that did not mention a 1965 Boeing Boeing scam was pretty badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood simply can not do something original. On top of that, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so exaggerated that it was painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he is not in a position to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is incredibly horrible. I can go ahead with this issue, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be embarrassing when making a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people seem to like this movie. What is wrong with you? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year? However, most of the films are unknown abroad, due to films like this one. I am an Indian and I am completely shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of threshing. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were incredible. They are world-class films that are eternal ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst in this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10.
