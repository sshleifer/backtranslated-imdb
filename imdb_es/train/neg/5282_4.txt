I have to confess that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete with the 1995 version. The reason I saw it was that I was not entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that is the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is the least Austen-like possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath in this way. It was not in his character and it simply was not made by a lady of those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at totally inappropriate times, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book will be missing or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is rushed. Very little care was taken in presenting the characters, showing their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they have destroyed the final scenes in this way? A disaster ! And, by far, it was not as beautifully photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, then do not waste time with this.
