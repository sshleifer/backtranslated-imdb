I'll just be vague about my possible comments that spoil. There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that, in essence, is pre-spoiled. <br /> <br /> This movie derives some ideas from a southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I guess maybe TKOM got their ideas from some source ... in any case, after you see this, you'll say, "Oh, yeah, that's a scam." <br /> <br /> I think the truth The interesting thing about these McMovies is that once you have identified an element of the plot, it is to find out if they will keep the original or try to twist it. There are not many twists in this.
