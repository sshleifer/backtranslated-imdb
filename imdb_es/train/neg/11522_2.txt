First of all, the character of the title is not even the main character of the film. He is the companion of the cult leader. The actor who plays Igor believed that screaming loudly, laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while bothering his eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of screaming (because he never actually spoke) with a high-pitched voice. I would also say idiots of a single line. For example, when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz, Igor sees this and shouts: "Paul! No, Paul! Why did you do it? I could have cleaned it! So clean!" In another scene, Igor tells a victim that he would have to "get his own tools for surgery because at this time, it was his time to operate." Apart from the bad performance, the ending did not make sense because while the story accumulates the little steam that has towards the climax, which is Igor, who receives a crossbow arrow in the head and the rest of his crazy friends who are killed, it appears again two more times to kill the remaining 'good' ones. The film does not offer an explanation of this, it only tells the viewer that Igor escaped from the psychiatric hospital. What??? The bottom line is that you do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could recover the moments that I lost seeing this.
