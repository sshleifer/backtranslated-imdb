The December holiday specials, like the original Frosty, must be richly produced with quality music and a healthy, but joyful story. They must have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and should have an appropriate and appropriate December holiday subtext. <br /> <br /> Then, when I saw Legend of Frosty the Snowman on the TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) to cheer up by telling them the story of the original Frosty and they told me passionately how much I enjoyed it when was child. When my wife and children cuddled on the couch to watch the movie, expectations were high, but in 10 minutes my children yawned and my wife and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes, my children were really asking to go to bed; I suppose they were fed up with the insensitive language and the disconnected and meaningless segments. I was really embarrassed by your (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents that came across a worse-than-normal SpongeBob episode than a classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... those shows are fine and I like them as much as the next guy, but when I see Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, out of color, zero subtext, mind numb episodes) are always satisfied . <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and spent the rest of the afternoon reading together. A much better option than the shamefully bad Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
