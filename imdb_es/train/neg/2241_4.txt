I remember having enjoyed this a few years ago but going back to that, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good and the girls are doing pretty well, but men prefer to let go. Why, oh, why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men with beautiful girls? What's more, this is quite predictable as a sexual farce similar to that of Confessions, but about a third of the way (as we begin to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai), the film asks us to start taking it . seriously. Not only that, but the sequences of the club of central rock and cannabis are very forced and only seem forced. In short, this is not as innocently foolish or as intelligently serious as his intention seems to be. Richard O'Sullivan perhaps, as such a central figure, could have helped, but I consider this one of his worst performances. It's only worth it for the ladies.
