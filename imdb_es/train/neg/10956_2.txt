I bought this movie in the basket of the Gamestop movie with a discount and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is delayed and are used as ten different monkeys throughout the film that almost do not look alike. Not to mention that they wear a double that's just a low-cost guy in a desperate attempt to pass himself off as a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director probably committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after the film's debut. in a preview of some other low-income Warner Bros. movie and ended up owing money to the studio. It does not help that he was not even famous for the terrible work he did, he was not even known for producing a pop-chute movie. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made?
