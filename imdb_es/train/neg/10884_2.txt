In fact, these young people were so unpleasant that he could not wait for them to kill them all, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), since he considered her the most annoying of the group. <br /> <br /> But I knew it was going to be a disaster from the first few minutes when Christine opened fire on the priest and the nuns with the music of Leslie Gore playing in the background. I had nowhere to go but down. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked false and the "blood" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, although it later took on a red appearance to match the stupid Halloween makeup that everyone was wearing. I'm sure that all the GOTH imbeciles out there will appreciate this bullsh-t as it will attract that group. I'm sure he did not attract me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid horror movie from herself. However, she still looks hot. I'm glad that she takes care of herself since we do not see her too much at present. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a step forward of the meandering HORROR (2002) of Dante Tomaselli in that it has a somewhat coherent plot, so I will give it a lot. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also make it up. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in a movie that would otherwise be foolish. <br /> <br /> The Lion's Gate films must have been desperate when they chose this one. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
