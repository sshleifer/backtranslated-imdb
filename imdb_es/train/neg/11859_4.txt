Well, you'd better plan to sit down with this amateur movie, bland and pokey about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a little more in common with her adult or teenage daughter than she'd like. Set in Tunisia, the mother walks around the apartment, gets nervous and decides, although unwillingly (she can not help it) to put on the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter is taking dance classes. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This movie is so full of filler. I watched the DVD on x2 and read the subtitles, moving quickly through much of the more ordinary dances and the incredible walks (they walk everywhere) and more walks and just wandering to the x4 just to get bored, without incidents, low budget movie that somehow got some pretty good critical applause. Go figure. (DO-)
