First, let me tell you that I am a great admirer of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to see this, his debut role. There is no argument that his talent is evident and his performance excellent. I suppose I can also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that's where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway through, I found myself thinking: "How much longer do we have to see a bore? A girl from the store, idling around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?" It seemed to last forever! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies in which the director tries to calm the audience so that he relaxes before hitting her with some dynamic event. There is no such luck. The movie continues, it's a dull, boring story without incident until the end. <br /> <br /> I do not say it because I'm addicted to action. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I hope it entertains me. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressant! <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how anyone would like this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
