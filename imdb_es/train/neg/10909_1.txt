['This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the story sucks! Maybe there&#39;s a funny joke, it&#39;s stupid and boring. Throughout the short film, I was falling asleep and I was wondering when it was going to end. <br /><br /> Nobody acts as a human, and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider acting like an animal is not something he would pay to see. It seemed funny, but the end result: DO NOT WAKE UP THAT YOU ARE A PRECIOUS TIME IN SUCH RIDICULOSO AND STUPID HAIR. <br /><br /> I was wondering when it would end, although it is a short movie. At first we thought it would improve; but it gets worse. Stupid, until the end. I left the theater and I would remember that movie as extremely bad forever. <br /><br /> The writer and co-producer of this film is a writer of Simpsons TV, but this does not look like The Simpsons at all (this movie stinks !!!)']
