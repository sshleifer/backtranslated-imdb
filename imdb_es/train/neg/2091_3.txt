I remember seeing the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat on. That show was magical. It came alive I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed parts of the third year, and I saw all the episodes of the fourth year, with total fidelity, with the great hope that somehow it would turn around. Well, it was not like that. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and he captivated me. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the funny political correctness of his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of your work on the line in DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true at the beginning when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes established by the first BSG series. When they left that after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the pot. It was as if he wrote the rest of the program without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe better. Maybe it was just some initial weak episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
