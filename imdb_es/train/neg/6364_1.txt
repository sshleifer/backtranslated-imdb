Absolute garbage, worse fight scenes than a 20-year film by Van Damme or an American ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> Acting in a truly serious way, not an ability to see in the whole movie is like a cast of wooden sculptures. <Br /> <br /> Just look at how bad this movie really is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, I do not have much love for this movie since it was not born in the 80s. < br /> <br /> If you like real fights movies, check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are suitable martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> have fun and look at this today. You may see the unintentional humor to how bleak it is.
