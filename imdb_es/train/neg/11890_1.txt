From the first time I saw the cover of the film box and the extended photograph I thought that this guy, this friend of the 'Scwarz' should be 6 feet or 6 feet and 2 inches. <br /> <br /> It does not measure 5 feet tall. It's not that, it's your fault. <br /> <br /> In any classification, I turned the movie on a cool night in Tucson, on the second deck with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time my wife was having an affair and things were going for me, so I needed a good distraction. But, as bad as the movie was ... I totally enjoyed it, with a bottle of Merlot too, I must admit. <br /> <br /> In truth, I have seen this movie many times. It always makes me feel good! It's not that "it's too difficult" to be cool or that "it's so close" to reaching the mark for an action movie ... It's frantic. And then really clueless. Then frantic again. It is the best of the best when it comes to a low-speed chase scene. Wow!! I never felt more secure in my life. Warm and happy too. I was grateful that they kept the gasoline during the chase, due to a lower production in the summer months ... in any case <br /> <br /> The direction was "uninspired" the action and the necessary fight sequences to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and tight, the sound was off, the delivery did not hit you, just followed, in another way. The "locals" of the village they were in, the city rather, were "out of place" and did not seem to follow what was happening very well, they would see and even "look" at the lens of the camera. Like a deer in the headlights, only some of them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because "Columbu" I bet he has a good heart and a loving spirit for people in the United States and for his own countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta Island" is very lethargic and incredible. I still like it a lot. My now x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I am quite discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even "love". In short, I like Franco. So there it is. <br /> <br /> Like a movie that adds an addendum to this, if you like to kill a few hours with really funny videos, directly to B movies or 'bad' movies for your little collection of libraries, if you can find Take a look at 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar ... you already know the big guy from' TANGO & CASH '. "The Big Sweat", a bomb of a policeman's story without a real discovery of the plot and such a boring performance, could well be "on crutches" and at the end of "The Big Sweat" I think they ran out of money, because they had an image of the cast and they set it on fire and let it burn during the credits. -Good fun. <br /> <br /> But overall, not as good as Baretta's Island ', I gave it a' 1 'and a' horrible 'overall rating for a tremendous B movie. I'm waiting for the sequel, maybe like 'Baretta's revenge against Montazuma' (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and then gets sick with water, declares war on the water company) or 'Baretta's gunpowder war' , where he would take care of a big drug dealer in his country and genetically splice and create a super hybrid insect (insect) that would grow up and throw into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and pass it through the insect, a chemical reaction forms The coca to pure powdered sugar. Then, in another sequel, I would have to rescue the youth from excessive addiction to sugar, etc. It could get a major toothpaste company to partially support and fund the project with careful placement of the product in the function. Right?(*)
