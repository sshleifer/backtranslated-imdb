I read some positive reviews of this movie and I was surprised how terrible everything was. Located as a cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" story, this film can not always make it about what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship: Simon can have anonymous (though safe) sex when he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer seem to have a sex life. When Mark dies, Simon, who has made a habit of turning off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father, tries to erase his memory and move on with being single. It's not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and frustrates his various appointments, while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel empathy towards him for him. Most of the movie. By the time he's supposed to be more understanding, it's too late to worry. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore from "Ghost", crying profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a strange change in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly, we have some unconvincing attempts at humor, as in the television show "Bewitched". But that does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, everything becomes increasingly unbearable, with amateur attempts to shake the heart. The ending, with a muscled gold-plated angel guiding Mark crying to the sky, while a farewell to Simon fired by the pain is simply stupefying, mainly because it is not intentionally funny.
