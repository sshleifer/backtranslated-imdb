Knowing how old a movie is, it must prepare the viewer for some things and, with those things in mind, perhaps the movie is more tolerable. That's when I saw Revolt of the Zombies. The great dependence on the tedious dialogue and the cheesy movements, as well as the primitiveness (or absence) of the special effects in those days, should be expected.

Below average, even with precautionary caution. Recommended only for extremely patients.
