Do not bother A bit of ham could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from Dunaway. The plot is one of those episodes of crash cars ... the vehicle bounces on another and everything changes direction again, until we're just scratching our heads wondering if there was ever a plot. Gina Phillips is really good, but it is difficult to confront a mystified Dunaway who plays Lady Macbeth, lost in the Duck Soup of Marx's Brother. Oh, the Crow ... now there is an actor. And there is a relative who only lies and lies down and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread, who is full of sadness and no work remedy. I'm one of those fools who only have to watch a movie until the end. Quoth the raven nevermore".
