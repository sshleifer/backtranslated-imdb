This movie gets a 6/10 rating from both me and 9/10. Here's why: as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where you take into account the action, the gore and the fears, this movie will bore you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you would see on the Lifetime channel, but set in a universe of terror. The history and the formula are old, retreated hundreds of times. If you are looking for some originality in the structure of the plot or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Remove the zombies and you'll have something as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, stumbling over cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the synopsis and basic idea is quite original and exaggerated. It's literally something that you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk. . . But that joke actually has a theatrical premiere. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason why it is not perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The mixture of both is mixed. I thought it was fun, but as with most comedies, it was not that fun. I made my mom and my little sister see him with me and that the jokes we made about this were more fun than the ones they wrote with a script. There were moments of total genius, but there were also moments of sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films take on this type of excessive risk and original ideas. I just can not say that it was perfect, not even close, due to the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a group of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . But if you see it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this type of movie more fun and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
