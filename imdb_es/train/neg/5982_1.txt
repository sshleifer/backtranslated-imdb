I'm very sorry to say this, but "Thunderbirds" does not even make a loud sound, no matter how much thunder. At one stage, I seriously considered the possibility of leaving the cinema, and I was left with the hopeless hope that the film could improve. I was going to disappoint, it did not improve, it got worse if that is possible. If I had gone to see the movie with the idea that it was going to be a "parody", I would still have been disappointed. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great movie franchise here, they have totally missed that opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be ashamed to have names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes, as far as I can tell, should feel embarrassed and embarrassed would not be far from the truth. I saw this movie in a pre-launch presentation, I had been waiting to see it with more enthusiasm, having grown up in the sixties with the original programs. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. One last thing I will say about the movie was that the puppets on the TV shows were a bit more wooden than the actors in the movie.
