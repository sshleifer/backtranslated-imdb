This is probably one of the worst "I want to be a low budget movie" to recognize the genre of dinosaurs. The film is so predictable that he could leave, prepare dinner, go answer the phone or whatever, and when he returns, he will know exactly what has happened. The special effects are so poor that you would have thought that the Lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that they make a dog look like a super predator. The performance is overcooked. They try hard, but there's not enough character behind them to get into the characters and the scientist ... Yeah, well, we know exactly what's going to happen with the blonde girls. Stereotypical was created for movies like this. If you want to see this movie, I suggest you not be in a mood as serious as obviously the cast and crew were. And if you really care about dinosaurs and you know everything in the world about them, do not look at it, you could break the screen, the facts are far away.
