Impossible to bargain over the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking for Sandra Locke. You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating song "Suzanne" that plays over and over throughout the movie until "The Second Coming of Suzanne" ends, you know it well, no matter what hard that you try to forget. all. <br /> <br /> Logan, Jared Martin, this armored filmmaker out of the wall wants to make the movie of the century, but he's so rude and nasty that nobody in the banking world is willing to do it. Finance your project. Planning to go on her own, Logan then sees this couple in a cafe by the sea and is fascinated with the young Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds her of someone she met in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> With Logan's assistant and all Gofer Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow getting a loan from the bank for $ 740,000.00 to fund Logan's masterpiece, starts working on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress to be interested in your movie. This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend the artist Simon, Paul Sand, but later, Simon feels so depressed and feels lonely when he takes a gun to his mouth and rips his brains out. <br /> <br /> The film also has two unrelated subplots that have to do with an autistic young woman, Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who was cured of her autism by Suzanne after everyone else, in the psychiatric hospital in which she was engaged, failed. It is not really known what Suzanne was doing in the hospital, but she seemed to be an orderly or voluntary person there; Was this supposed to show the audience that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There's also this newspaper columnist and great businessman, tycoon Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either. Go through a very difficult midlife crisis or have seen a biblical vision that changed your life forever. Sinclair had been looking for the meaning of life, as well as what it is all about throughout the film and he wanted to know why there is all this suffering in the world, like this movie he is in, and he seemed to have found the answer when the first. He put his eyes on Suzanne. Sinclair also had some sense in his head when his driver David, Mark Rasmusser, who got sick and tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, almost runs over him in a kamikaze like a walk along the Pacific coast. <br /> <The movie "The Second Coming of Suzanne" continues with a series of unrelated sequences, probably to fill in or fill in at some point by its director and film editor, and then move on to its final scene in a crucifix like the one of Christ. A hill like Logan has all the cameras moving. It turns out that the crazed Logan was carried away by his masterpiece when he tried to replicate, in the helpless and tied to Suzanne, the true crucification of Jesus Christ about 2,000 years ago. <br /> <br /> It's hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow, "The Second Coming of Suzanne" makes you go through the same kind of torture that Logan and the creators of the film submit to Suzanne. The film tries to be artistic, but that is just an excuse to cover up its plot without brain and nonexistent and, what is worse, the terrible and amateur action of everyone in it.
