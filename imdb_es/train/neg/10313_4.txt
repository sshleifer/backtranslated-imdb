This movie was hard to come by, and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in rescue without hurting anyone or thwarting the attempt. With all this interest incorporated, how could someone make a film so dazzling and loaded with comments about this real-life event? While Williams is always interesting, the writers assumed that the D.B. Cooper person was stereotypically heroic as a movie star, s what we get is a guy, without interesting details or ideas in the mind of a person bold and intelligent enough to have succeeded. Harrold practically steals the film with his sperm and pure beauty, but the real disappointment was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this movie to even exist.
