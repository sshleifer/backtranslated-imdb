Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 movies, since there is not much plot, bad acting, quite tedious and some very cheesy jokes. But. And this is a great actor, but there is a good actor, a good recurring joke and a good start. The good actor that is Tim Curry, the only good recurring joke is the spooky and strange butler with the disgusting hand that always cringey but laughs worthy things. And the good start is the Parody of Excorsista. <br /> <br /> The plot of Scary Movie 2 are the main characters of the original and a series of new characters along the way are invited to spend the night in a spooky place. old mansion, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you get bored, you can also watch it.
