Let me tell you that I kept watching this video to see Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the greatest horror movie of all time, although I thought it was pretty good. The bleeding is bad enough. The best part is seeing the naked female cast. The gore is very false and exaggerated. It has its funny parts but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in more than a hundred other videos and I've also seen two other cast members in motion pictures equal or worse. They should not be allowed to continue this madness.
