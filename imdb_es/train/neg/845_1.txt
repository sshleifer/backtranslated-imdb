It's a pity you can not vote with zero stars in IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact, I would dare to say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie thinking that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it could be good ... There's no chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine the length of a movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful', well, Primal Instinct did not even come close to that good, and before I had thought there would be nothing worse than the length of a movie 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? The worst thing is that I did not advance a little, I hoped that in the end they would reveal that everything was a kind of sick joke, that they thought it would be fun to make us see a movie so horribly bad. . <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Direction - Zero stars, Screenplay - Zero stars, Performance - Zero stars, Cinematography - Zero stars, Digital effects - Zero stars, Production design - Zero stars, Makeup - Zero stars, Cast - Zero stars, Edition - Zero stars, Trailer - Half star, Graphic design - Half star, DVD menu - Half star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to have seen bad movies just so you know what really bad movie. So, for that reason, I'm glad I saw this movie, just to have a bad movie to put at the end of my list.
