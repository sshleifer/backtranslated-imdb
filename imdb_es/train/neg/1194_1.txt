I have seen many movies in my life, but not as many as this one. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, does not have a real story, has bad actors, is not funny and much more. Is this a movie that you would like to see? I suppose not! <br /> <br /> I suppose the creators of the film were trying to be original and creative, but it seems that it was made by a 12-year-old with absolutely no cinematographic ability. The so-called funny parts are as fun as making cakes on people's faces or breaking the wind. Of course, if this is the kind of humor you like, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
