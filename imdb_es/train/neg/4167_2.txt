I was anxious to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, however, was a nap of 1 hour and a half. The premise seemed nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a business called "Mr. Fix It", where abandoned men get their help for their girlfriends to take them back. <br /> <br /> Among the problems with this The movies are the editing, script and acting. Although I found Boreanaz charming in his other roles in the film (with the exception of the "Crow" movie he did), it was disappointing. Sometimes, his character was interesting and others, flat. The cast of support reminded me of soap opera players. I realize it was not a big budget movie, but some of the scene cuts and music just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
