I saw this movie recently on DVD and I must say it did not impress me. I know it's taboo to hit independent films, but it felt devoid of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the execution fell short. I found myself thinking "well, they're just getting into that, the story will continue soon." Before I knew it, the movie was over and the story never came back. I can not say that I found the performance so impressive either. It was bad enough Not bad the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, but nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the execution time was, I guess it's two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the film was finished, I felt that I deserved some kind of recognition for the willpower I exercised so as not to stop the film and get away halfway. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was not very impressed, and finally bored with my wit. I'm not one of those guys that requires quick action and explosions in a movie, so do not start on me because that's a reason not to like me.
