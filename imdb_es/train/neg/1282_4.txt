Here is one of those movies marred by the insistence of the studio in a happy ending. The conflicts that have lasted for years are resolved in a few minutes. It would have been much more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis of an independent and assertive woman into a complacent woman of the kind she has left all her life. Brent, as always, is well above his head and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young playing a character called Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears but Gig Young, the actor! It's worth seeing, although far below what it could have been.
