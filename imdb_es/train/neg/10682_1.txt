So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I find this movie called 'End Game'. It is starring James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a political thriller taught. It's worth taking a look then. Or that's what I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End of the game has the most ridiculous plot that I have ever had the distaste to endure. Now that I am a kind of whodunnit, I can not really break it as I would like without 'ruining' it for those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions like "Why did he / they / they have done this?" And "Where the hell did they get the resources to accomplish this?" They are too plentiful after the conclusion, unintentionally, hilariously from the movie. <br /> <br /> As for acting, you know those movies where you can almost feel that an actor has realized that they have made a terrible mistake when signing up for a movie, and this is then shown on their performance? This is one of these. Accompany this with a laughable script and a seriously flawed and irritating address, and you will have the recipe for cinematic poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, this did not go to the cinema, and for the same reason you should not do it. Allow it in your living room; it is frightening
