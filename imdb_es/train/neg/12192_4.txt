I think we all started a lot of comments with "This could have been a BIG movie". An ex-convict newly emerged, an orderly suburban family his goal. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty used to put the Karo syrup. But unfortunately, somewhere in the Universal Tower, a memorandum was produced: everyone disarmed it. <br /> <br /> Nolte just talks with her eyebrows raised, Lange makes her way through the cigarettes, Lewis "Ohmagod's!" through his scenes, and Bobby D ... well, he's on another magic carpet. Affecting some kind of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chews cigars and fat laughter in random atrocities like "Problem Child". And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. Now imagine that it emits a religious rhetoric that resonates the brain in the upper volume, as if it swallowed six bibles, and here is the pamphlet of De Niro. However, what most distracts from everything, is its ADVANCE use of the "De Niro face" for which he is so fascinated. Eyes narrowed, forehead wrinkled, lips curved. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> The story apparently started off the screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte could not save De Niro time in the bighouse for several rounds. Once released, he feels that Nolte is wrong about him back then and guarantees the terror of him and his relatives. And we're supposed to give a little pass to De Niro's character because Nolte hid information that might have shortened his sentence. De Niro is one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of indescribable acts, feels that his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts abroad. Mmm-kay. <br /> <br /> He goes after Notle's closest lover (in a scene that some want to get away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, you know. What is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick's script: absolute predictability. As each of De Niro's harassments becomes more frightening, you can call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick must not be totally discredited, as he handles a few convincing moments driven by dialogue (De Niro and Lewis' sleazy exchange in an empty theater is the best scene in the movie), but for the most part it's all in excess. Scorsese's cartoon-like photographic approach becomes forced, not to mention Bernard Hermann's modified, outdated and outdated score (I kept waiting for the werewolf to appear with a genetically enlarged tarantula). <br /> <br /> So we arrived. In the comic part of the movie. Unintentionally comical, that's it. Do you know those scenes in which something graphically horrific is happening, but you can not help laughing at others? You will do it here. Nolte and Lange screamed for infidelity, the flirting with De Niro's thumb, the dressing and the kitchen paper on a certain substance that must be seen to be believed. And the insane, incessant, CONSTANT ramblings, harmful to the mind and endless in view of all the "philosophy" that he disobeyed in prison. He wanted to be killed to keep him quiet rather than to save this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow the thoughts of other critics, but here it is necessary. This really * is * the Scorsese version of Freddy Krueger. The way De Niro enjoys, speaks, stalks, endures the pain, even his phrases of a single sentence, is Freddy's classic. When being scalded by a pot of water thrown: "Are you trying to offer something hot?" Please. And that is only an example. <br /> <br /> Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 movie and want to be excited to see Balsam, Peck and Mitchum almost 30 years later (or want a serious movie that shakes your head). experience), avoid a trip to the cape.
