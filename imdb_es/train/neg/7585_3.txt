I love seeing the first films in color, do you mean that the clothes of the 40s were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. His "eccentric" outfit is actually quite attractive and yes, he has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel like they gave him his head too. He probably developed this characterization throughout many performances, and nobody told him: "If he laughs, leave him out". She makes too much nonsense by mocking when she is supposed to be surprisingly realistic. The joke of Madame Arcati is that the mediums were usually represented as faint females in long curtains. Arcati behaves like a retired director (Let's put our backs on it!). The contrast between his carefree, common way and his extravagant beliefs does not really stand out. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "stiff", "lip" and "upper". Oh, leave it! The three main characters lose their temper constantly and make risky comments (Did you make love? Yes, but very discreetly, I was in the cavalry!).
