This is a sequel to "A Christmas Story", originally titled "A Summer Story". Ralphie narrates her family's adventures during the summer when they moved to a small town of hick in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, does not occur. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its irreverent character and its honesty: everyone can relate to it. This is just stupid and not very fun at all. The latest film by Charles Grodin, no wonder! It is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is a formula, and you have to ask yourself why they were upset. <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on ... a competition with spins? Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
