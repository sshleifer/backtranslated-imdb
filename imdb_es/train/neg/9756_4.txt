Despite the title (in English), this seems to have little to do with the Demons and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philosopher's Stone and wants gold made from lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little problem with the death of people when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for his blood. Basically, he is attracted to his beloved and an alchemist in whom he works and it is more greed and madness that seems to be his problem rather than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting, just men and adults trying to break down with big sticks, and the movie at least looks good, but otherwise there is little to recommend. Little in the way of blood and nothing to be afraid of, and most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy movie, is not really any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
