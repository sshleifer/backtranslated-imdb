note to George Litman and others: the riff of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is "I do not think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why were you looking at your 'likes'?", simply because of the complete absurdity. that, and "well no!" In general, I would say that we should give credit to the MST3K team for trying to ridicule this TV movie. You can not really make fun of the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would reject it. A high school drama club could do better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend you buy a book and read 'Hamlet'.
