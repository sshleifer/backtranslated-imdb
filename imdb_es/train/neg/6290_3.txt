Summary: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deep, they love and they are sure that they are perfect for each other even though they met only a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law to be is not so happy. She fears that marriage is a threat to her comfortable work in the family business and decides to organize Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's supposed to be a sequel to a classic comedy, but it's not funny at all. It is mostly a puberal show and a youth excuse to show women with little clothes. In fact, in a way, it is almost impressive to have many that you can put there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, that is also one of the signs of a movie that can not support itself. It just is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, it has three redemption points, or actually three actors worth a better script than this one. It is the main actor, Josh Cooke, who manages to give an impression of some common sense. I know Sara Foster has more talent than making films like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is missing suspiciously are good jokes. Actually, bad jokes are also quite scarce. It's just not fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
