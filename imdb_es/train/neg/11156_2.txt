Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's go to this: this is a disgusting piece of rotten roadkill with the cow sh * t in it. It's just a horrible movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst imaginable performances and a story as weak as any gangly nerd in an 80's high school drama. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was tricked into playing the gigantic evil werewolf Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to make sure that playing Jason Voorhees is the highlight of his film career ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, former playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and, finally, She also becomes a werewolf. It's a kind of fucking police drama with the werewolf with the worst aspect of the world. But he has moments of almost rampant nudity. But that's it. Do you want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is usually an ugly-looking black blur that circulates around the screen. And when we have the privilege of really seeing a sequence of transformation, we are presented with something that resembles a video in full motion of a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. The first playstation. CG animation is really so primitive. It's only good for hardcore horror fans who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
