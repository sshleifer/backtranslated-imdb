By the time the striker started, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is laughable at best. The story line was even worse, if that is possible. <br /> <br /> The performance was rigid and the actors gave a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY amazing as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a bad movie to try to present their comebacks. <br /> <br /> The continuity was extinguished throughout the entire film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I want to recover those ninety minutes of my life. They can keep the money, but give me the time! What a waste.
