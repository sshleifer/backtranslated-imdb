The movie had some nice aspects. Maybe too many for my taste. It felt as if the writer / director was desperately trying to feel the internal conflict of ALL his characters. Not once, sometimes ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the work of television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as the pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was pale. His reactions to things felt forced, as if the director tried to vocalize the themes of the film through the expressions of his protagonist. Nor can I believe that a director can turn the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the choice of pop music over full sequences. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music does not come from any dialectical place to the movie and / or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly serious. <br /> <br /> That said, there is a breeze quality in the film that evokes the Australian warmth and local attitude with originality. Create an atmosphere of heat and sun. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and artisan charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue feels so overloaded with work. "Who knows if there is a god? Like a guy sitting up there in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was the friend who was returning home from cricket with a bouquet of flowers to declare to his wife "I am quitting smoking". <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking commercial? A TAC advertisement with some tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema at 50 minutes, it was too much.
