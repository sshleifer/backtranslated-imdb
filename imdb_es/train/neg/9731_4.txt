Others have already commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as demonstrated by starring in the same year "Exorcist III"), why did he agree to appear in this? Sure, he gives a decent demented performance, and the movie is not all bad; It is simply not very involving, uninteresting and unattractive. There are three "un-" are too many. (* 1/2)
