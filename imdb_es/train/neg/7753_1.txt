Everything about this movie is pig washing. Acting pitifully, horrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie is sinking into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a doubled weekend. Robert C. is totally lost and has no idea what is going on. The university students are the worst. There is no talent for acting, very stupid reasoning, and simply weights. The special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the land of toys: with stupid-looking weapons, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that is lined with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; Why bother inviting potential customers until everything is complete? The writers must be the first victims of the disaster along with the producers and the crew. The whole movie belongs in a septic tank fired at another planet to see. What a gem The convicts should have to watch this, so they can commit suicide.
