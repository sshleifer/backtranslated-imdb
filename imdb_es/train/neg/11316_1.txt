Caballeros was just the beginning of a series, a pilot, you could say. The plot (I really should not call it that, there was no plot) was not logical at all and there were many mistakes, like [warning, I'm summarizing the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, someone said that there were only a couple of those cyborgs (the bad ones), but after the climax, Nea discovered that there were many more. And it was said that the cyborgs were difficult to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with a single blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a kick. I was not surprised at all, when I discovered that the main star was a kick boxer. <br /> <br /> There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a lot of laughter when I saw it And talking about it with my friends. I recommend seeing it, if you need to laugh.
