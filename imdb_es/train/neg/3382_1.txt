This is one of the worst cinematographic adaptations of a musical ever made. The theatrical version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie loses its mark in almost every way. Even the casting is disconcerting. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. Yes, she finds a solution, but in the end she is a great dancer. What do brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous for looking great. Way to lose the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning around in his grave. Why did not they use their choreography? It really can not be improved.
