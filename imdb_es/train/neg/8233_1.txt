This was probably the worst movie of all, really. I could really do better, it was not even configured correctly. It's as if this movie had a budget of $ 5 and left with the change. Do not look at it I did not even get through this movie, I had to turn it off. I gave it to this 1/10 because it was so funny that the producer of this film wanted it to be a horror movie, but it really became a really bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls crashed into a car, broke a lighthouse and the owner of that car went after them. What I saw was a woman with a gun who told a group of girls to take off all their clothes, what the hell? It must be some kind of corny porn movie too.
