Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed!) Receives a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine, dead drunk) and appears as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then he decides to destroy masculine masculinity (or something like that) and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by the lustful John Huston (do not ask) and separate a happy young couple (young, handsome, handsome, Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes, the Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that could not be filmed and, of course, they tried to film it. They also hired an Englishman with a decidedly anti-American attitude and hired a group of actors with questionable "talent" (Welch, Reed) and uncomfortable old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), they threw it all together and ... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film scored an X rating on its release (it has been reduced to an R), mainly due to a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in the one that Welch tries to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattered ... the scenes jump everywhere and people say and do things that do not make sense. It's not good, but I never got bored. <br /> <br /> The acting varies enormously ... Reed is horrible ... very sad. Huston chews the landscape again and again and returns to a nauseating extreme. Welch is not as bad as Myra, but her lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do with her. West is not in the movie (a blessing) and it's really a little sick to listen to a woman of almost 80 years joking about sex. Roger Herren (whatever happened to ...) was very young, handsome and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find something to say about this ... you just look at it with disbelief. A movie that must be seen, to believe!
