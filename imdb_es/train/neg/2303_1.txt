Except that people apparently buy this garbage! As programs like "Moral Orel" have shown, even if you try to make the most extravagant and exaggerated parody of evangelism you can imagine, it would not come close to the hilarity of this program. It is difficult to say what is happening when you are seeing it. Is it a news program? A talk show? Who knows!? They begin reporting on several international news, but in apparently random points, the news is interrupted by this strange little man, looking like a troll, with a forehead bigger than his face, murmuring and laughing and, in general, being spooky. <Br /> <br /> Pat Robertson does not even seem such a bad guy at first sight. He looks like an old, senile, but harmless soldier, trapped in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has asked for a murder, who has befriended and offered no help to anyone, but TWO murderous dictators, who have illegally used donation money to run diamond mines, which has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China, and that generally implies that Caucasians (in particular Caucasian American males) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, all this would be fun, except that apparently he has a fan base large enough to keep his little program on the Air 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who do not give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must see it and hold on to every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly demonstrated how corrupt he is, people still hear him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mix of both.
