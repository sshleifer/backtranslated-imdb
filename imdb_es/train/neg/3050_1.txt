Just when I thought I was going to finish a whole year without giving a single movie the grade of "Bomba", a friend brought this house to my house last night. I was afraid the worst was knowing his reputation, and it was as frightening as I had anticipated. This is a disaster made in Mexico, dubbed into English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible games and effects, and it presents a rather frightening Santa Claus who does not operate in the North Pole, but in a cloud in outer space, and who does not have small elves who help him make his toys, but all the groups different Of the children of virtually every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick laughs heartily as he watches the monitors that show all these children working hard while singing terrible Christmas songs in a variety of languages, seems to last forever and without history. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus does not comply with the laws on child labor! <br /> <br /> Finally, we get an unpleasant and furtive red suit apprentice, who travels from hell to Earth, just to make small children mischievous and turn Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare . Watching this movie is a trivial and twisted experience, and is meant to scare little kids and shut down Santa Claus and the parties forever. Interestingly, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes it more spooky in the context of all the strange things that are happening. This easily makes my personal list of "The worst movie I've seen", but I'm sure it's nothing unique.
