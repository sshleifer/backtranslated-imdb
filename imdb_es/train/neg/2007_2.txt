The cast is fine. The script is uncomfortable at times, and it takes a while to find out what the point of the movie is. I found myself wanting to wash the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement about the war. I guess we were not supposed to notice ... we did. It's a house, you did nothing but kill forty-five minutes. The part of the shower ... huh? What was that? Literally, I have a client, "Ok, you can use our shower." Yawn. The angles are trying too much. There was a set of forests, suddenly it's gone because you can see it through, then how deep it is and the animals are dying. In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.
