This movie started very promising with the story of a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is obliged to help him. However, somewhere in between it seemed that the writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> One incredible event followed the next (Russia must be very small because everyone is bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female main character is understandable (why does she still follow him after who got off the ship? Why do not you try borrowing a mobile phone to call someone?), the secondary stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and boyfriend supposed to be funny? the story with the younger sister?). Even with all this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this is that there was great potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were also good. So this could have been a really good movie ... but it was not.
