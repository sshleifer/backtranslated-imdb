The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've seen in my life, but it's quite far on the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to make zombies after the First World War, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for their own evil ambitions. And he gets it, at least at the beginning. A love triangle complicates the story a bit. <br /> <br /> This really was a tedious movie, with a horrible performance that made it difficult to know who the zombies were and who did not. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was incredible (not the zombie part, but parts related to the "romance"). And although I'm not a student or an expert in cinematography, the camera work does not seem to help the film much either. <br /> <br /> While I've seen some movies that are worse, this is unlikely to be pleasant. no one. It's bad, and NOT in such a bad way that it's good.
