This movie abandoned by God is about three silly millionaires who gather a group of people to play a deadly game, and the winner receives a million dollars. First of all, the acting is terrible, and the movie does not make any sense at all. It's not scary in the least, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, so that star won. The film is not violent at all, but it is quite sordid and focuses mainly on women's breasts all the time. , and some of the characters are very annoying and tearful. In addition, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that you just want to throw something to the screen. Last but not least, the ending is terrible. I do not want to give it away, in case you're really strange enough to see this piece of garbage. AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not classified (but must be R) for nudity, profanity and soft Gore.
