This was not a well-done western. You have this nut circling under the hot sun in a stroller with an umbrella on top, killing people for their own reasons. You have this same person sitting in a snow cave during a snow storm, cutting off parts of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of a place shooting wolves that are not there. What is the point of this movie? Could not Bruce Dern find something better to do? This was a waste of film.
