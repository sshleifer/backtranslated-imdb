I understand that I want to make a film that is avant-garde and different. I understand that the previous critic comments that this is a misunderstood movie. My point is that as soon as this movie ended, my first comment was: "this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ... uses dad's money to make a movie that wrote, directs and pays ... obviously, very close to the film to realize that there was no development of the character or directions like the beginning, the middle and the end ... the part of the voyeur was good and tense, but What was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find some photos, screw the caregiver, go out on a very cold (not believable) night to control the noise and run over her loving caretaker ... the movie ends ... Someone educate my ignorant arss? I really want to know what the point is ... what was the vision of the directors ... why is there no development of the dead lover? Why is there no background about the caregiver? What is the point of night vision? What is the point of the lipstick in the car? Why a dead caregiver? Why tell us about an escaped / sneaking mental patient? What's wrong with the urn? Oh, and the lamp is what is supposed to mean who this house is from? Territorial? Why? Why does the caregiver feel as if it were his home? that aspect was never persecuted ... as far as William Defoe ... I rented this movie because he was in it and was known for his restless characters ... write me and tell me what I need to learn ... I am a mother in the middle of America who loves movies ... Chris ...
