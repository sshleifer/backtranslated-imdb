This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just MUST get because it looks awfully bad. And in fact, we could not take most of it. There were many rapid advances. <br /> <br /> But then we find a scene in which Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (his name somehow I forget at this time). Cripes. I've never seen a single scene in a movie so many times (I'm estimating around forty). And I have never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his loins. The last time I saw the movie was a couple of months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I write. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots ... Englund tearing off the girl's underwear, Englund riding a naked horse, and a mysterious woman who feels like the head of a snake. This is the absolute genius. You gotta see it for yourself.
