This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for Monster a-Go Go, truly infamous and anti-classic. When I was nearing the end of The Cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this movie was, in fact, even worse than the amazing 60's. The story? what is it like? These are three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot, but Rebane still manages to get the procedures closer to the incomprehensible. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Strangely I mean what the hell was that ending exactly? I guess you have to draw your own conclusions. The values ​​of production and acting are, without a doubt, a standard of pornographic film. In truth, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even that good. She is so incredibly terrible that she is convincing. Unfortunately, you can not say the same about this crap-fest as a whole, it's just a bargain in the basement.
