First seen 12/24/2009 ?? 4 of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that is not specific enough to explain how the true story happened in this incident based on the facts of a man who was unjustly imprisoned trying to get a job so that his family make Christmas happen to them. The three sons of the family then flee their home on a walk to Washington DC to recruit the then president of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This walk provides some secondary stories as his positive encounters with a vagabond and a puppeteer, which makes the story like a movie of "animals in the race" Disney and does not fit here. In the end, there are no details on how the president helped the family and this is another negative point of the film, in my opinion. The movie eventually brings tears, but it takes a long time to get to this. The movie is not supposed to have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb) but it has the obvious fades that make it look like this. so I'm not sure that your information is accurate. All in all, this is a simple movie (which could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas-like story but played softly and without much substance.
