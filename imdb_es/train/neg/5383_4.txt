I think I should start by saying that almost any work style can be entertaining in some parts. The real test is if it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave it the analog title for this review. Most of us agree, even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs, that blogs can not be compared to good novel writing for several reasons. Similarly, FEM can not be compared to a good filmmaking for several reasons, and actually I think it is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a rebuilt vlog. (Hell, even MySpace has some pimping). If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15, no, I'll go see it. FEM, although undoubtedly dirtier than the chewing gum atmosphere of the mentioned media, is so personal that it lacks an interesting story. It's like observing the mundanity of life, which I think most would agree is very boring by nature. And yet, the creators of FEM want us to applaud him, his very postmodern film about how to make a movie. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I leave without caring in the least. I'm surprised that I'm really interested in taking some time to write this review, even. It is not that FEM is frankly bad, because it is not; have a few moments when I smile or think maybe, just maybe, something of interest is about to happen. It is rather that it is simply ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent about it that it is almost an oxymoron: a passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope the creators / "actors" of the film get out of debt for their efforts. Probably need it for when one of them moves and continues with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste and nothing you want to do; otherwise, pass it on, and do not worry about having lost a great talent without discovering it. You really have not done it.
