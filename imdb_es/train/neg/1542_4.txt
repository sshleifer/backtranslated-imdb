Was this meadows the first acting role in a movie? The character, Leon, is quite funny, but soon after the sexual jokes and humor are too stupid to listen to them. Some movies can get away with sexual jokes, and base their audiences to know just when the advertising is turned on. Some movies that do this are American Pie and Scary Movie. The scary movie was stupid, and the American pie would not have worked well without the sexual jokes. The only role, besides lion, which had a bit of humor that followed was Will Ferrell. the character was really stupid and that was all, the silly humor was everything that had me watching. The movie was fine, and nothing more. I really do not understand why people who are dying to leave the program always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. The scenes last approximately 5 minutes, and if they can make a film with a 5-minute work, then what's the point of the world? Molly Shannon had a superstar, cheri o'terri had a scary movie, but she was not a main role, and she will have the elf. but that was good, but it made a silly movie, but I can not remember, and Mike Myers with Wayne's world. Why does not the crazy TV team get movie deals? I've only seen a man break through, but only in 2 movies and a TV show with Andy Dick. But that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue, be it funny or not. This movie is not good, but it had some positive humor. What a waste of film and money from people. (D D-)
