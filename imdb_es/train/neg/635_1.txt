Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, his role required no. She did not say much and she turned pale throughout the movie. The character of Luise was a slave and then she gave herself away to marry the character of Paul Muni (she did a fantastic job for her performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni has received an Oscar for his performance, because for that Luise must have obtained his Oscar. She must have been a revolutionary actress, one of the first to act methodically. This seems like something Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and a Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance was not brilliant at all times, and when she died, she did not change her expression from the previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the movie; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant performance was so subtle, I guess I did not see her.
