I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The performance was below average at best. She made a lot of money because the teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what went through the minds of many people; Maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people did not even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it took off? No, you do not because everything you see is a rich girl who falls in love with a poor child and he paints her naked (did that fool at least tell you that the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> Although I cried during a scene. The scene when they showed the water that was filling in the boat. It looked like pool water! Am I thinking that this movie made all this money and they could not even make the ocean water look real? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh the band kept playing while the boat was sinking ... Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor beat her in the "Nothing to do with reality" department.
