The past hippie of Strummer was a revelation, but in general it felt like a wake. Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were too many anecdotes of bored old friends and too many filler file images. I love The Clash and Joe for not collecting and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document left me wanting ... to relate more. The use of campfire narrators without an adequate explanation of who is telling the anecdote moves the viewer to a certain extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummer's 'radio DJ voice' did little to paste the movie. And can anyone explain all the flags that fly behind the scenes of the campfire? After the amazing "Filth And The Fury", I hoped that Temple could meet. A document by Joe Strummer deserves better.
