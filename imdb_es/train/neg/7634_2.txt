This is the kind of film that shows the shortage of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers. The director's wish to "sound American" is so obvious that he will not be fooled for a minute, unless he has not seen a serial killer movie ever since. "Peeping Tom." <br /> <br /> Two male policemen (or one and a half, more like, as you'll see), horrible murders, a plot more complicated than complex. Charles Berling has no luck with the genre (see the amazing stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a couple of years ago). The scenes with his pregnant wife, who are supposed to be a counterpart to the atmosphere of the rest of the plot, are among the worst in recorded history. Add a torrid love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus attract the large adolescent audience. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that could be a good commercial for the Costa Azul. It's really the lame's silence.
