Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in the 1950s in New Jersey, who falls in love with a cheerful blonde who happens to be Albert Einstein's niece. Although he is on the screen most of the time, Robbins cancels the inner workings of his intense person and vanishes in the background (it's easy to forget that he's even in the picture!). A romantic comedy bulked with a trick, being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a character conceived in a caricatured way). Otherwise, it is sugary and sunny, directed rather by drowsiness by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but not wit or intelligence. Meg Ryan is her usual affable person and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like that of a loving sister and her older brother. ** since ****
