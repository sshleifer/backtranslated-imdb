** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Tesis" in English) thanks to the later effort of the director Alejandro Amenabar "The Others". Based on how credibly mediocre and horrifyingly effective that film was, I assumed that his previous efforts would be of a similar quality and that he was in the mood for a good horror. Instead, I ended up with the most tedious and absurd excuse for a clumsy brain slasher movie I've seen since the German movie "Anatomie" (which reminded me a bit). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential but it is shot in the first 20 minutes. It revolves around a thesis on the subject of violence in the films of innocent and beautiful psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent, a murderer of Jessica Harper). Through some unlikely circumstances, too stupid to enter here, she ends up in possession of a "snuff" tape in which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young woman for the camera. Angela, and her terror friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are surprised but intrigued by the film and decide to get to the bottom of who is responsible. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never really give a reason why they want to find the girl's murderers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police at any of the events that take place, even when their own lives are in danger) and the mystery itself is as weak as Graham Norton in a room full of bunnies. There is only one proper 'hint' (the type of camera used by the killers is discovered) and it is a) very weak and b) eliminated in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called 'unraveling' only happens through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a MANGA of fake, transparent and totally useless red herrings that are thrown simply to eliminate runtime. <br /> <br /> Seriously, Amenabar can know his stuff about ghost stories, but clearly he has never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good assault is to have a large group of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with intelligent deductions and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving on to the final turn. In "Thesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER FORWARD * the killer's identity is guessed right by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes from the writer trying to get rid of the smell until he runs out of ideas, he throws his hand up and says "OK, you understand me, it was him after all"! As for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes, there is no such luck. You're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drags "Thesis" beyond being a simple, poorly written thriller is the way it really tries to make some ridiculous and confusing 'points' about violence in movies. I have no idea what position he is trying to take the issue, but seems determined to get me into a ton of psychobabble confused and misguided, among the rest of the nonsense, and say "Look at me! I'm a politician!". The final scenes, in which the "point" of the film is supposed to be hammered at home, are completely absurd and puerile, one can not help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when he looks at this. If he does not, he certainly should. This is a total of the 'amateur night in the slasher house'. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe that I have lost two whole hours (I felt like at least six) with this, just waiting for something to happen. The urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that's basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest that they are a kind of criminal phenomenon that ravages the world!) It's an area that can be exploited so tempting with much horror. Movies ("Videodrome" to someone?) But it is very easy to go over the line to become a child 'would not it be great if?' territory with him (that is, "My Little Eye") ... "Thesis" reaches a historical minimum for the genre 'snuff movie'. At each level, it is better to leave this dead and buried. I give him 1 out of 10, for good lighting, but that's all he's getting.
