The film begins on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood in his mouth waiting for him, from where he holds it, about two feet above him. That was so provocative, and I thought: "Here we go! A good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then he died. That was literally the only scene that captured any part of the imagination. After that, it was slow and uneventful nonsense. I was very disappointed, as my previous experience with the Sands performance was quite pleasant. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the script left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even the questionable performance of Julian Sands could not begin to save this sunken barge from a movie. <br /> <br /> Rate a 1.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
