This movie was recently released on DVD in the USA. UU And finally I had the opportunity to see this gem difficult to find. It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews were the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" in a strange way is actually linked to Lucio Fulci's infamous "ZOMBIE" franchise that started in 1979. Similarly compared to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a plot frayed and a handful of extremely bad actors who keep this 'horror' garbage barely afloat. Gore is almost non-existent (unless one is afraid of people running green moss on their faces) and dubbing in English is a point below the embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The plot this time involves some kind of covert military operation with a group of inept scientists (that is, an idiot man and his stupid side kick) who are developing a kind of chemical called "Death One" "That is supposed to re-animate the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked, I do not even remember a REASON for the investigation of "Death One". It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc on the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this festival of cinematic laughter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Death One" is experienced in a corpse (who I swear resembled Yul Brynner), and after he injects himself into his system, he sits up straight and explodes head! The sound effects are also quite funny: as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime, you can hear the sound of "crumpled paper". The toxin "Death One" is transported outside and is "kidnapped" by a group of thieves in which one gets rid of it, but becomes infected after cutting an exposed bottle. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the man becomes a zombie, but not before escaping to a cheap motel, infecting a bad-tempered doorman and murdering a maid by pushing his face against a bathroom mirror ( !). The military realize this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' all those who are unlucky enough to be inside the 'pollution zone' and go around the motel. They find the infected thief and burn their body, only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that fly over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We cut the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to the "great music" that comes out of a small and small bookshelf while we drag a trailer of dirty girls that look out the windows and show their chests. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a subplot that involves a girl and her boyfriend who drive a car and stop to inspect a group of birds that are on the road ... the same birds that were infected by the "zombie" smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the groom and the girl goes to a deserted service station to look for water. This is one of the most incredibly funny moments in the movie. She walks around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building, where she continues to ask aloud: "Hello, is there SOMEONE HERE? PLEASE, I NEED SOME WATER!" She meets a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall (!) And the other is swinging a machete. After a bit of rumbling and rolling on the floor, she escapes, but not before flying the gas station with her lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer loaded with whores and a girl is pecked. and infected. Everyone stops at the same motel where the original infection occurred, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the movie takes place. After a matter of hours (one day at the most), the same motel is now covered in dust, has vines that grow everywhere and seems to have been abandoned for years. Anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? It goes without saying that the group begins to break down when several people leave together to be trapped in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most hilarious moment refers to a man and a woman who explores a deserted village, of which the woman comments: "THIS PLACE IS A SHOT!" Then, a zombie "pushes" her from a balcony to a water infested with pirahna (?) Where her legs are torn off and she becomes a zombie in a matter of seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel that was pecked and infected HOURS before, is becoming a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are too many inconsistencies in this movie that make this movie too stupid for words. . For example, the time rate with respect to infected people who are being 'zombified' is very different. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk very slowly. Some even make kung fu movements, while others hide under piles of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even talk! The funniest moment, of course, is the infamous "zombie head in the fridge," which "rises" in the air and "attacks" a stupid man looking for food. Interestingly, his girlfriend breaks her throat on her part 'headless' (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment to me was the lack of stories involving people who are in fact killed by zombies. We never see them return as zombies, in fact, the only ones we do see as "zombified" are those who peck at the birds and the only girl whose legs are torn off. Apart from that, at least I expected the couple that was killed in the kitchen and / or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It is also surprising that these zombies only take a few 'bites' and then pass on to their next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moment was, of course, the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected lies in a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to give birth to the baby (!) And a zombie rips her face before her head is pushed against the woman's stomach, where a hand explodes and begins to tear the stomach . rest of his face outside. No time! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniac military officer, the pathetic and useless women who scream to be killed, the obvious characters who are about to die (that is, watch the man chasing a chicken!) I suppose this movie really is a comedy. There were many scenes of laughter, like the shed that is inflated with a hand grenade (obviously the scene in which the entire budget was spent) and a climactic scene in which a man shouts: "I AM TRESTALADURA ... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD!". The costumes are really bad: the same zombies reappear throughout the film, wearing the same "Asian" clothes that can be found in a Bruce Lee movie, and beware of the blue skirt of the 60 that the girl of the motel. when she and her boyfriend run into the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open as usual for apocalyptic history. A radio DJ who narrates throughout the film turns out to be a zombie and warns his listeners about the "beginning of the end" while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly the material of "DAWN OF THE DEAD" if you ask me. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie produces a lot of laughs. The gore is minimal, and the gore that is, is very unconvincing, if not imaginative. The usual mixture of black blood, thick green substance that comes out of the sores and the "zombie makeup" that consists of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" is a good choice for a good party or a night of beer and popcorn. Apart from that, terror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
