Take "Rambo," mix something with "Miami Vice," cut the budget around 80%, and you'll have something that some 10-year-olds could invent if they have a large enough patio and too much access. to "attic". The policeman and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know is as rough as they come) is recruited to retrieve an American supertank that has been stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank were hardened Sgt. The old love of O'Rourke (Jones) and McBain, Devon (Fluegel), the commanding officer and now meat for the depraved terrorists / spies / drug dealers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a shortage of action and not much sex. The joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, saving the bullets as memories. Apparently, the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor thought of giving McBain even a pretext of intelligence. Even for a budget agent, the production values ​​are low, with distant takes during the dialogue and very little movement. The main support, the tank, is foolish enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who could have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much more important role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) She has to go from being both scared to kick her butt and come back again in an instant. Jones, who has been in an incredible variety of movies, almost reaches the bottom here. Both he and Busey probably came out for some easy money and a couple of laughs. Look for the talented and future actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical and threatening part. Too boring even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but you want people to think that there is someone at home.
