A really horrible movie that left me stained by having seen the forty minutes or so I could stand. It is not the actors' fault, but the writer / director, the producers, the financiers, etc., need a very hard conversation. Maybe I think it's deep. It is not. This violation and ultra violence, unlike the Clockwork Orange central, have nothing to say about the sum of human understanding. Nor are they straw dogs, with whom I have seen in comparison. Rather, it feels like something Pete Walker could have shaken hands with, but even saying that I'm probably being a bit unfair to Pete Walker. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a powerful human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about that and male mutilation than about this pitiful effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think he's particularly misogynistic, just too cheerful in his description of certain details: the blood that runs down GA's leg after the rape. , for example. It is not a challenge or a confrontation, although I am sure that the filmmakers consider themselves very "daring", just very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is this as high as we can aim? Is that why the people involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote here the Latin phrase that translates as "Oh, the times!" Oh, the customs!) But the new IMDb spell-checker did not let me post until I deleted it.Also, I had to eliminate the square brackets. IMDb ordered.) <br /> <br /> Where is the noble aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at the British film, the gay comedies of Ealing or the Boulting brothers; The work of Carol Reed with Graham Greene in Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a film that has much more to say about evil than a thousand straight heads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation, look at "The Offense 'Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original work by John Hopkins, look at" Tunes of Glory "to see if there is anything worth doing, that has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is, unfortunately, a totally hateful waste of celluloid.
