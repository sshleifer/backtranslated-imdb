"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that deserved the MST3K treatment just like the other movie "The Creeping Terror". <br /> <br /> In it, we are in a kind of mountainous terrain full of bats. We see many things happening, such as flying and attacking bats and those things, truck chases, emergency room setbacks and much more. All this, in addition to the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" one of the best episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" made in the series! Moviewise, it's horrible. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
