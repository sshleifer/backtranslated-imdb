With his companion piece, MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so austerely with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE EXUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem. is that it does not do anything to be of interest to a comparatively adult audience, but points to TEN YEAR-OLDS, who are only able to count the bags of corpses, and just that. And so, rudeness is king, and the king is rudeness. <br /> <br /> Is Stephen King simply illiterate? in general he has the aptitude to tell stories of Bart Simpson. Since he can not read, his only inspiration is cinema. <br /> <br /> It is true that cinema is not a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of "Realism". But these movies are just the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you should go deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close as known ones. But even so, it should be clear to any student that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least the AUTOPSY FOUR ROOM is a clear indication of what is wrong. You can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting at his desk trying to find something. SCARY <br /> <br /> No, look, trying to accurately describe the horror of the system of which it is an integral part, making the stupid stupid, but trying to devise a scary story for his nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and they started opening up to you like they do in those autopsies! Would not that be disgusting? And that, boys and girls, is the story. <br /> <br /> What happens with the characterization? Oh yes, it's one of these outfits, you never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he is screaming? Well, they can not really hear it, you know? He's saying he's going to sue the hospital, but it's not that important anymore, you know, lying there (or lying down, I'll never remember) and everything. And he's thinking: Oh no, please, do not cut me and this is terrible, lie (or knock down) like that? Now, would not that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snakebite can do that, I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yes, a BOOMSLANG? It sounds pretty good, right? <br /> <br /> Let's make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that's great? Except BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, asshole! But how can you really say that the target audience is children and not just mental defects? It's easy: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it's the kind that glimpses through a crack in the door of our parents' bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really great in the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the persecution. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what is going on. All that really remains is the laughter outside the SM club and the fascist creed that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no real enthusiasm in that, first you have to torture her? not in any way that could excite her, you understand, since that would alter our Puritan feelings. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasant and the preparation of psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get an erection if someone touches him. to know ?? Rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover that he is, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspiring powers. It's too bad that they have eliminated it, since it could have bothered the FIVE YEARS of watching the show!
