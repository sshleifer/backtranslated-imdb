Five minutes after seeing this, I logged into IMDb to warn all of you not to bother with this movie ... genre: horror? I had moments of mild suspense and throughout the film I thought to myself "some must happen soon", it was not like that ... when the movie ended, I felt so embarrassed by the writer / director that I have never been Patrick's biggest fan Rea, this guy just does not know how to make movies and after seeing this apology apology from a horror movie, I've gone from not being the biggest fan to not seeing another of his works. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the plot summary, please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors ... they were not bad and it was not the fault of getting such a bad address ...
