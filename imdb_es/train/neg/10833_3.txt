I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 lives / different stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia took a wrong turn in the middle of the movie and I got lost. I almost turned it off at the time, but I felt that I should stay there until the end, little did I know it would be another tortuous hour and a half. Thank God I rented instead of seeing him in the theater. I almost cried out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the final frog scene. My DVD player has not yet forgiven me and I do not blame him a bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad movie, boring and useless.
