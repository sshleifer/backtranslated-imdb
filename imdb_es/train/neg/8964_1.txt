['Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube films know quite well what to expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of rooms with booby traps, paranoia, bad acting ... However, this one is a little different. Approximately half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we can observe the people who observe the people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /><br /> I suppose that Cube Zero aspires to explain what is the deal with the cube, but really do not know much more than what was covered in the first two films. Sure, there&#39;s some kind of explanation there, but it feels pretty boring compared to what was suggested in the first movie. <br /><br /> Cube Zero seems pretty cheap (like its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than a couple of empty rooms just emphasizes this feeling. I also felt quite confident in saying that there is no risk that any of the actors will win any prize in the foreseeable future. However, they have brought back the traps of Cube 1 (that&#39;s why I mean they are almost the same, which is a pity). <br /><br /> I know that many people appreciate this film and its links to the first, but I feel it is a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise with which it was not so good.
