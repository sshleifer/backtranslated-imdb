Wow, what a bad movie it was! I can not understand what people are so scared about "The Grudge". The director plays a trick (he would have to admit a very good one, which comes to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result, I jumped a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I learned the exercise, I practically fell asleep as The Grudge became increasingly predictable. To conclude, I can say that there are many better films in the genre to start with, that the so-called "The Ring" predecessor was much more frightening and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
