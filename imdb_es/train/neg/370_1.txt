Blank Check is easily one of the worst movies of the nineties. The plot is completely useless; Its connotations of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really think that a twelve-year-old child acting as a personal assistant to a millionaire could achieve everything in this movie, like buying a mansion for only $ 300,000 dollars? The notion, let alone the bargain price, will only be believed by the most gullible spectators. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible, horrible movie.
