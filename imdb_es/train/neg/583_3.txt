I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and I generally enjoy particularly the BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than what moved me to the novel. <br /> <br /> First, the music (and the songs) seem totally out of place in a period drama (sounds like it was written for a contemporary horror movie) and, like another commentator, It bothered especially the way the cameras rotated and revolved around the actors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in "North and South" and everything seemed fine, but in The Tenant, it's definitely exaggerated and just annoying. The movements of the camera can not make the performance of the wood more animated. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters was introduced correctly at the beginning. The boy had a very good performance, is very cute and the best movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The characterization of Tara Fitzgerald by Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, without letting any emotion go by. She does not seem to be able to cry in any realistic way. He just could not believe that Markham had fallen in love with her and did not mention the horrible hairstyle they had given him. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! I guess being married to such a virago ... Besides, he was the only main actor that I thought was right. Toby Stephens I thought it was fine, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel that deals with issues as grim as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what is only insinuated and left to the imagination of the reader in the book is based on the complacency in the television adaptation: do some thick and comical scenes (like when Huntingdon's eyes start to bleed) and others too sexed to a period of drama! I mean, do not we have enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
