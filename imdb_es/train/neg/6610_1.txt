This film should not be seen, since it was destined to be a failure. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a new version of the classic bollywood movie "Sholay", but after having problems with the original creators, decided to go ahead with the project and ... I guess I'll leave all the good parts of the film (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and filming the movie just because he has already hired the team. Loss of money, loss of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he took us a Coppola (Godfather); What were you thinking RGV? Anyway, the story is, although hard to follow, it's almost like old Sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new boy on the block playing Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends help a policeman to capture a bad man first. Later in the film, now the retired policeman hires them as personal security and to safeguard them from the hands of a most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you have not seen the Bollywood movies, the good ones win in the end. There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
