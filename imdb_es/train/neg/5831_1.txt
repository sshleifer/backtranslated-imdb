This movie is massively boring and pretentious. There's only one good time when a sailor shaves Barney's eyebrow (think it's not a purple dinosaur). Music is implacably cloying; It is sad that Bjork, someone with such inner beauty, has been subjected to a pretentious falsehood in his art. The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem insipid. Mythology and culture are not respected in this movie are raised. Not only from the Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (stay tuned) In a perfect moment of "art imitates life": the ship's crew finds a giant piece of shit. What is the audience found in the theater? There are some set pieces that are very composed and artistic without a heart; Then, prepare for the spoilers. I'm talking to you, MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you have been overcome! I have seen the SANTA MOUNTAIN of Jodorowsky. And your thin and fake BS veil has been lifted. You have stolen your images, your style and your WHOLE ART CATALOG from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY, let's hope that the powers of the Art Councils of the world STOP FINANCING! Poor Jodorowsky: lost in a financial battle with the lawyer of the Beatles when he is the Lennon / McCartney of cinematography. And by the way, while Jodorowsky is the Beatle, YOU ARE THE MONKEYS! A thin and cheap soulless scam that only college freshmen liked. And by the way I'm a filmmaker. If you are interested in making a reality movie, I will fight you legally in a ring defending Jodorowsky, you, defending absolute theft.
