Woohoo! I am surprised to know that it is a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne said it much better in a sentence. "No man is an island." The performance was not bad. The children gave everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin that they could not follow it and the only real "hero" in the movie ends up in jail after being tormented by a maid of a meter. I do not know. I just do not understand. Oh good.
