I saw this movie under the title of "Tied". In general, I enjoyed the Dolph movies, so I tried this one. It was not worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about the picture that attracts the viewers. Do not be fooled This is a bad movie at best. The performance is non-existent. The plot, the little that there is of one, is very predictable. The movie in places seems cut. This simply stinks the place. It is not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. As a little fan of Dolph, I kept waiting to see him in action. At the end of the movie, you'll still be waiting. It is best to avoid this movie, and spend your time watching almost anything else.
