Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was really good, but the overall execution was simply terrible. I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it to production. A blind guy has new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to an old and bad werewolf. Unpleasant things start to happen to the guy when he turns into a corny-looking creature. Can you find a cure before your hot girlfriend finds out? Who is that weird little troll that helps him and what's up with that cop? If you really want to find out, check out Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for a movie. He only wished that the filmmakers had spent a lot of time in preproduction before deciding to film the film.
