I tried to eliminate anything that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least you know the general essence, so if you do not have some of this, it might not make sense. <br /> <br /> Argument: this film surpasses the audience above the Head with philosophical ramblings tired again and again in an attempt to convey the theme. We are bombarded again and again for reasons of purpose, and destiny, and choice, and we are forced to endure the long and turbulent sessions of restraint that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, Now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are many revelations in this movie, about which I will be lazy so they do not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you're still worried, vague references will spoil the movie, do not do it. t read the paragraph below. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of the faith is revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and their temporal nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology, are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining more things that are revealed would go into too many details, so I will abstain (as indicated by the guidelines for writing a comment). Btw, by "revealed" I mean we hit our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Story: How is Neo and the gang going from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next? In short, they maintain the faith, and they use and abuse the too stylized action and the bullet time as if it were fashionable (and after this screen, I hope that both the filmmakers and the manufacturers will learn to appreciate a little the originality and the subtlety More). More on that later. In order not to spoil anything, I will not say more than the promotional material he has already done: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, while the bad guys are chasing him. and its cohorts. The film takes almost where was the last. <br /> <br /> Action: While the action of the martial arts and the weapons game splashed his predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this film focuses much more on the martial arts than on the weapons game, adding swords , sais, etc. To the mix. Special effects are used so often and are shaken in the face of the audience that it becomes really exhausting. I have discussed this movie with friends and co-workers alike, and almost all of them found that some of the action sequences, especially the "Smith fight" that we all heard would be in the film, were too long and tedious. This is a big red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should leave you wanting a little more, or be completely satisfied with the wonder that just happened. <br /> <br /> These fight scenes do nothing. . They are sequences on stylized, on the top that are made of wood and are not inspired. In the first film, there was a real feeling of desperation on the part of the action, the feeling that to fight was to survive, not only look good (which, honestly, I do not think they achieve in Reloaded) in black and leather. Go see Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remember what good fighting sequences are, you will not regret it. In addition, the "Matrix skills" that people have in Reloaded are not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they were not too obvious, unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are poured over and over again. Every little thing that someone does, whether it's just jumping, somersaulting, turning and, in many cases, simply posing, is slow, sporadic or over-stressed by some kind of destruction. It is evident that the W Bros had a lot of money to cast in this film, and boy, they threw it, without any real restriction. Sharp editors really could have helped this, but the first movie was such a success that obviously gave free reign, which leads us to do so. . . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already said more or less that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical places. The actors really can not bring much depth to their character when the script and direction are pushing the audience's face of the character's progress, or neglecting it completely. At no time is the audience given nuances and substances so that they can contemplate the character on their own. <br /> <br /> Keanu's performance is rigid at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that's all he does in this movie. He makes a decent attempt to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but it does not work. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything, from Moses to Henry V, and be as great as a cat at all times. With the script that is provided, makes a noble attempt, but also deflates. <br /> <br /> The moss is not very credible either. His look of concern is always the same, very similar to Keanu's, and the chemistry is not there, although in his very physical scenes they pretend it well enough. <br /> <br /> Once again Hugo gave him his strange sense of being. an agent program, but he also suffered from the hand of the script. In fact, I think he's the most interesting character in the group, but instead of developing it, they make it an excuse for a big fight scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is more than disappointing. If he had good expectations, and on his own, as an independent film (which is not the way it's supposed to be taken), it's still horrible. I do not see The Matrix so deep, but at least I see it as an entertaining science fiction game that has some interesting ideas, good action, some funny lines and enough symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. The reload fails in all these charges, and I really hope that the W Bros provide us with a better experience in the third installment. Okay, I do not have much hope for that after this movie.
