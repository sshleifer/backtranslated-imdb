The movie Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've seen in my life. I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written on it ... which means that the filmmakers will focus more on getting you off than on making you laugh. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amateur jumble of childish parodies, bad characters and worse jokes ... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketching to the painful and uninvited character of Arnold Shvollenpecker, they just are not funny. The few parodies that are a little funny are few and far between: seeing Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example, but even last a long time and are ruined by the ineptitude of Vince Offer in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the underground comedy movie underground ... Bury it!
