Blank Check is a movie that I saw on television one day and like most movies that are broadcast on TV Blank Check was not so good. First of all, nobody I have met has seen Blank Check and that includes people who grew up in the 90s. Also, Blank Check will not be remembered in the 00s, simply because it will be overshadowed by Pixar movies. I would not call Blank Check a bad movie, but it's not really entertaining either. (Or at least it is not for anyone over 6 years old) Blank Check is not an entertaining movie because nothing original is original. Everything makes you go "what is it that I have not seen before?" Blank Check breaks and tries to take advantage of everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which, surprisingly, both have Macaulay Culkin) Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to disappear in the dark.
