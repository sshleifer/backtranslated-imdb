The only reason I even saw it was because I found it in my local library (and I will reprimand them mercilessly for having wasted public funds on it), and despite the large number of tits and asses, I soon realized that The fast forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, camera work for pedestrians, sporadically bad performance to almost passable, clumsy effects and one of the worst scripts I've had the disgust of seeing come alive (as it was, horribly paralyzed and mutilated) in a very long time. The best laughs actually come from the "Making of ..." featurette, in which the poor sap involved in this HDV disaster try to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, rather than something that will not be completely forgotten next week. I waited! Except for the fact that someone somehow attracted Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all people, to do a small part, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How this happened, I'll never know, and to be honest, I really do not care. Look at your own risk and do not say you have not been warned. This is to make movies in their pretentious moment, worse. He only gets a 2 on my part for having some attractive naked women, and even then, barely.
