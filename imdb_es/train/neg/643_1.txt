I'm a big fan of the Largo Winch television series. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast forward to not fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone ruin this title so much? History was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a null. Look at the other roles of this actor. The fight scenes were incredibly boring and could not be followed, somehow they should not follow the situation. As another critic said, a low budget movie with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else can do something better with this title. The French can not do the right thing with great movies, like Alien 4. That was a bit better, after Alien 1,2,3.
