It is so sad that the Romanian public is still populated by vulgar and uneducated people who enjoy this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or the children's games "Vacanta mare" ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-artisans of this type never claim to claim their shows as "art". Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good film ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by another, which is quite good ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare her "works of art" in feature films, but, unfortunately, is a teacher. On a too limited level, specifically cinematographic means of expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample of "HOW NOT", this being his only merit.
