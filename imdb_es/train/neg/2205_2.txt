This type of plot really has great potential, but it was massacred here. Honestly, I perceived the cheese element at the beginning, but I thought it would improve after the grotesque birth. Whoa, I was wrong! So the mad scientist makes a monster, he wants to show off his old buddies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should have counted how many times the shark gum mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but most likely I would have lost count. <br /> <br /> Move to the leg that drips blood to show us how the shark finds people. I hate being spoon fed in all aspects of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after being almost killed by a mutated shark and walking through the jungle island, there's nothing happier than a half. Middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is one where you'll find yourself encouraging the monster ... if you can stand to see this poor excuse for a movie.
