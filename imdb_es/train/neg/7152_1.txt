Based on a self-service novel by a once friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this shoddy story. Gregory Peck continues with a shameless excess as an energetic alcoholic, drunk or cursed; In contradiction with the true and soft spoken of Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the time of Fitzgerald's writing in Hollywood, at the end of his life, the honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively combating his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was not so proud to be recycling his flapper stories to support his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second-hand Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different than the one shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> Practically all 20th Century-Fox films made during the leadership of Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as practically all the films directed by Henry King, were a work of excellence. Beloved infidel was the exception.
