Maya is a woman without interests. She only dreams of her life and wonders why she does not feel satisfied. This could be an interesting topic. That would need a good story, pleasant surroundings and good dialogues. It does not have any of these. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and there is no climax. The only climax is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of yours, I could not stand this movie. Even he can not make this movie come out. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you're a fan of Art-house or you like it a little, maybe you like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it does not catch. My recommendation: do not look at it.
