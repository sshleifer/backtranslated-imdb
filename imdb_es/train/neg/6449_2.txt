Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty-odd years whose characters are all unpleasant, and a man-lizard like an iguana pursues them and you have an idea of ​​stupidity here. On the positive side, the film does not skimp on showing the monster. There are no peek-a-boo shots, or night scenes in which you have to imagine what it looks like; He is out there, people. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not as inspired. A little mystery could have helped. Of course, I've seen much worse, but if you're going to have it on display for a lot of movies, it's better that your monster looks very good. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a twist ending that involves the supposedly dead brother that does not make any sense at all. This was not a surprise given the poor quality of script writing. As for the performance; Well, let's say it was not very painful, but I do not think we'll see many of these children in future cinematic outings. <br /> <br /> Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity ratio: 1 out of 5; Intelligence quotient: insignificant
