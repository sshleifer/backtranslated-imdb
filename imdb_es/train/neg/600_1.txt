...... in a horror movie that is. Very good first, let's start with Kate. Its main objectives include being tricked by George Clooney, looking good and last, but not least, ruining everyone. I have to love her. She had about 3 incredibly good chances of ending this illness, but ... instead, she ran. I mean, I did not want to take Guy out for 10 minutes and when he did it was too late. I mean the guy who tried to rape her. I can not go into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who, honestly, would feel sympathy for a guy that ends with everyone he has met in one night. The movie continued. And as a result he lost all his credibility.
