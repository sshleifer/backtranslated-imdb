After having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the very good Wrong Turn, I decided to choose this one instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all the films. I have not seen it yet, but considering that it is one of the most acclaimed horror films in history, I can say that I made the wrong decision. There's simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. I did not even have the youthful sexual appeal of mediocre to poor films like I know what you did last summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It just did not make sense, I did not have enthusiasm, I had very little interesting acting or convincing writing. The release date was apparently postponed several times for approximately one consecutive year, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie is presented as a bunch of pointless scenes thrown at random, with a meaningless effect. Win the wrong turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the super hot Elisabeth Harnois, but I do not think that even that would have made this film could be seen. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is horrible here, seems to lack intelligence and guts. That is enough in this case.
