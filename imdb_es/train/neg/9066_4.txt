This focuses on unitary notions of facing guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill rebukes the anguished child for quitting 'whining' for Rennie's death. Here are the real real men in action. <br /> <br /> The accident model and the car accident must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The narration itself, in spite of the flashback sequences, plays directly: we trust all the narrators (regardless of the "truth" or "falsity" of the dialogue), so there is no game for the viewer on the narrative structure. This would become an approximate template for future reps, such as "Fearless." <br /> <br /> So all we have left is individual performance, and at that level, it's better for Wynn's jokes, a virtual one. man show
