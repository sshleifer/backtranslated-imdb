WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen them all, The Hamiltons did provide a piece of entertainment, which was not the case. entertaining me at all! I thought that, as with the stupid plot scheme and bad acting, and the turn at the end of the movie, which was very retarded, this movie was a shit !! They are people who eat other people. Yes ...... note that I said people who are not human beings, not because they are not human, or wait, I think so, OH DO NOT WAIT, DO NOT TELL YOU !!!! So, are these people cannibals, or are they integrated, or what are THEY? I mean, maybe it's just "THINGS" that came here to see how people know or are cannibals who have eaten People for a long time, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT IT WAS! So, if you think The Hamiltons is good, I ask you why, why, why, why, why it was so incredible, because for me, it was just a terrible blow! A great BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of entertainment!
