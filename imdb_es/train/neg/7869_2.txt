Runners of time. The movie you can see if you are looking for a sophisticated form of suicide. Some use guns, ropes or gas, but do you want to ruin your brain? Do not wait more ! The corridors of time is probably one of the biggest mistakes possible: to think that Christian Clavier can act and bring him fun. I do not miss the 45 francs that this poor thing cost me: sometimes, you have to reestablish your evaluation system looking at absolute zero. This movie deserves a 2/10, but that's just because I like Jean Reno. Pity for him, also stars Ronin. I do not think I'll like it ...
