Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method to make movies, and before the digital triumph surpassed that. You understand. This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated these developments. Corin Nemec is exceptional as the author and narrator of N'er does it well. The pace is slow, but elegant, because the cinematography is very beautiful. Record the next time you're on T.V., because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia scam made for the T.V. movie. Direct to video never felt so good!
