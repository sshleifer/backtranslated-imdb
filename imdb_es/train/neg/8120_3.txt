At least among those films with 100 votes or more. Nominated for the best script written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leadership role? Nominated for a better photo? I always disagree with many of the Oscar elections, but this movie could be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the Academy. The writing and the acting were horrible. Blethyn's performance in particular was one of the worst I've seen, and probably the most overrated acting performance of all time. Horrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has reproduced it, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful that I did not pay to see one of the most overrated movies of all time.
