I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very scarce. The original plot and twists in the plot were obvious and could be guessed well in advance, even years before modern detectives see each other today. But it was fun to see the crazy patterns of sofas and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor mocking modern art for sale. The high-tech home is a version of Jetson's or Disney of Tomorrowland, and it's fun to think of the writers who invent those "exit gadgets." <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play, since there is much better. Episodes of columbo. Still, we should thank Cable TV that these episodes are being broadcast.
