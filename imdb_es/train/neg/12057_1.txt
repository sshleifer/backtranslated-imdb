Charles Bronson continued his fall of the 80s with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade, if not ever. In it he plays a detective who does everything possible to locate a pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling it to the highest bidder. It is a shameful attempt at action and is possibly the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider that the sequels of Death Wish are the worst Bronson films. The sequels of Death Wish were not great movies, but in most cases they were composed in a competent and highly visible way. Kinjite, however, is a completely boring thriller that is peppered with racism and child abuse. It really is a re-audible movie and everything is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a "Law and Justice" mentality that is too altered to say anything. In fact, the movie begins with the interruption of sex between minors with Bronson and then the violation of pedophiles anally with a dildo. The theater in Chicago where I watched this was breathless at the discomfort of this scene, only to gasp at the discomfort of the pimp who raped the girl in this movie. It does not make more sense than to explode and, in reality, the film was not written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and offer something that would work. Bronson seems more in things, but clearly this is too disgusting to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the best actor, but this effort is, ultimately, the worst. The action sequences are also deficient. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (horrible)
