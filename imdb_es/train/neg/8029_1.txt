A friend of mine bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never see it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic, but then my friends and I got bored and saw it. From beginning to end! I know it's a great achievement, but it's really a masterpiece. It is difficult to describe, you should see it, it is a real lesson about what people are capable of doing when they think they are creative and intelligent and they really are not. The "acting" is a sous terrain (actually, you can see the "main lady" laughing on some occasions, definitely the worst). The "story" is stupid to summarize and really everything in this movie was disgusting. Please pay special attention to the "sheriff". The boy is an adult and therefore has no excuse to get involved in this. He is extremely bad too. Whatever it was that had some fun moments. take a look, haha
