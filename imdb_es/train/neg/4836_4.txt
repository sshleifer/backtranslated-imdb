Let's start with the simple lines. On the side of the viewer, there are a couple of good "details of the director", some points of view in the movie scenes that are nice. The special effects are good enough, a good performance / good stage too. But the story is too simple. It shows how a bomb squad unit of the elite army lives, acts, and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my cinematic experience as a person would be "addicted" to the action movie, I lost that click that causes my eyes and my mind to be trapped on the screen. One of the things that should be present in a film for me to consider good is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and time of the film. It did not happen to me. I remained "conscious" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Honestly speaking, I think this movie won its place in fame based on the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a genuine and healthy feeling, but it is not the proper use as a movie fame generator . More than a movie about war, its popularity grows based on that. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: if this were a world war or an I film, only the change of time, with everything remained the same, would this award be? Surely not. Why? Because there are big ones that raise the bar high. <br /> <br /> Compared to their rivals at the Oscars, I do not think all the prizes they won are awarded correctly.
