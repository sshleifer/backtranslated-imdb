Being a fan of Go Nagai manga and anime (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I looked forward to this. I had not seen the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceived ideas when I entered. The good too. What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the kind that used to appear with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. While it is docile compared to what is dull in the throats of the usual cable viewers (the mischievous fragments of our hero are well hidden behind a scarf stuck strategically or adorned with a ridiculous effect of sunbeams), there are scenes prolonged ties and tortures that lend procedures enough to make them unsuitable for children. While I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like movies made by amateurs (there are at least four in this series). On the positive side, there is at least one incredibly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw. No wonder the Nagai TESTICLE BOY has never done it ...
