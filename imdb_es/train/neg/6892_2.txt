Oh my God. This was a real big disaster that simply could not help it. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not plan to go anywhere. Until her mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom she could be married. <br /> <br /> It would have been a good movie if Heder did not play Jeffrey so annoying, from the beginning. start, there's no chance that you like it and it just gets worse and worse. In the end, we're supposed to like it, but there was no reason, since it had not changed from the gross egoist it was at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even seem to try it and is in a horrible shape after 2007 because I said it. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where are they supposed to believe their mother and son? The only salvation is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they do not seem very interested either. Apart from a few smiles, this movie really does not deserve to be called comedy simply because there is hardly anything to laugh about! If you're in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton movie, see Mad Money or Smother, which are much better than this abysmal effort.
