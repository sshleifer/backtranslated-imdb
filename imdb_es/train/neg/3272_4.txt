I will say one thing about this movie: there are no moments of calm. You can not get bored watching this. The problem is that it is too intense. There is too much action and it NEEDS calm! That's the risk you run in modern action movies. You want it interesting but not exaggerated. This is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is good and presents a couple of "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a "B" movie. The best part is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mentality, but it did have some outstanding scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene with landmines. That was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a guardian for a long time.
