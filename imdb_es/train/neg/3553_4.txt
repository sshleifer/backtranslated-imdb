"The Incubus" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, poorly made attack scenes) and the strange (strong incestuous connotations, a strangely sleepy and rigid interpretation of John Cassavetes - Was that character really meant to be so "crazy"? Not as offensive as he's famous, but he's not particularly successful either (* 1/2)
