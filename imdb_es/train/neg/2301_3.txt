Does anyone think that this program really helps some people, or just angers the people who see it? When I'm flipping through the channels and I'm in this program, I look for morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. What I do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson is of little importance. He is an old man who thinks in an old way. The fear of condemnation no longer has the same effects as before (thank God). Now, if someone answers my question, I will be dodging the rays for the rest of eternity.
