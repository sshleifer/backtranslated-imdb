If I had reviewed IMDb BEFORE renting this Netflix DVD, I would have returned a couple of hours of my life. I am frankly suspicious when I see that the director of a film also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same type was "writer and director"; unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (eg, The scene of Judy Tenuta remembered her early comedy routines that promoted Judy-ism) that led me to rate these two stars instead of one. However, those moments were few and far between ... and I could hardly see them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. I admit that I saw that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me solve it once I had seen it all. No, although at least I recognized who the characters were that would be important later. The "rotating chamber" technique was overused and essentially useless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For God's sake, keep going!" Not recommended.
