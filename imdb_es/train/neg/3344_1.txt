I should start with this by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man develops some of the funniest action clich√©s imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler * even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a disabled child who carries a gun against a guy on a Harley with a machine gun, through a high hall of the school and the child wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: a great movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends for this and forcing them to sit down. Hilarious
