After buying the DVD in a bargain container due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I placed it in the DVD player and everything looked good. Good animated menus and a lot of additional features ... but when I played the movie, what a disappointment. It's the worst I've seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praises the film here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So do not believe it unless you want to waste your money!
