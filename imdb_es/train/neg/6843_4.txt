Very interesting black and white holding film written by David F. Friedman. The main actress, Stacey Walker, is well chosen and strangely attractive. She looks like a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This girl only made two of these movies and then moved to Texas. The music is terrible. Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) plays one of his boyfriends with a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in Tony's movie: "You're putting me on, doll, girls put me on". Good black and white photography by Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS and many others). Good places (cool pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange final but appropriate. A 4 out of 10. Best performance by Stacey Walker.
