- Let me start by saying that I understand that the invasion of the star creatures was destined to be a parody of the science fiction films of the fifties. I understand that none of this should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of that works. A parody should be funny and this simply is not. Not once during the entire execution time did I even smile. In general, I entertained easily, but I could not find any entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble from the beginning. The two "stars" make their appearance on the screen with one of the most unimaginable gags imaginable: a water hose that they can not control and that soaks both of them. These two come out as aspirants to the Bowery Boys. Why anyone would want to imitate the act and personality of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the little less than illustrious beginning, the films continue presenting sequences of chase comedians, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other bits without varied grace. It's just a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought this on the double-feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. That movie is an Academy Award winner compared to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
