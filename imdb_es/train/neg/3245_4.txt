The film debut of David Mamet has been hailed by many as a true movie for thinking men, a movie that makes you question everyone and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and I could not understand what was supposed to be so cool. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychologist named Margaret, who is also a best-selling author. Margaret has become disillusioned with her profession and her inability to really help someone. He tries to rectify this by helping to liquidate his patient's gambling debt with a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to see this movie). She discovers that Mike is actually a professional trustworthy man when he is almost the victim of a scam that he pulls immediately after meeting her. Intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how scammers work (he plans to use this as the subject of a new psychology book). Then he falls in love with him and accompanies him in a long scam that he and his partners have established. <br /> <br /> I do not feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were a scam developed by Mike and his friends to defraud Margaret of $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First of all, the big turn towards the end was VERY predictable. Any scene in which the scammers operated was made very obvious by the scenic performance and the strange reading lines. Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) know that they are dealing with scammers, so is it really a big surprise when we discover that Margaret has been swindled? In addition, Margaret is supposed to be an intelligent psychologist who is an expert in reading people, but she is too easily deceived, and given that she knows very well that Mike is a swindler. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we are led to believe that Margaret was cheated from the start, but for the scam to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the scammers could not have predicted she would do. First, he had to decide to help pay off his patient's debt, allowing him to meet the scammers in the first place. If she had not done this, the scam would have failed. I just have to say that it is not reasonable to assume that a psychologist will be in charge of solving a patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the chances that the scammers were in the right place the same night they decided to show up? Did they just show up at that bar every night, waiting for her to come and see them? Another thing that had to happen and that could not be predicted is that Margaret had to go back to see Mike and ask him to teach him the tricks of his trade. What are the chances of this happening? And, nevertheless, the whole problem is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was with the end. Margaret discovers that she has been swindled and decides to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet leads us to believe that he is going to cheat, but that does not materialize, so the last ending is that he is killing Mike in the luggage area of ​​the airport. Somehow, I felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about scammers who practice their craft. Not only that, but she did not even return the money she stole. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie makes you feel empty and dissatisfied. And if you, like me, predicted in advance that Margaret was going to be swindled, you will find this revelation equally unsatisfactory.
