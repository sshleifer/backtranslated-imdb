This is a Japanese movie, but there is also a bit of English spoken here. It is a beautiful film, with beautiful images, with the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, that was the only redeeming quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to see a young woman angry about 90 percent of the movie because her husband, "photo", is much older than he advertised? Of course, that could be an annoyance ... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes she makes a change of attitude and became attached to him. By then, for most viewers, it was too little, too late. We had fallen asleep by then.
