If you are the kind of spectator who enjoys the original content and intelligent suspense ... look elsewhere, children, because sleepwalkers really stink. I'm usually more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a trip home, she refuses, and then she is seen walking home. Where is your car? Anyway, I just do not see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but the words escape me. Cats jump over people. A boy stabbed by corn. Cheesey aligns the proverbial "wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I'll take that away! See it for the cameo of writer Stephen King as the guy who owns the cemetery. Actually it's pretty good. Even with the guest appearances of Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King offers the best interpretation of the film. But, apart from that ... wow ... BAD.
