Well, then, thank you very much Disney for DESTROYING the good memories that I used to have my PREVIOUS favorite movie. I was around 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I'm 16 years old and I feel quite masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. Therefore, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this regrettable excuse for a movie. This film takes everything it did original and endearing, down to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and they will show her that Everyone in the ocean ... BROYADAY STYLE! After the musical number ends, in a matter of minutes, the sea witch Morgana appears and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not abandon the trident. Therefore, he gives up without even fighting. Eric is left speechless, although Ariel discovers how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... uh, nothing of the note really happens. Eric is a total fool. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel does something. Melody manages to ruin things. In addition, the animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics end up crashing with funds. A unique opportunity for character development is always wasted. The songs itch. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure even small children will get bored with their skulls, since nothing even remotely exciting will ever happen. They will not want to sing the songs. If you manage to take a copy of this, throw it into the ocean and hope that no one will find it. Forever.
