"A Town Called Hell" (also known as "A Town Called Bastard"), a British / Spanish co-production, was made after the success of Clint Eastwood in the trilogy "Man With No Name" made in Italy. The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors whose careers were largely in decline and their voices doubled. This movie is no exception, except for the fact that some British actors also used it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to summarize the plot, but here it goes. The story begins with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Let's move on to the city in question a few years later, where the character of Shaw disguises himself as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who does not think about doing justice with his weapon. <br /> <br /> Throw in the mix an afflicted widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) who is looking for her murderous husband. Add to this the fact that she travels in a hearse like in a coffin because God knows why. After the mayor is killed by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is invaded by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (sorry, but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes control of the city and begins to summarily execute the townspeople to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Although they opened the film in parallel, it is difficult to tell from the dialogue that the characters of Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) says he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does it and .............................................. < br /> <br /> I'm sure the directors regretted making this movie. It's just horrible and worthy of my dreaded "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the movie setting his trademark look to whoever is useful. Even Landau can not save this movie. The beautiful Mrs. Stevens is totally wasted here as well. Having done "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" by Peckinpah the previous year, I found it strange that she appeared in this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these photos, ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) during the pre-Kojak period. Michael Craig is also somewhere as a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns", although he would emerge to play the villain in the two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri would also emerge with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and continue with other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the version I saw only lasted 88 minutes. Instead of the longer 95 or 97 minute run times listed in IMDb, however, I can not see where an additional 7 or 8 minutes would make a big difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
