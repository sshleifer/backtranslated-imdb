I should explain why I gave this "piece of art" a 1-star rating of the possible 10. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to rate it impartial. It would probably have been the same if I had given him 10/10. The explanations would have followed anyway. <br /> <br /> I do not like these nonsensical gore movies like HOSTEL or something like that. I think that's disgusting and pretty. Terrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I discovered after watching this movie, there is a genre called "historical drama", and it probably would have been the case for 10/10, since it has a lot of that and Tarantino would have been more that happy with that (and made Kill Bill 3 spill even more blood on the screen than here to show that it's possible). but what happens with the genre of "historical drama" is that it is a subcategory of the "garbage movies" where John Romero is the non-bloody-not-dead-guasante emperor, so he can not automatically be qualified as its predetermined Movie: since they are films that are made bad on purpose and really it is not possible to be said if the comically bad moment was thus, or simply was bad. It is for people who like to enjoy bad acting, bad script and everything else. And by some turn of faith, I am also one of them. There are days when I have the need to see a really bad movie and I look for some trash and here it is, the day is ready! but that is definitely an opinion of mine and does not coincide with anything else. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say is that if you want to see a terrible movie, then Casanova de Fellini is definitely the option. But follow my advice and do not rate it by default.
