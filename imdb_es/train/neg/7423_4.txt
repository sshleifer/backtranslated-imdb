There really is not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's pretty harmless, but it's little more than a boring 70s movie. The movie is not as smart or as sexy as it pretends to be. The plot is a retread of the old story of the casino robbery that has been done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year old boy. The plan involves three women ?? one to climb unnecessarily and to the naked eye outside the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to fly her cover at the first opportunity, and another to stand exposing her cleavage. That is almost everything. Intricate, huh? Apart from Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When Stevens does not like him, his participation in the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic weapons fights ever filmed. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It has that feeling of the 70 that I always enjoy and some good photos of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too boring to qualify for more than 4/10? and that is probably exaggerating. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of a perfectly good neckline.
