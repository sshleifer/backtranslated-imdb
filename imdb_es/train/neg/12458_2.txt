The premise of this movie is so simple and obvious that only a millionaire from Texas with a lot of oil and whiskey smoke would have trouble understanding if someone shouted through the proverbial parking lot. In summary: the oil business is in connivance with the Government (or Gummint, if you prefer), the Gummint is in collusion with the despots of the Middle East, and the CIA is a unique group of children of trade (insert) willing to To follow any line that is presented to them. The only people who are made are the good ones, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of the poverty that globalization creates when evil multinationals stalk the world in search of a tasty takeover or three. That really fits the profiles of the wealthy perpetrators of 9/11. <br /> <br /> In Syriana, this easy fabric of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is shaken into a vicious repellent of twisting stories. turn and turn through the gloomy circles of their own insignificance until the poor spectator is left alone with the conclusion that: <br /> <br /> 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be left near a camera again <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt can know how to act, but they do not know how to choose a script. <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big companies and in the state, go and see "L'ivresse du pouvoir" by Claude Chabrol, who is insightful, fun and of a brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Piffle sententious, empty and full of condolences, extended until the long night.
