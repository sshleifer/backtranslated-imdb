The only redemption was the small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was trying too hard to be "Something about Mary", but I did not even like that movie and it still did not meet those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is caught in the stupidity of his character of Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed to be trying to be the character of Randy Quaid of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies.
