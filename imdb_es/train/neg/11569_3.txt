Even if you subscribe to the antipersonnel policy of this film, it is still the same tired note, which is played over and over again and again. Clink clink clink Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles, Reverend Billy is hard to see as a serious figure. The Reverend Clown is the type who wakes up every morning with no more ethereal aspirations than watching his own face on television before going back to bed that night. I have a beautiful wife, I have to admit, but it would take a lot more than that to save the mess of a movie. The endless bus trips are the worst part (with the progress shown, can you guess?) By a line of color that moves across a map. Aww, you guessed it. Oh well, it has the virtue of being short. Is that the only favorable thing I can say? Hmmmm Yes, I'm scared.
