Commander Payne really was not very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was bad. Major Payne's voice and temper were especially annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
