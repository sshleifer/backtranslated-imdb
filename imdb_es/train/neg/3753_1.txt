Due to the strike of the United States Guild of 1988, they had to film this episode in 3 days. It's almost a crap, consisting of repeated cuts + clips stuck from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as "terrible, simply terrible". <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not just wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I guess because of the strike, the production ran out of money and could only launch a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at that time to be able to veto this half. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
