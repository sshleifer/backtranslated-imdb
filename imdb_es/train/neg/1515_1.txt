I saw the movie "The Flock" due to the casting of Gere and Danes and because the synopsis of the story sounded interesting. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen some turkeys). I had never posted online before, but this movie was so horrible I had to do it. I guess the problems start with the script that was so amateur that it's amazing. The story has no meaning and the dialogue is so trite that it nausea. Poor Gere, he deserves much better. As for the confrontation of Gere / Danes on screen, due to the horrible writing, one does not believe any of the characters for a single minute. I bet Gere would like to buy the negative, if possible. It is a shame to see that the talent is wasted so much, without mentioning that I wish I could recover my 2 hours. (I know what you're thinking, how do I really feel?)
