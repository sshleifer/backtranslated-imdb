AKA: Mondays In The Sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just saw. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, complaining about everything and everyone in their way. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of film, without a single redeeming quality. <br /> <br /> I have read reviews that say that the performances in this document are "wonderful," "beautiful," and "heroic." I am afraid that I can not agree, unless these men supposedly came out as the most foolish and ignorant protohumans who have ever walked. <br /> <br /> Everything in everything? This was not a movie. He wanders everywhere and loses everyone except the public. I have seen this three times, and for my life I can not see what someone sees in this garbage. There is nothing deep here, not at all. It's bullshit. <br /> <br /> Rate a ZERO / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
