This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a movie for the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights, then do not do the damn movie. I must say that I can see Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I can see the trailer of this POS from a movie. Adam Sandler should be restricted from any movie after this misfortune. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your cock in a blender. Anyone with half a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give it to the support foundation Lorraina Bobbitt before buying this movie.
