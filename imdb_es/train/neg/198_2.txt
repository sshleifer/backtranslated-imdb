Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you would never know about this heavy-duty mess. This film not only seems cheap, it's cheap, most of the battle scenes are removed from the very superior "The Last Command" of 1955, and that recording, filmed 32 years earlier, seems more contemporary than any other image in this image. The few action scenes that were shot for this film are disorganized, confused and incompetent, and look as bad as the rest of the image. This has the appearance of a bad movie for students (and the budget does not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, the performance for the most part is on top ham or lower comatose, although Raul Julia comes out better than most of the rest of the cast, and is full of annoying historical inaccuracies. Besides that, it's too long. If you are going to make a boring movie, do it in about an hour and finish it at once. Do not stretch it more than three hours, as it does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out the John Wayne version of 1960, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. It's hard to believe that six producers had a hard time making a movie this way. Skip it.
