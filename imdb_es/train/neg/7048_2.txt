I chose this movie because of the cover that was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. I had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a "theme" of surfing that had nothing to do with surfing or real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just because she is in the limelight now, she is married to Gordon Gekko and all that, but if you have not seen her, do not waste time. IN BAD HAND OF GOD, a bad movie with GREAT surf, REAL surfers and an INCREDIBLE AND BEAUTIFUL cinematography.
