This film presents a great variety of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them generates any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping things would improve and I would end up staying until the end, but there was no reward for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me the action is not worth telling. It's not that the story was so bad, I guess you could say that I had some problems with the script, that is. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there is a pretty strong cast here, which has not been used. Most of the old professionals in this movie do good jobs; Of the actors I had not seen much before, I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can say about this photo.
