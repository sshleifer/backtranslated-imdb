When it comes to horror films, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore below-average production values ​​and ignore the plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movie simply does not have good fears to offer. You can not even enjoy yourself in the camp. The bad dialogue, the bad performance, the bad direction, the murders were predictable and badly organized, the music was annoying, the work of the camera was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who obviously tried, but who had to deal with a terrible and artificial dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they have any essays, either. It is shameful to see it, and so boring that reaching the end artificial "surprise" requires tremendous resistance. It is easily one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not write reviews, but this was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you must see this movie, do not miss the "Making of" -featurette. The writer / director seems to have the impression that turning the murderer into a woman was a bold and daring move. (I've seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it were a "citizen Kane" of a new era. It's like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas contest. They really believe that they have created some substance. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities, like "Hands: Hands of Destiny" and "Space Riot". So "American Nightmare" is not the WORST movie I've ever seen, but I must say it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.
