If this movie was a comedy, I would have given it a 10. Oh my, where do I start? Put it this way: I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this makes Troll 2 look like the stranger Saving Private Ryan. It is as if a group of pornographic filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds in the middle of the production and decided to do a comedy, then return to horror and then decide that they should have stayed with pornography (that's all). Everything about this movie is just terrible: the musical score (someone shot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the direction, the cinematography, the acting. There are simply no words to describe this. Oh, wait, yes, there is: Holy $ *%!
