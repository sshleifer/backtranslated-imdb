Wow! This is one of those movies that you think you've reviewed previously, but you did not. I mean, you did not care about anything, but somehow it came to mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and brief; This is one of the worst, boring and stupid thugs that have ever been made. I can not say anything good about this piece of shit because there are barely decent sequences that you could say are made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is a good thing considering that he copied "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this is not a bad movie that is good. It is simply bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do the best she could, but it was not enough.
