I've always liked Fred MacMurray, and although his career was tragically short, I think it's fun to see Carole Lombard. Combine these two main and attractive stars, add to the best support players like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, join them to the outstanding director Mitchell Leisen and you will obtain a mediocre cinematographic experience. <Br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet" during their visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric both in his rise and fall. During his rise to musical stardom, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start again after he has bottomed out. Ah, yes, it is the true happy ending of Hollywood, which does not come too soon. <br /> <br /> The stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it's hard to look at sometimes. The first scenes set in Panama are so risky that they seem to last forever, and then an alcoholic Skid wanders nonstop in New York. Fred and Carole do their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W address just do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, simply does not sound true. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen once to see some of the early performances of the stars MacMurray and Lombardo. However, I guarantee that watching it will seem to take approximately 48 hours.
