Saving Grace is undoubtedly one of the main contenders for the award 'How to ruin a suitable film in the final few minutes'. Naturally, if you mix a quaint village in Cornwall, largely populated by retired gentile ladies, with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of nonsense will occur. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend to the totally ridiculous and not even redeem for being particularly fun. It's a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be as good as Waking Ned Devine from 1998, which also portrayed a quaint little town and its strange inhabitants trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is Grace Trevethyn, middle-aged and recently widowed, whose legacy of uncollectible debts from her husband has forced her to access an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she converts her horticultural experience into the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads to a confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . that all occur simultaneously in your greenhouse. The relationship and the relationship between Grace and Matthew is well represented, and Brenda Blethyn manages to get the viewer emotionally involved with their nice character: you can really feel what is happening. <br /> <br /> The cast of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are somewhat extravagantly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques, the drug trafficker in Grace's romantic interest, is highly implausible and does not at all conform to the tone of the film. And surely hydroponics is not a revolution in the growing cannabis world? Unfortunately, the film exchanges soft humor for slapstick and ends up being as false as marijuana plants.
