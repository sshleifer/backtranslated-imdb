"Fungicide" is possibly the "incompetent, shameful and pitiful" movie I've seen in my life. The acting is criminal, the direction practically non-existent and the special effects presumably combined when untying a monkey with learning difficulties in a helpless laptop. <br /> <br /> Far from repressing creativity, but I really believe that things like these should not be done. I am sure that the makers of the "movie" will say that, yes, the "movie" was hampered by a low budget (as in nothing), but in that case they should not have bothered. As things are, they have offered the world something so serious, so execrable, that only imbeciles could enjoy it with a mere pleasure to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Starting the "movie" was not like I was waiting for "citizen Kane" or anything. I expected a small horror of low budget, perhaps with a minimum of inventiveness, a touch of fun and even some energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our anti-hero scientist, who works in his parents' basement, looks maniacally stirring something in a cup. Apparently, such high-level science is the end result of years of research. His parents send him to a strange place in the countryside to relax. There are other people there, who are simply too frightening to write about them. Anyway, the scientist drops his test tube on some mushrooms, and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm committing suicide just by writing the summary of the plot). Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (by placing a "fuse", actually a piece of string). The barrel explodes inexplicably with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> That summary is as good as the "movie" gets (and it actually makes it look a lot more interesting than it really is). I really should never have got past this stage of development (so I'm referring to a plot scheme written on the back of an envelope with crayons). Someone should have really intervened and given a vigorous shake to someone and said "NO". <br /> <br /> And those "special" effects. Well, they are "special" in agreement. This is CGI crazed. And made by a person I can only assume, believes that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when mushroom monsters are not in the style of a packet of 1984 home computer graphics, they are represented by actors who crawl along a sheet (no kidding). <br /> <br /> One of the most inexcusable things about the film is its laziness. This can be summed up in the scene in which the hero turns his arms (to Clint Eastwood) and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets. I mean, come on, a couple of repetitions and he could have done it, but only to leave it as it is, really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that money will be spent on this garbage from the camcorder. The creators of the "film" should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty yards of any film making team. <br /> <br /> I also think it's wrong for friends and family of creators to go to IMDb and post mendacious comments and offer stupidly high user ratings that give a totally inaccurate picture of the "movie". The "fungicide" is an absolute farce of cinema. Mr. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
