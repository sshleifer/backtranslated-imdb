This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it is not a comedy. In a classic scene, Kurt Thomas has just found a horse pommel in the middle of a town square (used to hit the bad guys). Another is the trip to the "Aldea de los locos". Too bad that this movie was not made to be a farce, or it may have obtained better grades.
