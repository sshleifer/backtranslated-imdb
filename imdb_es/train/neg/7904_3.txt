Small ridiculous looking boogers that breed foam and reproduce alone. So far, for the horror elements that this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES is presented as a very delayed comedy that is so stupid that you will not find it funny after about 15 minutes. I can imagine young children encouraging these little snotty, but adults will be left with only those supposedly "smart" references that will translate to things on the screen like Captain Kirk's STAR TREK registry entries, ET's most well-known scene , a blatant statement from the filmmakers saying: "Look, we are taking advantage of GREMLINS 'success here!" and a cardboard cutout by Clint Eastwood that tells us ... what about his western movies exactly? That last was totally lost in me ... Oh, yeah, and the disposal of chemical waste in caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got that idea from. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie, by the way. It is really very, very silly. And if you manage to smile while you see it, you probably feel so foolish for having done it after the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes, but only if the criteria you are seeking are "stupid", "retarded" and "ridiculous". 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
