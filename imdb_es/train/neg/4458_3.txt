Most of the French films I've seen, and enjoyed, were more conversation than action, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at one point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in all the French films that have been made! It seemed so.) <br /> <br /> This movie has the same interesting visual effects and had a good opening . But then it turned into conversation, conversation and more conversation ... which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching this. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie looked more like a play with almost all the scenes in one room. Therefore, if you love plays, you should like this ... but I want a little more for a murder story.
