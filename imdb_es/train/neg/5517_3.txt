I only rate this movie as 3 out of pity because it tries to be worth it. I love praising a great movie and I'm not predisposed to "male" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent movie. The Rule of Georgia, on the other hand, was an example of disorganization, weakness, poorly written, unrealistic filmmaking at its worst. At the end of the film I did not care who was lying or if something was resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good HISTORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep, does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one who experiences a major character change, and is prepared for that change throughout the film. In the Rule of Georgia, character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Second, there were too many TRYED dynamic characters. Achieving a really good dynamic character is a difficult job and it takes time (you only have a couple of hours in a movie). That means too many attempts at dynamic characters will get too little attention to your personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written history and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say that I liked someone. Each character was a disaster. That's fine if you're writing American Beauty but not when you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no, I'm not missing her because she was abused, the shit happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions ). The Mormon child "Dudley Do Right" should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and his commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of man allows a 17-year-old girl who has been molested to just stay from time to time (unless an actor or a politician). It's worth watching this movie if you want to remember what it is NOT to make a good movie.
