Wow ... where to start ... I picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. That's three dollars that I'll never see again ... never ... and for what? I'll tell you One hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring and college-boring conversation that seemed more appropriate for a lifetime movie than the horror movie announced on the box. (That the marketing droids that designed it burn in hell for all eternity). Follow with a little cheap gore (not even a good gore matters to you ...) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. Horrible, frightening, frightening ... <br /> <br /> Were there some redeeming qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but that's not worth it for the three dollars lost. Without those, this could have been in science fiction at two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
