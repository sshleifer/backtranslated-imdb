Oh dear sir. This movie ... it was horrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, I like horror movies that other people say are bad. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I'll say it. But this plot was horrible. It did not make sense! He had too much blood, and a scene of unnecessary (and disgusting) sex at first. I think the director was trying to be "shocking" or whatever, but it came out horrible. To add to the pile of trash they called a plot, the actors (as well as 'scarecrows') are terrible, and I cared so little that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, please do it.
