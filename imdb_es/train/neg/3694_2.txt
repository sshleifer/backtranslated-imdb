This is undoubtedly the worst movie of Rajnikanth. The first part remains in place with the solid comedy of Goundamani, but every time it gets worse and is completely illogical. Our hero also investigates the saints with the same name (Baba) through a corny and absolutely lame one line. The first half makes Rajni pronounce his usual variety of eyeliners and style, and in the second half, he becomes an almost saint after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous one) Saints to whom he did an excavation before) He has special powers for no apparent reason (apart from karma). This is starting to get interesting, is not it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about him wasting his blessings and magical powers and fighting against politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable trash with hilarious implementation. Oh, and black magic never worked in our hero because he only had one Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual political villains are clich√©s, they work excessively and, in the end, they are completely insignificant to the plot, which in itself is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the shortcomings, it was fun to kill time with and scream Baba related to a single line during public events. It is also fun to see others curse about this movie. It is said that AR Rehman composed the tracks for his film through the cell phone. That's the important thing that considered it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of that. But the way they are represented, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after seeing that. This movie was probably promotional material for Rajni to enter politics, but the results of the film itself would have ended any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> However, it would be fun if you disconnect your brain.
