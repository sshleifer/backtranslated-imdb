Here is an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "under budget" a horrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization". Students are irremediably killed from false matches of submarine sandwiches and school flight supplies. It sounds like a resurrection of the classic movies of the 50s, right? No It is not an example of fun in the high camp, which is a way, very far from the brand. A glamorous showcase of breasts and buttocks gives rise to our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. The best entertainment at the bottom of the barrel, helped by pints of red blood and corpses of dead students. Atrocious movies like this one would make the catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a master's degree in film production. It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
