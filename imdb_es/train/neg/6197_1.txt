At the end of the film I asked myself: "Is it the worst movie I've seen or is it the worst movie I've seen?" And the answer is ... Actually, after you've seen this movie and thought a little about its meaning, you can not find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes, which are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to push this question into the head of the crowd: "What are these crimes compared to the horror of war and extermination?" because I realized that the two horrible scenes were directly related to the war and its horrors (during the first scene you can see the girl who is being raped screaming and at the same time you listen to one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start a war With Iraq and in the second scene, the images of the three criminals nailing a sword in a woman's vagina are followed directly by the archive images of the Second World War.But as a matter of fact, I really could not think In the relative gravity of these two different types of expression of human horror, having finished, I was very surprised by what I had just seen and felt (sorry for the bad English)
