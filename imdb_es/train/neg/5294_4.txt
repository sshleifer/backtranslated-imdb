Keanu Reeves plays a friend of a popular high school student who suddenly commits suicide ... he and his friends go through an emotional turmoil and share their reactions to this horrible incident ... Good performance of Reeves and a young Jennifer Rubin .. but in general it is a little too .. 4 out of 10
