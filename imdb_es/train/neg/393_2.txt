For anyone who wants a remake of Slaves of New York in 1989. What's up, seven of you? Here it is ... it was. <br /> <br /> This not very well-cooked movie has unusual student characters (Well, they're club boys, you big jerk!) that have waiting patterns. The big question seems to be, how long can a young adult stay young? Did it take three people to write this 'story'? My God, it was easier to find Citizen Kane. Instead of recovering the viewers, this film should only embarrass anyone who was an expert on the scene in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman envies a group of children self-absorbed in a different way. The era is the world as only self absorbed, twenty-something could imagine it. The odd sidebar on the work of the library is not the secondary plot expected from the equivalent of Breaker 2: Parker Posey's Electric Bugaloo. Its "I'm serious about graduate school!" While a stripper crushes her, she is hysterical. Posey's trick is always fun, but there are projects that are under it. I was asleep before the 40-minute break.
