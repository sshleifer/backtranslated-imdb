This really does not do justice to the blues. It begins badly with images of the Voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrates from outer space (?) And tells us the life stories of several blues musicians. Corny as it is, this could be the most visually interesting part of this documentary. Afterwards, all you have to see are the actors who speak incompetent classic melodies, filmed in fake black and white scenes of the 20s with characters like Beck and Shemekia Copeland, who then violate the same songs. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so cool, but they do not do it for a convincing visualization. There is almost nothing here that can justify being a film and not a radio play. No one should be forced to see these recreations wrongly made. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
