Well, I could not even enjoy this movie very much for its cult values. It is a B movie action film, by the director of "Comando", which however is too stupid and stupid to consider it a good B-movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> It's a 90's movie, but most of all the movie should be reminiscent of an 80's action movie, when these kind of B movies were at their highest point. These films were always exaggerated and never paid much attention to their history or performance. It was about flying things, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This movie has all those ingredients, but I still did not like watching this movie, because I like to watch similar movies. It's hard to say why really, since the story and the acting are as bad as in the case of any other genre film from the same era. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the movie is often far away. Too silly All this kind of movies have their silly moments, but this movie is full of that. The fight, Dolph Lundgren running shirtless, the characters, the story. Simply, everything is not very good because it is often too scarce for words. The story sometimes does not even try to make any sense and what is the main plot of the film in general? His story is really everywhere and it seems that it is only written to create a movie with fight sequences, gun fights and things like that. And those sequences are not so good to really see. The moments are too short and quite disappointing to see them really, on the part of the man who brought us the "Command". <br /> <br /> It's first and foremost a Dolph Lundgren, in which he plays the great star of the action hero, who kicks with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle weapons and other weapons and, of course, also receives the girl, played by Tia Carrere. All this also brings us one of the worst montage sequences in the history of the action movie and also one of the worst sex sequences I've seen in any movie. Both are too lazy for words and very badly organized. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really works. The good guys are cops, but they never seem to behave like one. They simply kill without having to face anyone's responsibility and are not very interested in making any arrests or informing anyone about their discoveries. Not even when they learn that a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take the streets of L.A. and a brewery is working as a cover for a drug factory and large-scale drug smuggling. And also think about it for a moment, what is the overall purpose of Brandon Lee in the movie? The film could easily have been made without him and the girl too. <br /> <br /> Too silly, lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
