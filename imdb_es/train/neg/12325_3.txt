I remember that show. I still remember that funny song "America's Funniest People". Frankly, I should have been titled People of American, not honest or downright disgusting. Dave was unable to save this program and Bob Saget or the replacement hosts for AFV who arrived later. The Jackalope segments were fun and yes, Dave could make some good voices that were better than Bob's. But this program went to hell because of the bad videos that people sent. It was also developed as a variety show with guest stars like the Olson Twins. In addition, AFV was at its peak before they began to choose the ugly slugs as the babies of sin as the winner. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the subject of the theme rocks!
