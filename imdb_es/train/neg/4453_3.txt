I'm sure that people who see this movement outside of Britian, this movie will be an entertaining watch, but for someone from the UK it is painful in their mistakes. <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning of the movie, Elijah Wood realizes. out of a tube at the Bank station, which has been smashed. He tells his sister, whom he is meeting, "What happened here" and she responds "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday!" Tottenham is already in the city ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! And if the Tottenham fans wanted to fight with other fans, the last place on earth they would be at the Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are several other similar ones. mistakes, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the hooligan leader. Clearly, he decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and, instead, opted for a Dick Van Dyke style drill that made my ears bleed. It was accentuated by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke of the way one would expect West Ham fans to talk. This mistake made it incredible on paper and really ruined the movie.
