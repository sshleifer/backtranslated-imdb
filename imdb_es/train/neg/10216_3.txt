Stronger than fiction it infuriated me so much that I enrolled in IMDb just to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, moving and stimulating film until the end. Once you suspend several logical lapses (why did not Will Ferrell hear the voice of Emma Thompson 10 years ago when she started writing her book?) The phone rang and the phone rang again. "How could she not know? who is he calling? Etc.), the film challenges one's thoughts on mortality, destiny and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain the former English graduates. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, though Will Ferrell could be as easily an ax killer as a clumsy soul. His quick confidence in him is a great leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Oh, but the end. Until the end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie. The film as a metaphor for the journey of life, as a tribute to the notion of "writing truth", as a reminder that great literature is comedy or tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The entire film leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's destiny. And no matter how attractive the character he has become, we know very well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen turns white, the credits roll. A deep and powerful ending to an almost perfect movie. An ending that would have been debated for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! There are no credits rolled. Say it's not like that. Let's say that Hollywood did not take advantage of another 10 minutes of trash that completely undermined the integrity and the heart of the movie. Dustin Hoffman understood it well when he said: "It's no longer a masterpiece, it's fine." A good review of the movie. Except for me, it was not even good. I was so offended by the betrayal of "writing true" about the decision to please the film that I really burst into tears of rage explaining this on the trip home after the movie. I do not cry often. I could care less about most movies, but I'm still angry about this one. <br /> <br /> My questions for Zack Helm, the writer, are the following: did the original film end when the screen went blank? And were you forced by the film's vain source of power to approach an unfaithful ending to the core of the movie? Or did you make that final maudlin in yourself? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original script finished the movie the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this revision, and I have not been able to find a contact to ask me. But, please, moviegoers, am I the only one who feels that way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me when I saw this movie: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now.
