I have never found Charley Chase very funny, although his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Gowky Hen Broon from the 'Sunday Post' comics page in Scotland.) In the best Chase films, I tend to admire his professionalism instead of laughing at him. I'll give credit to Chase that his best films, like 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' - have inspired a fan who is very loyal to him ... but I'm sure that even the most Chase fans will agree that the very early and very rude 'Married to Order' is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase: anxious, clumsy, no gums, naff - is a young Swain hoping to woo the beautiful Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as his hardened father, who scorns Chase as a 'mollycoddle'. Leo White, who did a more remarkable job as foil for Chaplin in Essanay, is present here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is some action with an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand was mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a major flaw in 'Marry an Order' is the cast of Rosemary Theby as Rose: she is destined to be a standard naive, but Theby, with flat chest and hawk face, - It's physically wrong because of the paper. Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a film actress, but was never a credible naive. Film historian William K Everson treated her very contemptuously in one of his film books. <br /> <br /> I will qualify 'Married to Order' only 3 out of 10, and I am being charitable ... because I still suspect that Charley Chase has something that everyone else gets but I still lose.
