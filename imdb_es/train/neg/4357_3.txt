A group of friends come face to face with a family of disgusting cannibals while they camp in the beautiful German countryside. <br /> <br /> The concept of "mutant cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills that consanguineous fans. He often calls home, so any director who tries to give a new life to the genre must come up with something quite special to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give a teutonic turn to the routine, by transplanting the action to the Black Forest and the low-budget German splash treatment. The result is a very bloody effort, but totally unoriginal, which can be almost unnoticed thanks to some terrible management decisions, in particular, the continuous use of sophisticated filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose not choose to use all the tricks that his editing software offered him, then Barricade could have been a pretty entertaining gore-fest: his inexperienced cast does it reasonably well; The bloody effects are suitably stomach upset; and there are one or two fears and even some well-conceived spooky moments. All this, however, is completely ruined by the horrific camera work, choppy editing and the large amount of visual contraptions used to give the film the anguished look that is so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the extravagant gore, which includes an ingenious scene in which a boy is forced to drink acid, a lot of unpleasant wounds caused by a variety of implements sharp, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.
