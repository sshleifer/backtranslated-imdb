Primary species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when their cargo turns out to contain living dinosaurs. The army command team now has to think fast, if they want to avoid the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and you get your first impressions of the movie. That is basically everything. The performance is only acceptable from a few characters. The story is poor, with the whole movie based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This movie came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this movie seems to have come out 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The disguises of the dinosaurs are so badly made, and I mean the costumes. Obviously there are people in disguise, and this movie does not try to hide this. A scene in which a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it seems that someone is riding the creature. It's a good thing, that comes out of this movie. The short execution time. With only 1 hour and 15 minutes, do not waste your life very much, but still try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday nightmare 13". - Officer (Brian Currie)
