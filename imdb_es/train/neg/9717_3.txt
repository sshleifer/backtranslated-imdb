A thriller by numbers quite obvious, in which the only possible turn turns out to be a hiding place to nothing. I was mainly watching the English language performance of Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if half of their contribution had been left in the cutting room along with several last-minute scripts that were rewritten. <br /> <br /> The acting is the least attractive of this movie. . Steve Guttenburg seems to be trying to develop his role with the charm that everyone has told him he has. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which it is suggested that your sexual prowess may help treat post-traumatic stress disorder. It is an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more a draw with genuine charm and character, but it's a small consolation. 3/10
