Carl Monson, a Z-grade horror filmmaker, was one of the most prolific directors working in the field of low-budget bloody chaos. His films are full of inept blood, ridiculous performances, boring plots and boring dialogues. A mysterious black dress. The figure is savagely murdering guests staying in the family mansion. Unfortunately, this movie has almost no blood. You do not really see the murders, except with shadows and some splashes of blood. The pace is lethargic and the plot is not very interesting. The acting is merely competent, but the lack of blood and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Be careful: do not confuse Monson's film with the equally weak "Blood Legacy" of Andy Milligan.
