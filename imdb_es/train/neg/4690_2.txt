This British film is really horrible, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, even though he almost does it at night. The idea of ​​a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train ends up parked for most of the movie! There is no action, there is no movement, only a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger for anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a thriller. The true suspense is generated by allowing the audience to know things that the characters do not know, a fact that apparently is unknown to the director. SPOILER: the train actually has two bombs, but we are led to believe that there is only one. After the first pump is deactivated, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. We're also not sure WHEN the bombs will shoot, so we do not even have a classic voltage sequence "tick-tock bomb". They spend about 10 minutes or more looking at Glenn Ford's French wife thinking about leaving him, and then wondering where she is. He's such an annoying character that we do not care if he reconciles with him, so when he does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are quite devoid of personality, and none have any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's tedious and boring. Do not waste your time.
