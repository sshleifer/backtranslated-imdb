It's interesting at the beginning. A naive ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful and mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) who is only known for a short time. They seem happy, then she disappears without warning. He looks for her and, after some dead ends, he runs into something of his abused childhood and his recent and sordid past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems that the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, although not as suspense as it seems, at least is observable. Then it stops being interesting or even makes a lot of sense. And the ending is so boring, so boring, and so devoid of enthusiasm and intelligence, you will think that the writers did not know what to do with that and got bored when trying. What a lost loss of a good idea!
