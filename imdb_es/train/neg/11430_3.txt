Well, let me coin a new word here: polyphobia: the fear of polyamorous relationships. This is yet another in a long list of movies that start with exciting audiences about some kind of trio, just to earn a dime and preach about how it is so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamist solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the pleasure of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in a few decades, polyphobia is going to be a big false step like homophobia, but guess who had a very closed mind to realize this? Just the first time: the producers of this movie. And many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and antiquated movie like this one? He prides himself on having an unlimited mentality about homosexuality and overlooks the fact that we live in a time when monogamy is becoming sequential monogamy, which in turn becomes swing and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing and current chick movie. (But, damn it, I have to say that Heather Graham is the cutest thing in the world.) <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
