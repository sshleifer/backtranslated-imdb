I must admit that there are few books with corresponding films that I have read before watching the film adaptation. Nineteen eighty-four is one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and curiously prophetic. But the movie just sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half a two-part task for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but he did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. The performance was not above average, and considering the fact that there was not much to represent, this was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston could not release more than one syllable at a time. Bored, unsettling, and visually unattractive, the film totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second ... Is not he British?
