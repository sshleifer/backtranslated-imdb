After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I really loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and chose Seed because I stumbled into a local DVD store and it is supposed to be one of his best works. films. <br /> <br /> While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed to be the beginning of a psychological thriller not too conventional, it soon went downhill from there and eventually became one of the More generic slasher movies that I've seen so far, which include a lot of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and a sub-par performance. It seems that Boll did everything possible to create a decent plan, but after a while he simply gave up. Maybe I should stick to comedy ?! The few good things about this movie is that it manages to create a creepy atmosphere in general, that the special effects are better than I expected and that the soundtrack adapts well to the atmosphere in general, but the unbalanced rhythm of this movie is combined with the highest quality. Its generic nature makes the half-hour long quite tedious to see, which ruined my experience completely. There are striking scenes quite well done, but they seem to be there only because of the shock value. And let's not forget the camera work that was sometimes quite nauseating. <br /> <br /> I hope that Uwe Boll someday learns what makes a good movie, because among many horrible movies it seems that it makes a decent movie. shoot from time to time Seed simply is not one of those.
