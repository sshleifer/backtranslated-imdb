I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was nothing more than a very dull standard detective program in which, according to any Quinn Martin program, the act was murder, Act II was the main character that determined the murder, Act III it was the turn of the plot (another character killed), Act IV was the resolution and the epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he discovered the crime and then someone said something witty in the end of the Show. <br /> <br /> One thing I do remember was the excellent and excellent song of the late great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Interestingly, the opening credit sequence made me want to watch the show from time to time during the seven seasons when the show was broadcast. I must also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett even though Ebsen is very ill informed. I just wanted the program to be more entertaining than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through his Archive of American Television channel. Let's say I was kinder than Goldsmith on the "Barnaby Jones" show.
