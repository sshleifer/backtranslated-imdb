I really hate this show! I had seen an episode and I knew that this program is really terrible. The story lines are misspelled and executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, it's just a fake scam by Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, about an obnoxious boy with blond hair flamed with his twin Sisters genius and talking dog ; a father who stays at home and a smart mother and super busy ... Like my God! His father is a family nut, he is not so gay! If my dad is a housewife, I would personally die! From the shame it is ... I really would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to do with this ... this parody but only 3 words; count them 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Lick, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say, folks, it's definitely making my list of the worst EV-ER animated series! If I had one that is.
