['Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike seems unable to move the wheels with this clumsy thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto&#39;s book about an evil old woman (and child molester!) Who is part of a new urban legend: if her cell phone it sounds with a strange tone, and the message &quot;A missed call&quot; appears: it will replay the message only to hear its own final words before its death. The most successful part of the movie is the biting satire of Reality TV cameras that intrude on future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a piece of hidden red candy) are disappointing and discouraging. Frequent shots of devastated corpses are actually shown quite discreetly, and this courtesy in general may be the reason why the film is, ultimately, so serious. Hollywood, as expected, jumped into the unlikely plot in 2008, but the US version was not better. NO STARS OF ****']
