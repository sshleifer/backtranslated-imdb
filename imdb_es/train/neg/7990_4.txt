'Anita and I' is a drama about how to grow in multi-ethnic Britain, like 'Bend it Like Beckham', or more closely, 'East is East', with which it shares the stage of the 70s. The tone is decidedly chirpy (in spite of the accents of Black Country), but the film lacks "This is the vigor of East and the result seems quite thin and trite". In addition, the representation of the central relationship of the film, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is not deep enough to justify the way the film is structured around her. I have also grown tired of the films in which the hero became a writer, this is, of course, often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a new element in a fictional story. "This is the East" was fun and sharp; 'Anita and I' seems obvious and boring in comparison.
