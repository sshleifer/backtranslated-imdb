****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> The radio presenter Kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to get a paycheck in this insipid, sporadically observable haunted house parody. Lugosi is a mystic whose sessions are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to cheat the fortune of an heiress; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes the fake mediums, but it turns out that both are conspiring with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his band of "children" over 30 years old discover the truth with as little humor as possible along the way. It is not recommended to anyone, but the completista of absolute horror.
