Decent enough with some elegant images, however, the small budget makes things difficult. <br /> <br /> I also have the impression that they were trying to surprise you with some of the things on the weirdo perv graphic website. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in things like the cyber city and AD police, this could go up your street. <br /> <br /> but basically your low budget matrix cash, however, is not totally lacking in your own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack of some amazing grunge / punk / post grunge bands. It's worth taking a look, if only for the soundtrack.
