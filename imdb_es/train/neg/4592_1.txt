This movie angered me a lot. I desperately wanted to strangle the "scientists" and invisible filmmakers during the course of it. Very, very painful to sit through. Sofomorico and pretentious in the worst way. The little useful information about brain / chemical function and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​new horses. The worst offenders were the charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead mediocre lives and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I basically agree are presented in such a harsh, clumsy, superior, pretentious and preaching way that I felt the desire to reject them. I think that was what made me angry, the fact that they took really deep aspects of established scientific thinking and tarnished them with their new Hokum era. Much of this is based on the fallacy of applying the concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Appropriately, the parts dramatized with Marlee Matlin are fans and have a cliché. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would recommend to people the excellent science survey by Bill Bryson: "A brief history of almost everything". There are many deep wonders about life and the universe in current and established science.
