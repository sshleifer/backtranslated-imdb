I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that, until the end, I expected the acting instructors of the cast to intervene and apologize for how poor the acting was. When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant stage and the effort made to create a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a pity that little attention has been paid to the performance. <br /> <br />
