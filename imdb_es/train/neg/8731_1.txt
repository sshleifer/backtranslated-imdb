the lowest possible score is a star? it is a pity. Actually, I'm going to press IMDb for a "zero star" option. To give this movie, even a single star is giving way too much. Am I the only one who noticed the microphones hanging over the head of the hopper at the station? And the acting, or should I say the lack of it? Apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. The talents program of my little sister's elementary school offers greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake Irish accents were like nails on a blackboard. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been ... oh, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it can be.
