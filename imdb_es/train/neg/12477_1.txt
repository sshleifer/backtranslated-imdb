This is one of those movies in which you and a group of friends sit down to drink beers, eat pizza and laugh. Unfortunately for me, I found myself watching this alone. My friends and I rented a large block of movies and we could never see this one. It was time to go back and I thought it was a waste not to see it. So I did, and I was impressed by how absolutely terrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad films a little, and I probably would have liked this if the "hero" was not. so absolutely disgusting The whole movie was waiting for him to bring down that stupid sword and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic things in the movie. It's a stupid thing, disgusting and disgusting. He has less redeeming qualities than villains. And what was it with all the naked girls? I mean, I love nude girls as much as the other guy, but this movie was a bit overdone in that department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you like bad movies and you can stand a disgusting "hero" then I'm sure you'll like this pile of movies.
