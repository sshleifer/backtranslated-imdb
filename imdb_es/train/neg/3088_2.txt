1. The aliens look like stuffed animals and hand puppets, while they have arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. The aliens dominated intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to push an open vault door to open it, but they can open a door that is kept closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. The Old Security Guards know how to get a C4, and they are just waiting for the right moment to use it, for example, when they are suddenly fired without an explainable reason. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, the US Army training camp. In the 1980s, it involved several sessions of "combat with garden tools", including the spin of the death pirouette. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your prudish girlfriend, you have to "save the world ... err ... the neighborhood" of the aliens. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are whores, either openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. The nightclubs seem like bad diners. <br /> <br /> 8. The "scummy" waitresses are doubling as dancers for The Fontanelles (how did they hear about this?) that only bad dance moves from the 60s can do. <br /> <br /> 9. Private soldiers secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The grenades apparently have a setting for "flash-bang". <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on his arms. <br /> <br /> 12. Apparently, the sergeants of the US Army General Staff are always in the area and do nothing about the aliens in the area. Apparently, foreigners always "return home", which means going back to the vault where they were without a key. <br /> <br /> 14. The aliens are attracted by the bright lights, which apparently means that in the Los Angeles area it could be assumed that the protagonist's house is the most enlightened thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the public claim more. <br /> <br /> 16. The trucks of the 1980s apparently have horrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 18. The horror is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. It is assumed that parodies and tributes are produced in this film. <br /> <br /> 20. This film cures insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools make noises with the electronic keyboard every time they are used, not just in fights (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this). <br /> <br /> The truth is that this movie went wrong. . Period. There is not much meat in the bone, nor does anything really good. Even the average. It's just bad. However, I've seen much worse things, and the scene of the rake fight is pure gold comedy, intentional or otherwise. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than this. At least the movie was never taken seriously.
