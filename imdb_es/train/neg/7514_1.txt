A low-budget effort from Texas that at least was filmed well, but that's a bit of comfort. Bad acting, or, should I say, excessive acting, a pretty loose story that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It seems that a group of young people are setting up a haunted house for Halloween, which takes place every year, but this year things are different. It has an extensive lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills the empty spaces, of which there are many. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
