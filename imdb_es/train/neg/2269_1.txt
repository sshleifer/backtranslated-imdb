We are going to make a film about an interview program that already exists and basically we have everything that happens in the program! Well, if that idea does not intrigue you, which you should not, stay away from the master of ceremonies. I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and being able to sit through this mess of a movie. I suppose Jerry Springer does not play alone as shown in the cheap accessories for his show (yes, it seems even cheaper than the real Jerry Springer show) and he is only known as Jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter who lives with her mother and decides to start sleeping with her mother's boyfriend. So the mother's bright idea is to call the jerry springer show and do it with her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park)? Meanwhile, in another part of America, a woman finds her man cheating with her friend in bed together. So, of course, call America's therapist Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the movie, but even thinking about the movie now is giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, seems totally unattractive in the movie. And you remember Michael Dudikoff, the karate teacher of the series of American ninjas? Well, take a look now like a white trash drunk. The thing is that it really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it "get in touch with your character". But if your idea of ​​fun is to see Jerry Springer sing a country song about his own show or guys who hook up with transvestites ... well ... ONLY MORE SHOWS THE SHOW INSTEAD! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay out of this movie.
