A great opportunity for an Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the verge of stardom. It could have been a decent movie if he had dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how he is torturing his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. The hero of John Livien's suicidal mother was John Lennon and she wanted him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on the musical brilliance of John Lennon, and on his wonderful ability to show himself to others to learn something about his own life, he showed that Lennon's legacy was that of a confused and drugged soul, which should be seen as a God. man. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by another person who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded? John Lennon gave the world so much with his music and honesty, and I was disgusted to see another disturbed person, like the main character in this film obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans the opportunity to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie chose to use that site for the killer to attempt suicide. I found it so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died of a brutal and senseless death, and seeing so much violence near this site felt like a new wound for any Lennon fan. It completely ruined the movie for me. It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and do not be reminded of his cruel murder with this irresponsible film.
