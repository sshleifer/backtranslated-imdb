It has a very bad performance. Bad lines of history. Bad characters You should never see this show if you see it on. TURN IT OFF. Or you'll be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been transmitted. It's not great. You should never see it. NEVER NEVER NEVER. So now, if you ever want to see this show, please do not do it. Turn to the CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, those are much better family programs. So believe me in this, I've seen it before. and it's honestly, and I mean honestly, the worst show I've seen, and I've seen a lot of television. So do me a favor, and never see this show.
