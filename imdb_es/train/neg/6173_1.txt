This film is a flagrant attempt by the left in Hollywood to present the Reagan administration as incompetent and clumsy. It is possible that some mistakes were made at the time of the crisis, but I am sure not to the extent that is described in this film. My first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. Apparently there are many others.
