In fact, some time ago I retired from Asian horror movies after I got tired of seeing the same ghostly garbage. However, lately I have devoted more and more to the exploitation films, so I decided to give them another chance. My first point of contact was the highly qualified director Takashi Miike 'Visitor Q'. I had already seen Audition, and although I did not like it very much, I consider it one of the best modern horror films in Asia. So, I entered into this with sensible expectations; And unfortunately, only boredom was found. I guess this movie is really smart and it crossed my mind, but for me what it seemed was just a collection of violent and unpleasant scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I am concerned; all Miike has done here is make a movie; any intelligence that surrounds it has been implemented by pretentious fanatics, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache started in about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it did not subside until the movie finally ended; At least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Do not get me wrong, I am not against the violence in movies and, in fact, I am actively looking for the most famous films; But while this can be violent, it is also useless and boring and I did not get any pleasure. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope that this is the last time I will come into contact with one of his films.
