The crater lake of a meteor hit (hence our title), awakening a Plesiosaurus, which proceeds to sting the population of Hick (in California, the capital of Hick of the world). <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster", which somehow managed to escape from MST3K. With grid action, a decent stop-motion beast, and more, this is a terrible piece of the low-budget monster / farm campaign of 1970. <br /> <br /> While the movie is guilty of many Crimes, the biggest is Arnie and Mitch, two hateful rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They fight, fight to find "banjo music", eat with women's eyes and act as pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad that they should be considered a crime against humanity.
