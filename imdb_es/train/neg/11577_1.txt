The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers of Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (previous version), Cameron DÃ­az Try to get out of the frame as fast as you can (successfully), do not ask for Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their shame with these fucking things. It offers an endless dialogue, without meaning and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a charming and extensive Frank Lloyd Wright mansion. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not do the location justice.
