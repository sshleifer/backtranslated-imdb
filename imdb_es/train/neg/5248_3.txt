"Die Sieger" was highly recommended as one of the few good action movies made in Germany. I saw it last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If that is supposed to be "the last and best hope" to entertain and challenge German action movies, well, not much remains. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" tries to be sexy, bold and furious, but it's nothing like that. The characters are made of wood and stereotypes, and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much), they act against their nature. That makes it difficult, almost impossible for me to follow them or even identify with them. <br /> <br /> More than anything, I think the movie is very bad. There is not a single character in whom I believe. Maybe the top officer of the SWAT unit, but that's it. Those people who try to look like or act like special units, like elite policemen, do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad after all. But I think it's wrong said. You do not know the bad guy at all, for example. And when after a "very dark" show, Karl Simon (the good guy) asks his dead opponent "why? ... for what?" I asked myself that same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I hope not, I think Germany can do better, even with action movies.
