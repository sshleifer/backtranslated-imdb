It really shows that exaggeration is not everything. It shows by and so he is an actor of shit abhishek and he is only getting movies for his father and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is a shit and useless and the new kid is a joke. The protagonist is a waste of actor. A film so pathetic of a director so revered and such a big industry. With films as such, I have decreased the amount of Bollywood movies that I see. <br /> <br /> RGV has been doing very bad movies for a while. It's time to get different actors. Hrithek someone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol to return. Every other main lady is a half-naked wants. Pffffft.
