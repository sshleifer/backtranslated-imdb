A warship is sinking ... Its survivors, hanging from a nearby life raft, sit there doing nothing while we get into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Coward is the Only one that you noticed during the credits, everything that is cinematographic is due to Lean. And in technical terms, it's very good. David Lean has just KNOWN the movies from the first moment. There are many moments in which the studied dialogue of Coward takes a second seat and the visual sense of Lean occupies a central place. Try to get the soldiers off the ship near the end, and the whole scene; the follow-up song to the song of the hymn, the scene in which we are inside a house that is bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've seen in my life. It is totally made of wood, without showing emotion, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he is not really listening to what the other artist is saying, he is just waiting for them to finish so he can run out of his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> It's episodic, a bit repetitive, and flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story to go forward, they only offer general information about the characters. Still, it's an interesting movie that's worth watching, and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's definitely a propaganda movie, but it's also a showcase of Lean's editing skills: it's all about how the pieces come together.
