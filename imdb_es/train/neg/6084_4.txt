It is possible that A Man Called Sledge has done irreparable damage to the floor of the cutting room. Maybe someone will demand a director cut some day, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to take advantage of the western spaghetti market and, in doing so, he attracted a lot of Americans to fill the cast. outside. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And, of course, we have Vic Morrow, who wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Garner is always chosen as friendly rogues because he is very good at interpreting them. But he has played seriously and has done well in films like The Children's Hour and The Gun Time. You can and have separated from your usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge can not be considered one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the lead role as Luther Sledge's famous outlaw with a big price on his head. After his partner Tony Young dies in a room and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood-style measures, John Marley follows him from the living room. <br /> <br /> Marley spent some time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems that the gold shipments are put under lock and key there in a rest stop for people who transport things in a regular race. Garner gathers his band for a robbery. <br /> <br /> This is where the movie comes out of the wall. Typically, theft movies show the protagonists in a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon that other critics cited. But in this case, Garner decides to break into prison as a prisoner of the false US marshal. UU Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak, at which time he will steal the gold. <br /> <br /> That was too much to swallow. If taking gold was so easy, it should have been done much earlier. But I will say that for those who like the blood and the entrails of the Italian westerns, during that recess in prison there is enough for three films. <br /> <br /> That's not all, of course the outlaws are fighting and we have another gore fest before the movie ends. But by then, the whole movie has lost much coherence. <br /> <br /> The great film singer of the thirties Allan Jones appears in the credits. But for my life I can not find it in the movie. Maybe a choir from the Donkey Serenade could have improved this. <br /> <br /> I could not have done any harm.
