Yikes made this movie all at once. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I thought this could not be so bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He should have done this because he was bored and needed the money. The characters were supposed to be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something good about this, I can not, except that Walken did a good job with a wooden character. Find something to read, or watch the discovery, never see this movie.
