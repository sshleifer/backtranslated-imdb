I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (it seems that many critics say the same thing as AGE 13) with a group of friends from school. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film, and we fell in love with the typical commercials that tell us that this was a great comedy. We suffered for about 45 minutes, and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from the ability that Billy Crystal had to make us laugh, we did not laugh. I came across this review by accident, and I decided to register only to tell the rest of the world what a waste of film this was. Now, if you rent this, you deserve what you get, YOU'VE BEEN NOTICE!
