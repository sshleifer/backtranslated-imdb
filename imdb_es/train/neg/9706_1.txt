... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal scale of 1-10. I have attended movies since 1952 and I have seen more than 1000 in the theater (I do not rate the movies that I see only on TV). This is the ONLY movie that I have rated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the children seemed terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me about this site (I was surprised that the film obtained a general rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animation of the dinosaurs looked like an amateur at that time. (and it's even worse in retrospect), the acting (particularly by Sean Young) is atrocious and the storyline is just plain silly. <br /> <br />
