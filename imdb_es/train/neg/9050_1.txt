I saw this film in its entirety in the 60s and 70s, yes, it is appalling, and could be the progenitor of the popular series "Faces of death" in the 80s and 90s. Considering the state of the so-called "education" of the driver "these days, this should be required so that everyone is prepared to learn to drive. When you see a violent death in all its blood and horror, certainly (if you have any sensitivity) you get a more real perspective on the responsibilities necessary to drive safely, which can make an instant of thoughtlessness or lack of attention to the steering wheel. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s, and at one point I was assigned a security class. I found this movie in the company's library, I showed it in the session, several people became physically ill and had to leave the room. Incredibly, most of them later said "I never knew that a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, and another, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I just wish I had found a copy when my children attended the "driving school" in high school!
