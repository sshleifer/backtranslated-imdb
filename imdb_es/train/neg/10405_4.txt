The fourth feature of "Tremors" goes back in time, until the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which at that time was "Rejection, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the dreadful "Graboids." Some of the characters in the current "Tremors" movies have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. The most obvious is the always regressive Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; So, he hired gunman Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot some "Dragons of the Earth." <br /> <br /> This requires a little time to get used to, as it is in the distant past. . It's like a western with miniature versions of the monster from the original movie "Graboids". These "Dirt Dragons" tamers are not as terrifying as their "Tremors" (1990). Consequently, in this film, the characters spend a lot of time on the floor, which would not have happened in the original movie. And it was strange that the citizens abandoned the fight so quickly, when Gross decided to temporarily leave the city. Why so helpless? Why Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately gathered people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
