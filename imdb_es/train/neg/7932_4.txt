Oh dear, what a disappointment. I've been watching old westerns on British television for decades, and I was not aware of this until its presentation yesterday: most of the other Scott Westerns appear every few years and it's usually worth seeing them again. <br /> <br /> The rich color and the outdoor games were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I wanted to turn it off, and finally I did, halfway, something I almost never do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusually greasy as he enchanted the girls, his two companions were annoying and so was the Mexican. bandit kid And I have the feeling that the army uniforms were about 20 years too modern, not that this has bothered the makers of many other westerns. <br /> <br /> Maybe it got better in the second half, but I could not. bother to wait and see.
