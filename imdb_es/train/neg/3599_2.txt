Umm ... I was quite surprised that someone really gave high marks to this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this movie only shows the extent of her "talent". The plot of the film was weak ... I bet that the imbecile that came up with this concept was a perverted look tom. If there is something good in this movie, I would say that it is the daughter of Tommy Chong, just because of the fact that she is his daughter ... and then there is the masculine protagonist of Soap-Opera, who has a good appearance, he does attractive. , but stop helping your dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? In how many more ways can you just say "This movie sucks"?
