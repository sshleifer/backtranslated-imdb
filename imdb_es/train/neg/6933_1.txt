In relation to other Columbo films, this can only be described as 1 (horrible). Seriously, I do not understand what the other critics have seen in this terrible shock of a movie. It was only through the morbid fascination that I continued to observe him, to see what strange or inept decision the director would make next. <br /> <br /> Another critic suggested that it was Falk's only exit as a director because it interfered with his performance. paper. In fact, I think the real reason lies with the studio bosses, who must have been horrified to see what they had done with their money. It's a miracle that they did not kill him.
