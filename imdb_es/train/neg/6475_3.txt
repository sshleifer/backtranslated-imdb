Although I still have to review the movie in about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as it was. Having loved the original Little Mermaid, and having been obsessed with child sirens, I decided to take the time to sit down and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If he does not have the director and the original actors at hand ... he's just looking for his horn to move. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with an Ariel and her daughter a little older, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the team sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great at singing and dancing numbers, but in reality, that's what made Eric my favorite prince. He was quiet, collected and a true gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. DO NOT. TO SING. <br /> <br /> And then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget the chills that ran through our thorns every time Ursula slid on the screen, terrorizing Ariel and the public around the world? Unfortunately, that gene was not transmitted to his apparently useless sister, Morgana. Nothing was ever said about Morgana in the first movie; she just comes out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how nice. The younger sister is angry and, instead of chasing the trident, decides to kidnap a one-month-old baby. Cheat me. <br /> <br /> Besides being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was simply very unorthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same henchmen (which, by the way, did not scare anyone, I had a three-year-old girl in my lap when I saw this movie, and she laughed hysterically). It had no purpose to be there. ; I wish I had seen Mom be the villain. I'm sure she would have done a better job than little Miss Tish there. <br /> <br /> King Triton did not have the respect he had earned from me in the first movie, and he does not even get I started with Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but loving father in the first film, and in the second, it is almost as if he had lost the will to put fear into the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once it was a comic relief that made everyone laugh with their 'hopper hopper' (yes, I admit it, from time to time I called my fork a hopper hopper). In this movie, Scuttle is almost forgotten. A secondary character even in the first, at least added something to the film. It was rich with a flavor that the others did not have, and in the aftermath, they almost took it away completely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as disturbing as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little big fish, who becomes a father and has a crowd of very annoying children. It is fat, and it is insipid, and it seems that it is going to stretch at any time. <br /> <br /> The walruses and penguins were not necessary, and after a while, you just start to resent them all. Especially Melody, who has no depth to her at all. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm throwing myself out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love Your originals so much.
