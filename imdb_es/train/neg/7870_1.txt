The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The worst first sequel to a really good movie". In LV2 everyone screams, when a gag does not work first, it repeats another 5 times with a vague hope that eventually it becomes funny. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody must be inventive. If you loved the LV1, do not see this movie, just see the LV1 again.
