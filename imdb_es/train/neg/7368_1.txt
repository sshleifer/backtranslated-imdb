I had the misfortune to lose 10 pounds buying the new SS movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief by watching movies like this one. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark night on the couch watching a loud photo shoot at sunset is perfect for a single alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking that I would see great martial arts and I would record them. <br /> <br /> I made hell. Segal is old and inflated, the plot was ridiculous even by the standards of the SS and, to top it off, Segal's performance (as it was to begin with) is exceptionally serious. So serious, in fact, that half of his voice was dubbed by a man who did not sound ANYTHING LIKE HIM. O SS can not act anymore (a moot point) of the crew was so terrible in their jobs that they could not record the sound correctly. The voice would move back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man who voices off for Honda announcements! <br /> <br /> The argument is not the problem because most action movies have the same premise as this one. nothing new there. The usual mix of characters that will die horribly like cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to be dragged. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, as you would avoid walking in front of a high-speed train or a dose of avian H5N1. flu. <br /> <br /> Total garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This has been a public health warning.
