"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the career of director of the German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many felt it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it perfectly clear; Wenders not only has lost it, but he has also become a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> One could argue that the "moment you lose it" comes for all directors, but Wenders The case is extreme. It's as if I completely forgot everything I knew about cinema and started over, just to get sloppy results. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie does not deserve your time.
