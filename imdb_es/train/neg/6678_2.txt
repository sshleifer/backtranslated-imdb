This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the high seas. <br /> <br /> The story line is more or less the same but it is contemporary. Govinda plays an intelligent guy who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the friend of the college of the wife who does him the same favor. Apparently, they try to catch others while the real husband and wife try to stumble in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the trip, Govinda confuses another girl with Sanjiv's wife and the spy while they fall in love with the dazzling Rani. <br /> <br /> The lever plays a double role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are pitted against each other by the belligerent couple. <br /> <br /> It's a poor attempt to copy the original classics and the songs are pretty terrible. The comedy is slap-stick and it will not make you laugh too much.
