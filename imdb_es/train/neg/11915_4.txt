This obvious pilot for a television series not presented presents the young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that should be used when a demon turned into a man is freed from the world. The CGI is even for a TV job, and Appleby is fine as an amnesiac but hard to swallow like a superhero. The well-known character of television, Richard Burgi, is the mentor of Appleby's, but he can not do anything to raise this dreck above the mediocre level. From the beginning, we see too much of the cartoon flying demon, a bad sign. Also, the scenes in which Burgi is training Appleby for battle are really ridiculous. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
