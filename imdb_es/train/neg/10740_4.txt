This movie starts with a certain amount of promise; but, in my opinion, it starts to get lost when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. For this well-intentioned stranger to begin fixing her car while she is absent, making a phone call is quite unlikely, but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help her get back on track for her family's life. Writers who start by coincidence are warned against using them in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie at the best of times. The art direction could have been much better, as cinematography could have been. The performance was good, and so was the song of Eva van der Gucht.
