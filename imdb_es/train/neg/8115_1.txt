This movie was the most horrible movie viewing experience I have had to endure, and what is worse is the fact that I had to watch it, and I did not have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school. It is true that the story was decent ... but I found the performance terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her, I doubt she could have seen the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling" I shudder! I almost hit a customer the other day because they said "that". It made me remember one of the worst hours and a half of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if this has offended anyone, I only express my opinion)
