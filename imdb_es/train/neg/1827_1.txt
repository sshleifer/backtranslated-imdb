Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, you can only hope for the best. However, with "Envy", nobody could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers in a sandpaper factory. Both are making a decent living, but since Tim has a better job performance, he can pay more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always comes with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with an idea for an aerosol can that makes the dog poop disappear (Yes, really). When falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think that the idea will ever work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, titled "va-poo-rize" (again, seriously), ends up making millions. He likes to spend his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and elegant desserts. Tim begins to feel envious of Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but still it is horrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances of all the actors. Then, again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this disaster. Not even the great Christoper Walken, who plays a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie fun. The movie is bad from the beginning and it just keeps getting worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like shit (it's not a play on words) * you want to see Jack Black in a white suit <br /> <br /> I mean, avoid this movie at all costs, but especially avoid if: * you are offended by the bathroom humor * love animals
