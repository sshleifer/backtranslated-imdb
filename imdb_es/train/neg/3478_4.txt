Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to feel alone this Christmas. Drew is not just a millionaire; but also hateful and guilty of being very great. Drew returns to the house where he grew up and offers the family living there, the Valco's, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during the holiday season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but he is greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about it, but learns that she likes to have Drew ... it is not exactly the same feeling with her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but that also has room for change . Drew's girlfriend, Missy (Jennifer Morrison) traces Drew and wants her parents to meet her family. Genuine fun is in store when a happy Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is funny, although strange.
