This movie was terrible. The plot was bad, the performance was bad, the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to take my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie again. The balloon scene was stupid, the mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack was crap, I did not see chemistry between the two tracks, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local cameos "celebrities" ... the most notorious was Del "Voy to drive As fast as I want ... "computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even ruined it. This film helps create a long line of mediocre efforts to integrate LDS beliefs in Hollywood. THAT IS TO SAY. The RM, the ball of the Church, etc., etc. I resign to see this movie and instead, runs headfirst against a brick wall. You'll be more entertaining than watching this poor excuse for a show.
