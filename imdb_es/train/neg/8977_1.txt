A country singer nicknamed "Big T" (seriously, that's what they call her) risks her incipient musical career and her life by falling in the company of a seedy drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. Meanwhile, there is music in abundance, since Parton, with his fluent vocal talent, sings song after song (at least half a dozen of them on Texas). Get away from this mess and review it in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
