I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when she first appeared in 1970. At that time I was 20 years old and very healthy, she loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. Besides that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel on which it was based and I thought it was very funny. I saw the movie on a local drive-in and almost halfway there, I was tempted to turn on the engine of my car so that I might die of poisoning by monoxide and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. He was not "smart" or "modern", he was rude and careless. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Mae West casting was one of the worst casting choices in film history. As one critic here said, his role had nothing to do with the movie or the book. His character in the book is sexually beaten by the young stallion, which he would never do for the legendary Mrs. West. Oh no, the plot has changed, so she hits him sexually, very credibly of a 77 year old woman who looks every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
