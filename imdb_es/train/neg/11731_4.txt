As far as I'm concerned, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version, everything is a macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me of the Nazis falling in love; Who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this we have John Gilbert and his cousin, the Prince, lusting for this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, who has a modern hairstyle and an implausible feminist way that she threw me over and over again. I like my light and beautiful romances, with slow accumulations; Not rough and sadistic like this one. And come on, those bee-stung lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see a live performance of the show if you want to have a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz Lehar's original operetta. If that fails, wait for TCM to show the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier It is much better.
