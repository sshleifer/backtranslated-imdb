I am a Catholic, taught in parish primary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but I would not consider myself a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe in certain things or act in certain ways just because the church tells me. <br /> <br /> So, back for the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as an incarnation of a female religious figure. There is no comedy in that and the satire is not well done because of the excessive performance of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play, but if it was very different from these movies, then it can be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the gun could be false and that the first shot was a plan by the female protagonist of The Four Past Pupils as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fanaticism of Sister Mary. But it turns out that the bullets were real and the story has a tragedy ... the tragedy of the loss of lives (in addition to the two former students ... the lives of the aborted babies, the lives of the students' mothers), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over the love of people, the tragedy of organized religion that replaces true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
