Well, where do I start my story? Tonight I went to this movie with some friends who did not know more than the Actors who were in it, and that was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I realized within the first 20 minutes. What a bad decision I had made to go out watching this movie. The plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have been more plastic. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been done much faster ... like they went on for no particular reason. Very poor edition. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
