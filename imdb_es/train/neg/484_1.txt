I disliked this movie. No, it was not because of the graphic sex scenes, but because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not have much truth about her and her art. It shows a work of art that she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she entered as a testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood this about the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He raped Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false accusations of rape to prevent her from suffering while torturing her. According to the transcripts of violations, he went on to state that he never met Artemisia (also known with whom he had sex) while she states over and over again, "It's true." <br /> <br /> I encourage all of you to go out and find the real Artemis and discover what it is really about. Do not base all your knowledge on this fiction movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisa really has an interesting story behind her and an incredible art work. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but discover the true story of Artemis.
