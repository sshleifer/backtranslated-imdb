In fact, I am surprised by the amount of good grades obtained by this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary. Now, I respect the opinion and the faith of the boy, I myself am not, in this state, a believer of the Christian doctrine taught. However, anti-Christian propaganda is something different. <br /> <br /> This film has valid points, but they are very few and they are represented in a very skewed context. I'm not recommending against seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is really an opportunity more than the one that the director gives to the Christian teachings. Instead of an inquisitive focus on the subject, it seems a personal revenge in the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also distorts Christians most of the time as incredibly na√Øve or fundamentalist, without intermediate moderation. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes from films of the Passion of Christ without permission, establishes an interview with the director of his Old School and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I found that the director was the most realistic person and thought that his attitude was fully justified. I also doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted or told the purpose of the investigation before the interview. <br /> <br /> That said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be Here are some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way in which all this thought is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and terribly biased.
