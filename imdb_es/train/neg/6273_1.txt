This was a beautiful movie until the end. The end was simply a more despicable effort to immaculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who finally gave up her power and control over the relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car, as they walked away at the end after he had to beg and beg him to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.
