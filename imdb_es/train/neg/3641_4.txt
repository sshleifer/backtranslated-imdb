Summary: According to legend, the Valkyrie Brunhilda challenged Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a pure-hearted warrior can go through the flames, free Brunhilda and free her from Odin's claim, and have her for him. Now, the war is brewing in the Nordic lands, and the King needs an alliance with the Berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors claimed by the Valkyries of Odin, who yearn for war, blood and flesh, and therefore, pariahs, but superior in battle. The leader of the Berserkers is a despised son of the King, Boar, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the King is victorious in battle, he refuses to give up his only remaining son, breaking his oath to Boar, betraying and killing him. The boar is saved only by the call of Barek to Odin. But this is just the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to begin now, a millennium later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I was hoping that this would be a movie based It has been made a bit of Viking film, very little quality about Viking. It also started very well, with long ships and detailed armor, pleasant and suitable landscapes and a good battle. <br /> <br /> The foundation of Aesir's myths is thin and I find it very corrupt. Odin is much more vindictive, spiteful and absent than I remember him in school, and the Valkyries have turned into some vampire demons. I'm not an expert, but that seems totally wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal error of this movie is to move the time setting from the original time period to today. If the two brothers had fought at the right time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better. Now the configuration, suddenly changes to the current Stockholm. Still, Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers for Brunhilda and Barek, which offers silly scenes when armored and painted berserkers fight with Barek between industries. Beautiful mountains and forests have been changed by cement. And when I was allowed to focus on individual fights, instead of massive battles like in the beginning, I quickly saw that the fights and the skills of the actors are slow and awkward. <br /> <br /> The end result is a thin story, sometimes it's hard to follow and other times it's just silly, and the only thing that could save it, the action, is based on slow, clumsy and clumsy sword fights . It is based very little on the myth of Aesir or the Viking tradition. Therefore, both the story and the action fail, and the movie is simply bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, like a Swede, this movie is a bit confusing. Allegedly filmed in its entirety in South Africa, it still contains some Swedish family signs, license plates and what appears to be a real police car. However, the effort is poor and only goes so far as to really establish it in Sweden. No name is Swedish (maybe with Anya as an exception), no family setting is Swedish, (supposedly) they talk a little (old?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniforms, both police and medical, clearly are not Swedish. If they were not even going to try to do it correctly, and really give themselves the illusion that it is set in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
