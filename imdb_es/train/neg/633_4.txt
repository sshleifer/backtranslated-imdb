Good Earth follows the life of a slave and a poor peasant in China. The film is based on Pearl S. Buck's novel. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to choose the Anglos in the main roles. Walter Connolly is laughable like the father of the farmer. He has a strong American accent, like most of the leading actors, who could not bear to hear him speak. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Hollywood has not been able to overcome its racist beliefs to drive Asians out. in the main roles. Taking the Anglos and making them look like the Chinese is similar to the Anglos who wear shoe polishers on their faces to play African Americans.
