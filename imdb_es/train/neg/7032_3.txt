When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to investigate the death of her brother, she begins to suspect something more sinister than the "natural causes". The closer he gets to the truth, the more threatening becomes his sister-in-law, Fiona (Line Helga) and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do whatever is necessary to stop their noisy movements. <br /> <br /> If you like satanic-themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is full of a lot of nudity and soft sex rituals. A particular scene involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sordidness in the world can not save Black Candles. Most of the movie is total boredom. Apart from the scene that I have already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not attractive. The action is irregular at best. Even the favorite genre Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot really does not matter. Its main function seems to be to keep the chain of boring sex scenes together. I'm just familiar with another film directed by José Ramón Larraz. Compared to his Daughters of Darkness who mix eroticism and horror masterfully, Black Candles becomes an amateur. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
