I'm being generous giving this film 2 stars. The phrase "have you seen the Wizard of Oz" was the best thing for me? With a terrible writing and acting like those shown in this film, it's no wonder so many of them are cheated by worthless television shows. Do yourself a favor and leave the house and play a royal baseball game, you'll be glad you did!
