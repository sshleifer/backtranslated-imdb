Ulysses is a literature teacher who arrives in a coastal town. There, he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will begin a torrid romance that will end in the tragic death of Ulysses at sea. Some years later, Martina has married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a quiet and happy life surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulysses will make his passion rise and act without thinking about the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film are sexual acts that, while being filmed, are quite exhausting, since we want to see more development of the story. It's just a bad movie by Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, no arguments and stupid characters everywhere.
