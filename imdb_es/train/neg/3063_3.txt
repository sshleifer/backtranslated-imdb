The images that generally glorify a hero have a meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you really feel sympathy for them despite their bad deeds. Why? They were two people trapped in depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no substance. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon emerges as a popular hero. Why? He rushes along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his injured wife has been drinking. Nobody bothers to understand why he is trying to run away from everyone. Worse, when he realizes he is not a red-collar terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him while trying to save his asses. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley co-stars as a Radio emcee based on the story in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely incredible.
