This movie makes me think that the others I've seen with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I saw in a movie that pretends to be something more than a "b" movie. The performance was so ridiculous that not even the memories of Combs' past triumphs were enough to save her. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am very upset to have paid the prices of Blockbuster for this garbage. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and, frankly, something that the films of these poor people should warn him about. Avoid this movie no matter what happens.
