As a Hammer finalist, I feared the moment I would have to muster the courage to watch this movie and the next one, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen the movie One the Buses and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of all the horrible comedy that haunted the screens of British television in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and I enjoyed some situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I could not swear at any time in the trilogy if he says his motto: "I'll make you a steward." <br /> <br /> Having seen Holiday on the Buses, the jokes were starting to work. wear and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in which the second film made is the best (although this is probably the only way they could be compared). <br /> <br /> Only the people who would like to see this movie are probably the fans of the TV series, who will definitely enjoy it, and the Hammer finalists like me. I would tell the finalists that this movie is not so bad and I can certainly think of Hammer's worst comedies.
