Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns", the season one episode of John Carpenter in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and the time constraints assigned to it. However, with "Pro-Life", low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is a solid direction as always Carpenter, but there is a quality in writing and all the production itself that gives the feeling that it was made in a total and complete race. The script is not always clear, the message is blurry and the story is full of plot holes once you look back. Maybe if Carpenter had rewritten the script, it could have been an episode that was worth it. Instead, it's a disaster that only Carpenter fans will find the slightest pleasure. Definitely, the worst that Carpenter has done. 2/10
