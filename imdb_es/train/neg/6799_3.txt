['Do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, this movie resembles a movie starring Doris Day in 1956, title, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was a stewardess, stewardess, in those days, landed the aircraft after her husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing, than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 planes, I used to be a flight attendant. As I said, do not expect much from this movie, it was done with a cheap budget. The producers were too cheap to use an airplane with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that several films have used. The only one written on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.']
