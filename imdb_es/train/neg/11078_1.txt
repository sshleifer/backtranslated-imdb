Honestly, where can I start? This was a low budget movie, it acted HORRIBLY, it was so cheesy that it made us burst with laughter for how completely retarded it was. the sword fighting scenes were not even sword fights, they were playing with some plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try to make it look like they were fighting. One day, my family and I were in the mood for a really good action movie, so we decided to go to the store to find one, and there was the movie The Sawtooth Island. I mean it looked so good, but when we saw it at home I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the plot of the movie, the story board, the script, etc., was a lot of garbage that I do not even know why the director and the producer even wasted their time doing it ! But if you run into this movie ... Do not get it !!!!!
