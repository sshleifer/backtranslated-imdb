This movie is stale, and it loses its mark. It is very far compared to the 89 Batman that tries to copy. That singer, what's her name can not act, and we see why her movie company died? Observe how this movie died at the box office, nobody sees it on television either. My uncle and my dad were waiting for Batman, and the printing of the movies is more like Cop Rock. Not worth renting 3/10
