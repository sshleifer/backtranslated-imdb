There is so much wrong with this abysmal wet little fart of a movie that it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's a very frightening scary movie, even by American standards. The dialogue is clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is boring and the little story there is neither coherent nor remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in order: Bald loser Chico (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who does not do anything heroic in absolute), Brave Little Kid (with a mile-wide homicide streak) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (stronger than brains). These guys are facing an ongoing fight with Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of evil little metal orbs that are thrown around by threatening people. If given the opportunity, they perform impromptu brain surgeries on those who do not have the mental acuity to duck when attacked. Booh! Actually, one of them is being chased by a good ghost (but, again, it could be a deceptive ghost) that seems to try to help our Brave Smugglers to retrieve their kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> No background of characters. Or even an introduction to any of the characters. Start with some summary of the end of the previous movie, but this does not explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care whether they live or die. Consequently, you do not. The only point of interest becomes any splash effect. And there's not enough of them to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Of interest / potential fun are the three Raider Punks, as stupid as they are evil, that threaten Our Heroes. But they do not get much screen time. They are released almost immediately. Then they are buried (why someone should take the time is beyond me), then appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Only to reactivate, literally, in a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie seems to consist mainly of the appearance and disappearance of Caspar the Friendly Ghost, driving in search of places, and Balding Loser, who tries to score some. Bad Black Bitch Booty, using collection lines that would embarrass a teenager with mental retardation. There are no dice there; not even a little free sex could have saved this movie, so it's good that there never is any. <br /> <br /> The head of the children, called the tall man, can not scare anyone older than 3 years; howls "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough It is not explained why he, with his amazing telekinetic powers and his strange strength in the upper body, does not crush our heroes like insects. Instead, he delegates the work to his inept, retarded little henchmen, who never manage to kill anyone before being shot into hell. <br /> <br /> For viewers who like masterpieces such as "Friday the 13th, part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college" I could find some entertainment The rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will be bored with our skulls.
