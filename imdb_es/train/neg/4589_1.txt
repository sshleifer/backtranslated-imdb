Remember the chain smoking pipeline exposed in 60 minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people reviewed this film without consulting the good faith of the filmmakers. Producers have been using fake word-of-mouth promotions with great success without revealing the financial and philosophical underpinnings of this piece of marketing. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, control of the new era and nonsense, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not crazy, so you will give him a lot of your money. If you can walk on tiptoe through Ramtha's website without howling in disbelief, then you may think that the dollars you threw in this crazy infomercial were spent well. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
