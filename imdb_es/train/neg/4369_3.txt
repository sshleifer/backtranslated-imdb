*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British-made thriller released in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who has to abandon his investigation because his funds have run out. Karloff is forced to retire to France and begin a medical practice. He is proposed by a deceptive woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows that Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff accepts the proposal and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. All the time, the wife is walking around the city with the local playboy is not good. Karloff finally injects poison into the old geyser and he starts. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and discovers that the will has been changed. When he passes the beans to his wife, she goes crazy and even bites the son's hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse has lost the hiccup that Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff discovers that he is not receiving money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the hiccup lost. The analysis shows the poison, but not just in time when Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> To summarize the story, the nurse escapes, receives the police and manages to save the child who is about to receive the injection. by Karloff. Karloff, on the other hand, injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did in Los Comandos del Diablo and the man who lived again. However, it is peculiar to see him walking stiff and slightly stooped. We never find out why he is walking like this. I suspect that the director thought he did it more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the wife of two times comments something terrible. She has a French accent. Even though she behaves badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her for her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A bit below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the VHS copy of Sinister Cinema, the audio is a bit choppy.
