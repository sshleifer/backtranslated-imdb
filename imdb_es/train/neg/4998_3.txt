This is one of the best reality shows I've ever seen. We can watch the concerts, we can see Britney's life, I love the five episodes. Britney and the program's themes always surprised me. I think some people do not see it at all. We can be a great person. She is really fun and gentle, loves her fans and we can see how she loves her job. I just do not give it a 10 because K-fed is a jerk who does not seem to like Britney at all. They do a second season of this great show because it shows some people what Britney really is like. Go away, Britney, you are the best and you will never leave our hearts.
