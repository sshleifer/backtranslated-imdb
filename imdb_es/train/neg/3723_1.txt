The sects that take advantage of this film are well known for their claim to take the "message" of the Bible without any alteration or extra-biblical influence. The existence of this film is due solely to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the branch of Christianity born again insinuated in the seventies, simply look for the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cults and sects. It's faster than sitting through this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, uneven sound quality and a script that could easily have been written by Jack T. Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the Gospel scene). You really can not put this in the "so bad that is good" category, so your only audience are those who have a collection of brochures looking to expand or extremely paranoid.
