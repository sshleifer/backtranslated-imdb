This movie has some things in its favor from the beginning. Having Dani Filth as the lead actor will automatically make some people like this movie. It's true that I love Cradle of Filth and I listened to the soundtrack of this movie long before I saw it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes him a great leader. The independent filming style of the film is ideal for the chilling factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. Being low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways in which people died were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now to the cons. There is very little talk throughout this movie, which does very little for the development of the character. It is difficult to fear for the lives of loose and static characters. When talked a bit, the F pump was abundant, appearing in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that a preadolescent child wrote this and it was considered great to include all the language. The story, what I could get out of it, was pretty good, although many parts are hanging and the lack of conversation leaves one wondering what is happening. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porn for people who love sex and violence, but like a porn movie trying to make a story, it just does not work well. Rent it, however, if you are a morbid person who seeks to satisfy your appetite for blood and flesh.
