Okay, the story, a simple-minded madwoman who enters a life of young girl bored to death and her little brother and wreaks havoc in their lives, is something interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (we all have something ...): execution is everything. <br /> <br /> This is what bothered me with this movie. And it bothered me a lot. The rhythm (direction, editing) was slow, the rhythm was uneven and the expected climax. We've seen those roads five, six, seven times, why? The problems of the Norton characters were seen as a child's game, not deep enough to understand their problems / soul / blast and to encourage or attack it. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a madman? The references to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and, of course, are not in favor of this movie (nor of E.N.) And, in my humble opinion, it is executed in a cowardly way at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teen lovers somewhere in Mid America. This guy should have killed the child, blamed the father, created real chaos. Or the child should have killed the father at the end, etc., but no, we have had a corny ending where the children miss the crazy, the father is bewildered about his own life and relationship with them and the madman, of course, dies. The happy dysfunctional family remains unharmed, safe and happily bored again so we can enjoy our Pop-Corn, without being disturbed. <br /> <br /> And that scene where the madman enters the movie, oh my God, he would have to think long and hard to find something more stupid than that! Do not shoot a scene like that with a hidden camera and hidden equipment. The creators of that movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you are a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas anywhere or anywhere, and you dream of having sex with a crazy man who is twice as old, then you can enjoy this movie and its "message."
