Well ... I was going to wait until the video came out to see it, and I wish I had, I could actually watch the scary movie 2 on the wire the other day, and that made me crave more of the same, what? I got an AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean, if you like the Airplane or any other Leslie Nielsen vehicle, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if you're used to the WAYANS COMEDY, then you'll be disappointed, there was so much more. Sweet eye on this that will keep young teens happy with hormones, so it was probably a blockbuster the first week it came out. I enjoyed the scary movie 2 ten times more than this fodder, and the first part 5 times more. It's strange that the best of the 3 is part 2, but I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original one ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye. But that was not worth the $ 11 that I spent to get a marriage session of this with my fianc√©. Save money and catch part 2 again on the cable until it is posted on the video tape, and then change it, do not buy it.
