What a poor image of professional police officers is shown on television to see this alleged spectacle of reality. One can only hope that the real reasonable suspicion that leads to the probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a "stop", then the "Pat Down" of the outside of one's garment, and then be able to articulate by what. The officer entered someone's pocket and recovered the contraband, he was removed from the scenes, because if it was not, the arrest in most places will be launched, in case a supervisor passes them. A report of a court order on the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the order unless the person sending the order has the original order in hand. If the operator is reading a printed copy of the computer, it is good enough for an arrest, but this does not necessarily mean that the order is still valid. Since I have not seen a CBS Dis-claimer (it's possible that I missed it), CBS could be in trouble.
