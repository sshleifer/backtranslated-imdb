It is true that the stage in Paris is great. The actors are fine. History is a work of twisted morals. Are you supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough, is it okay to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance, you somehow want less clich√© than the man who has grown bored with his wife and is willing to leave his family, and the woman who agrees to encourage him to do so. So, what if they look decent and if Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of the story is "you get what you deserve." I give it a 4, just for the potential of fast scanning through the bits of "male interest".
