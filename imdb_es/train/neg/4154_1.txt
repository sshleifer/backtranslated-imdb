Vampires vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Semi-nasty lesbian vampires and two zombies were hit by cars: special guest appearances by Bob lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, random woman with special powers and the Catholic School Short Skirt of Girl Zombie Choir. <br /> <br /> Also in the box: Warning: No plot: only the writer and the director will understand the ending or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even enjoy lesbians. This film combined all three with a vague and confusing (or nonexistent) plot, a horrible dialogue (I mean really bad) and random PEOPLE STUFF and they have nothing to do with anything (or if ... I did not know that in the world was happening). Oh, and I can not forget the green oat 'zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not even cover their Zombie hands with oats and paint). Anyway, the result was this BAD movie unbearable, if you could call it that. <br /> <br /> Was the end supposed to be meaningless? Was the vampire really a nurse and the other girl really a mental patient? Where were the vampires vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the vampires ... you really could not call any of the girls vampires? Whatever is. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're REALLY curious ... it's fine, I'll understand. Seriously, even lovers of bad movies can not stand this. It must be number 1 in the bottom 100.
