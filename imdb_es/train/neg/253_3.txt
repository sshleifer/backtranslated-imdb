The premise of the film has been explained and if you have come this far, do not make me believe that I am a film critic. Having said that, my opinion about the movie is quite low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this falls into the category of his not-so-good job along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be free. pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is an approach of high school students to the cinema. For the rest of us we will find an hour and a half of a child screaming without any real reason completely annoying (and yes, this takes us away from the movie), the rhythm of the film almost reaches levels of rigomortis, and the Acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If one is a Takashi fan, he will see it regardless of how he increases his interests. Lacks originality (see the endless story) or any development of the character of the main character in front of a conflict that is not quite superficial. <br /> <br /> As noted, this is the first film to which Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that does not mean much, since of what we expect to be Miike's personality it would spread. on the screen All we receive are some of the shots of Miike from the director of photography. <br /> <br /> The movie had the potential to be something big. The premise is not difficult to execute with wild. But this seems to have been found on the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you're just getting into Miike, you should go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film in his works as Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
