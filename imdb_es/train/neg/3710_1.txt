The king is dead, long live the king! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, The Family under the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied to the worst movie in history for so long that they looked like icons in their own right. But there is a new king ... yes ... everyone greets the new king ... "To the land". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, are so bad that they are good. Someday this could draw the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go see this ... this ... well, just trust my word. Go see it. Hail the new king!
