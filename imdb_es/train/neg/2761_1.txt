Everyone does things that they later regret. Things that they would like to be able to blame on drugs or foreign possession. Things that although seem rational at that moment, then reveal themselves as engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people it is signing the note for the new Hummer, for others it is to choose. a homicidal hitchhiker, for others it is sending the information of its bank account to millionaires of the third world mysteriously without money. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this film would turn out to be its stuttering and repetitive title. But with my voluntary suspension of disbelief intact, and a naive faith derived from the attractive-looking billboard in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Sadly, when the old man in the pawnshop explained the whole background story, fifteen minutes after the photo, I had the sudden revelation that came when knowing every point of the plot of a movie that has not yet been seen. And what is worse: he knew how bad all the points would stink. <br /> <br /> Let me be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of the final evil to adequately describe how bad it is. The movie really is. <br /> <br /> As for knowing all the twists of the movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales are not worthy of completion, the subplots sprouted adequately every time the main characters were threatened by the spectrum of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> He was infested with nearby calls, miraculous escapes and concentrated deposits of poorly explained distress. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if it gave the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers products access to the national defense budget. And a lot of liquor. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain you. <br /> <br /> Imagine you could get all the pieces from the most successful action films of the last decade: First take the amphibian army of Star Wars Episode One that talks Rasta and remove your Prozac until they are ready to Attack the Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Next, take approximations from Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even call him Ethan as a "subtle" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of black film narration, so no one gets confuse while trying to follow the depths of your thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a rough-voiced villain with a pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings and a pair of giant cobras, angered by the removal of his scenes from the latest King Kong edition, and place them in no particular order on the modern day in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now run to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you come back, puree these ingredients until any hint of overlooked originality dissolves into a homogenized mass of cheese and serves semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> At several points during this picture, I found myself saying out loud "Make the bad movie stop" and break into tears. <br /> <br /> Calling this a B movie would be giving you an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, I could go through a C-level movie if I could somehow sleep most of the time. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if you ever run into money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for the horrible and tacit sins against humanity, Dragon Wars could be the movie to you.
