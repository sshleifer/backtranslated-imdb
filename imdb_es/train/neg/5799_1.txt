Yesterday I rented this movie mainly due to the attractive art and the summary that is on the back of the jacket. After placing it on my DVD player, I went back to examining the jacket cover and, even though I pulled it out of the plastic viewfinder, I STILL could not read any detailed information about the production of the film. This movie is titled Evil on the Jacket and had to find it on the Faith Films website to find any link to it here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The shooting and the special effects made on the film looked pretty good. ... THEN, a line reading actor spoke. Oh dear ... the reading of this actor sounded like a high school athlete with pimples whose voice only managed to change the tone, and no attempt to go beyond reading the lines of the script. At first I thought I had a bad disk out of sync audio, then I had to assume it was a foreign movie since I could not read the jacket ... English dialogue folded. If they had chosen the right person to double the dialogue, this movie COULD have been decent. I gave him an opportunity of about 20 minutes before expelling him when I discovered that the faulty line reader was not going to die, but remained the constant main element. Yes, it's that bad! The art of the cover of the jacket and the art made in the film are great, so they gave a star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
