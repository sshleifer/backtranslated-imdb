*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continuation ... <br /> <br /> From here, the whole movie collapses on itself. First, we find a dishonest program with the indication that we are going to get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We have a guy with a retarded accent who talks endless trash, two "ghosts" who have no real purpose and have no character and a lot of henchmen. Someone told me that they are vampires (taken from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not realize. <br /> <br /> The funny accented with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle, only for much longer and much worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, he does it, then he keeps doing it and doing it until he convulses and becomes stupid. His final line before leaving is comparable to the line of Storm-as "in which you know what happens with a toad ..." in X-men in levels of absolute evil. The chocolate cake is such a lazy and pathetic clich√©, and Monica Bellucci, as a wife, does nothing more than what we expect at the moment we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we have another kung fu fight !! WHY? Neo is, supposedly, The One. He can do anything. He has the maximum power and what he uses it for. Kung bloody fu all the time. And although it can stop 1000 bullets, it is still cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 indecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see amazing powers. I wanted to see him do the craziest, craziest and craziest murder of the people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The legendary car chase. That can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's just not what we've been saying it was going to be. ALL the great photos of this scene are in the trailer. All the world. So everything that Wow possibly has taken from us, all we now get is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight! Okay, it's not Neo, but you would have thought that I would have explained to your closest friends the reality of The Matrix. At least he taught them something. Is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix, it's not real, as long as you understand that nothing is real, then nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, then the persecution is not bad. It's never boring and it does not seem like 16 minutes. It is so disappointing. And still, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final climax of the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have all this elaborate plan that involves three crews. Then they only show him sporadically among Morfeo's long and superprofessional monologue. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what this plan is that needs 3 teams. Basically you know, but you do not know who is doing what, when, so when a crew goes down, you just do not care and you do not know how this will affect what happens. <br /> <br /> I will summarize it, however, it happens so that Trinity can return to the Matrix to configure the ending. That is the only reason why it happens. Which raises the question: why did they have to send 6 people originally? Trinity comes in five minutes by herself! <br /> <br /> Neo's trip to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled with the same laziness. Ooohhh !!! He meets another 100 Smiths agents !!! Woooooo !!! That must have taken a lot of thought. Only now they are in a corridor, so the fight has no scale and ends in a moment. Man, what a great ending! <br /> <br /> And then the Architect !!! <br /> <br /> Do you remember everything I said that was bad about the Oracle and the foreigner? Add them together and duplicate them, that's how truly awful the architect is. The only reasonable potential of him is that he is about to establish the hanging climax. <br /> <br /> And then blow it! <br /> <br /> Let's see the options you give to Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies !!! Considering that the choice is something this movie tries to explore, it does not really give its hero one. If he had the option to Save humanity and the lady dies or Save the lady and kill humanity, there is the power of internal torment and tension. Also, since Trinity is in the middle of autumn, the potential of a true cliffhanger that would have made the third most essential look. But no. He has not saved anyone or the lady. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst of the original Matrix was Neo's death and then come back to life at the end. The year everyone left was so upset about how stupid Jar Jar was that they did not realize that the end of The Matrix made him look at Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with the One, and I love you" ... Come on! How can the whole world have overlooked how terrible it was? <br /> <br /> So, what are the Wachowski doing in the sequel? Well, they make the end of the original look better. How? Well, doing almost exactly the same thing again (just exchanging characters) just that it's much worse, I think my fa and r keys would wear out if I kept writing long before it got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger is not really a cliffhanger. It is a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Evil in so many ways. And to make matters worse, this is not a movie with a low budget. It is not a movie with a too short schedule. It is not a movie that has been rushed. It is not a film in which there is too much influence from outside. This is exactly the movie that the Wachowski intend to make with Warner's fortune totally behind them. And that's what makes this so horrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say he did not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not at all. The most disappointing and defamatory film ever made. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt. <br /> <br />
