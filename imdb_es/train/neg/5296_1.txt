I'm not a big fan of slasher movies as a genre, but even by low-budget low-exploitation standards, this is really scarce. Even at a level of nudity and gore, it's incredibly boring (there are some of both, but it's all kind of ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not even have premiered theatrically (although I could have done it, after all, * Plan 9 From Outer Space * played in theaters). There is precisely a good line (and delivered competently) throughout the film; I guess it was stolen from somewhere. <br /> <br /> The performance is among the worst I've seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest used to be ridiculously hammy, which can be fun to watch. In any case, most of its actors could pass as literate. Here, those who do not read their lines like the Indians in the cigar store seem to have learned them phonetically. And this film has a distinction: it manages to be badly embedded in most of the film, then it laughs excessively to the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have chosen the actress who plays the receptionist as an exception - it's not wooden in any way, it's not that it's good, but it certainly is not.) <br /> <br /> Even the worst killing movies are generally good for some puritanical meditations on their grotesque offensive, but with this, there does not even seem to be anything to provoke moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it really becomes fascinating in a strange way. I sat through much of the video wondering why anyone would bother doing it.
