"Power Play" starts interesting but goes downhill quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no redemption value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California in one year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so artificial and completely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a group of third-grade students who put on a play. It's horrible, just horrible. <br /> <br /> In short, if "Power Play" was created in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a poor movie of the "B" class. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a "D" class movie? If so, "Power Play" projects the mold.
