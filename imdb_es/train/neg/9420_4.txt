The follow-up of 1973, much better "Cleopatra Jones", has the sculptural black actress Tamara Dobson who returns to her distinctive role as an elegant and super-resistant narcotics agent, here bursts a network of heroin in Hong Kong. The cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at first but eventually flags. The end of the shootings is off the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she gives a unique twist to her comically forced dialogue, but this setting may have been too much of a thing for her - she's tired). Stella Stevens plays the villain this time; She is good, but she can not match Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** since ****
