A pot - boiler if I ever saw it. An alleged thriller borrowed from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", even an "In The Heat of the Night" reversed with a bit of reverse murder, in the style of "Strangers on a Train" thrown, fails abysmally . Where all of the above, to a large extent, was successful. That is, in the delivery of emotions. The plot seems condensed from a larger book, which makes the plot developments are evident and little involved, while the direction lacks rhythm and enthusiasm. To stop any praise, an important turn on the road had to be delivered and here too it fails in a palpable way. Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothers with his attempt at American accent and, in addition, seems to be too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those damn children of his. He even has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely has the opportunity to fill his role and you are confused from the beginning as to whether he is a bad boy or a good man. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie, here they are, confusingly. The rest of the games are simply average for a reasonable distribution in their stereotypical roles subscribed. The supposed climax also succeeded, rolling leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as it should have been the objective, the leading edge of my seat. Mediocre Hollywood film neglected making sure.
