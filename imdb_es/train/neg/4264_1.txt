This movie disappointed me decidedly. It was a great concept that was ruined by a horrible script. The story simply did not flow and was disjointed at best. There were so many elements in this story that were not explained, or that were forced into place without any real thought. Elements like the love story could have expanded a little more, and cannons should be written better. all the main character who grew up needed more information about the training he was receiving and less to stand around. Everyone likes a good story of "little boys outnumbered", and this was promising, but with the scripting failures it was not like that. While it had some pyrotechnic elements in the final sequence of the battle, it was mediocre due to the lack of choreography. this made for a maddeningly boring watch <br /> <br /> it could have been so good :(
