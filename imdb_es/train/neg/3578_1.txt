There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They took a story of poor quality, they spoiled it, they wrote it badly, they confused it. It has a bad dialogue badly made in a serpenteante history and of bad quality. <br /> <br /> As bad as it fails as an art, it fails even worse than commerce. Who could have been the target market for this. What age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. What would I pay to see? <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this ranks between "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Hands" ... my choices as the three most incredibly bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone who is related to him should be forced to converse with VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise. How could I take this and make it worse? I can not think in a way.
