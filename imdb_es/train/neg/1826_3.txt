I saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers, the only laugh that this movie brought me was when I realized that I was actually watching it. in a word, it is without grace. Unfunny I totally believe Jack Black's curiosity that he apologizes for making this garbage. I can not believe that Barry Levinson not only shot this script when he read the first page. Besides, I can not believe I've seen him more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave her 3 out of 10 * because I love seeing christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck. Also, the "cork" horse, simply existing as a character in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.
