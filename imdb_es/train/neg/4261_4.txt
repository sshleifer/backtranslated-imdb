Pathetic. This is what happens when the director comes to work only because someone is paying him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, excellent locations and settings for a film of epic proportions. But the acting, damn it! I swear, in some shots you can see extras in the background looking at the camera or watching the actors because nobody told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad you wonder, are these people really? They could have done more harm just by hugging each other. In slow-motion scenes, you can see people on the battlefield walking or just standing, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground is emphasized in some way. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogues are silly, the argument of love is more shameful and ridiculous than in the action movies of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the end result of all this enormous effort is a brilliant round laser disk on the thin cover placed on the shelf in the video store.
