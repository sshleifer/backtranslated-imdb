Originally issued as an ABC movie of the week. This involves two young university students who are taken to a prison camp in a small town in the south. Telephone calls are not allowed and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation that lead to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The television version was (for its time) bleak. Not nudity and beatings were quite docile, but the general feeling of heaviness vanished. The unclassified version is even worse: there are abundant nudes, the violence is extreme and, in a particularly unpleasant sequence, we see a prisoner crying forced to undress while a lesbian guard "uses" her. Gross! There is nothing wrong with exploitation films, but this simply goes beyond the limit. You have the feeling that the filmmakers like these poor women to be tortured and degraded, all this gets in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. The unnecessarily annoying end does not help. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because the acting is good, but that makes the movie harder to see. A sick film, of poor quality. Not recommended.
