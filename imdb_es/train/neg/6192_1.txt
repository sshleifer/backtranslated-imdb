The great ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad movie in every way. The script, the lugubrious rhythm, the lack of depth in any character, the subplots without sense, the appalling performance, the unnecessary climax, make this the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything nice, pleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I imagine that the filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark, with their capricious lighting, prolonged silences and vaguely disturbing classical soundtrack. If so, they failed completely. It just bored me and I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
