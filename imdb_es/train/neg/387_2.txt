One has to wonder if at some point in the production of this film there was a script <br /> <br /> that made any sense. Did the cut last about 3 hours <br /> <br /> and cut back on the incoherent disorder that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would someone finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a handsome young man who does what he can <br /> <br /> with the dialogue and the dramatic situations (?) That are given to him. But the characters <br /> <br /> come and go for no apparent reason, the continuity is <br /> <br /> non-existent, and the acting, the cinematography and the direction are (for <br /> <br /> put it politely) amateur. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate title choice <br /> <br /> as it will probably turn out to be false if someone <br /> <br /> tries to watch this movie.
