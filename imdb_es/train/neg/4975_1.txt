After having seen the Canadian / Icelandic / British production of "Beowulf & Grendel" in 2004, which I thought was brilliant and surprising, I approached this, the first of the 3 new Beowulf films that will come out this year, with concern. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the hooves with horns, I moaned. These were the Swedes and the Danes of the migration era, not the Vikings (they arrived later). And even the Vikings never used horns on their helmets (horns make it easier for your enemy to take off your helmet and then cheat on you). Then there is Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a stage for a film about Greece or Rome, not about the sixth-century Denmark. The swords and the armor look like accessories from previous films set in various historical periods. I saw weapons that could have been used by the Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven", and one character was even wielding a sword from the Windlass Steelcrafts playback movie of "Beowulf & Grendel"! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was depressing and the performance totally wooden and unconvincing. The largest yuk was a secret weapon crossbow, complete with sights and explosive projectiles, which looked like something purchased from Iraqi insurgents. The special effects monster and his mother had so many steroids that Beowulf could never have ripped off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for the bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I will not.
