I saw this movie once, and I thought it was fine. Then my friends at work said "Look at it again, it's better". So I did it. And to my surprise, it was WORSE on the second time! There's a word limit, so I'm going to roll the ball here. <br /> <br /> -The scenes of the bombing were so stupid. Why the hell would someone wait to trigger the explosion? -None of the characters here are even remotely nice. Not in the first time, not even in the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single bullet, nor can a fire as big as that be extinguished. small fire extinguisher ... did the previous 3/10 viewers really watch the movie? -The camera is so unstable that I can hardly say what is happening. That opening scene with the robot had an upset stomach, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> -The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") rolled their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did the man place his gun where a person had been shot? Also, why would ESO spend so much time cleaning the bullets, recharging, aiming and NOT firing, when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS types of operation instead of staying and counterattack ?????? Eh ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ...? I did not want to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too much time for your own good, but too short for the amount of material it contains. Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. It seems that she is wrong, the movie is full of superfluous action scenes that are thrown there to distract you from the lack of a central argument. I know that Watchmen lasted more than 163 minutes, but at least that movie did not creep. This film, on the other hand, does it, and because of that, it feels longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, which in the best of cases was satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip this and do not give up.
