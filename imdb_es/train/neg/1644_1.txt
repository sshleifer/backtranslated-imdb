Unquestionably the worst movie I've seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero, but this is easily done. The film is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to talk about their sexual adventures over the weekend. A fourth man, who is married and used to be part of the group, appears and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
