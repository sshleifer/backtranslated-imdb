Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to do it about Leonard Cohen! This is full of Leonard enough to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talking about themselves. Puleeze ... it sounds like they're reliving their diary entries in high school. Who cares, what about Leonard? Guess which people, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone makes a documentary about you. I found the parade of the U2 members particularly insulting as if that added credibility to this movie, NO. Leonard does not need Bono or The Edge talking about his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been that the filmmakers embody a part of their spirituality through the film. Wow, what a concept! I will give material to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their versions of Cohen songs. The rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not notice you!
