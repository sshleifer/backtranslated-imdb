I was so excited and exalted to see this movie when the promotions came out for the first time in November! It looked great and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to see it! This is a movie that weaves 6 couples together. It has a multiple cast of 12 people! A lot of stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not handled the situation well and should not have had a lot of people in this movie, as this would make things easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's directorial debut, 'Kal Ho Naa Ho', 'Salaam-e-Ishq' is left behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star. I think the best factors of this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did an excellent job and did excellent work over the years. I think the ratings of this movie may go up due to the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with was that the director should not have included nudity in this film made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found it very rude to see this with the family! Although, some may find this nude as a comedy, it's not something you want to see with parents! I think the best performance was Salman and Priyanka. In general, I think it's a good movie.
