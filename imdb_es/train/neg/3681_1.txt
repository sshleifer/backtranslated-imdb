My kindness is this bad movie. My criticism of the local movie totally cheated me because this is a certifiable garbage. Yes, yes, the good ones use white, the bad ones use black ... and the good ones always win. Now go home and hug your children, and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can not believe that this mental death movie was made by Wes Craven. I guess he needed a little money to pay off the mortgage, so he made this piece of manure. It's the kind of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe that it could be as good or better than an experienced director. <br /> <br /> You see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves his dad to do a bad thing about IL 'or he's going to hurt his daddy. But being Mrs. All-American, the girl next door, we know she's going to save the day and beat the bad guys ... in the end. Girl power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Come on, only an idiot will find this entertaining ... "a roller coaster", let alone something new or fresh. All the "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from industry hackers who are making money with this movie, paying a favor, or have sold their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful ... yes, that is. It's not a good performance, not a horrible one ... she's just cute. I would have had to show a lot of skin to save this movie. She is not strong enough to be a good female lead. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a foolish villain who pretends to be smart. They kick her in the ass at 5'5 '' McAdams, because after all, she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all the tapes of Tae Bo ... .So she should be able to expel an international terrorist for hire. I would not trust him to steal a pack of chewing gum from 7 to 11. <br /> <br /> You see, this movie was already made, except before they did it right. Re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except that the characters are more pleasant and credible and the bad ones are much more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can continue to commit so much crap as if they did not take into account the right models that they can easily copy. No wonder that the movie's revenue has gone down. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 into the toilet and save 2 hours of your life you will never recover. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
