Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a hitman, agent of the CIA and special operation of pure evil. During his free time, Dial puts on a cowboy hat and raises horses with macho names like Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter agent Collins, your supervising officer. Enter a new assignment: kill a terrorist who is in the custody of the United Kingdom. Of course, the fact that the United Kingdom is an allied state is a great place for covert operations and head shots outside the courts. <br /> <br /> The murder is a great success, apart from the fact that the escape plan exploded. Then Dial's partner and local liaison die in action trying to escape from the police, while Dial becomes a hot property with the London cops trying to get at him and the CIA trying to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the Safe Day she is usually visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves to hang out with cold blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil police of the United Kingdom ... <br /> <br /> With a script like that I need to say more? On the positive side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be it a pro or a con man) and the movie is quite attractive. The negative edition is very disjointed and has a throwing effect in the stomach.
