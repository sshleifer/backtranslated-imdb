(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and unfortunately I can inform you that the film barely lived up to them. <br /> <br /> Although I loved seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writers should have realized at the beginning of the writing process that seven people who fall into the water are not original or fun . The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that are not, it's just boring. I smiled like three times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The location of Swedish Findus products is (inadvertently) fun, why not just a big sign that says? "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not need to be seen at the movies or on DVD, just wait for it to air on TV, it will not take long.
