From time to time a movie will appear that will be so horrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my days and I can save a single soul from watching this movie, how great my joy will be. <br /> <br /> Where to start my discussion about pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no development of the character. Each character was a stereotype. We had an oath, a fat man who eats donuts, a foreign fool, etc. The script felt as if it was written while the movie was filmed. The production value was so incredibly low that I felt like I was watching a high school video presentation. The directors, producers, etc. Have you ever seen a movie? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with each new entry. The concept for this movie sounded very funny. How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors? But trust me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY BAD.
