Even though this was a production made for TV, there is absolutely no excuse for the bottom line results of the finished product. This film YES had a budget and had a casting department, so if you are going to make a film about a real life story, and actually put "the true story" in the title, you should not make any effort. To try to capture some realism? First of all, this movie is absurdly broadcast. These actors belong to the daytime soap operas, or those ridiculous films of the Lifetime channel, and not to a tale of gangsters or real life criminals. Everything about them, from their appearance to their manners, only screams from the generation of rock listeners of the 90's shopping mall-alt-rock. What's up with the script? Two words describe it: stupid and insulting, and again, it sounds too stupid. I do not believe that the real Clyde Barrow has uttered the words "I'm leaving here." It's as if a group of "New Kids on the Block" fans came together and decided to make a "Kewl movie" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be totally radical and rock. Well, this sticker is not even classified on the scale of rad and rockin '. Everything that can be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong here, from casting and acting to editing and music. Everything is totally wrong ... and it is exasperating that the responsible parties of this atrocious turkey had the courage to put "the real story" in the title. It's certainly NOT the real story, but what's worse, it's not even remotely entertaining like a meaningless popcorn movie that is accepted on its own terms. As I said in my headline, it's just horrible beyond words, at every conceivable level. Trust me in this, or look at your own risk.
