The film seems disconnected and in general, poorly written. The script advances as if written by 10 different people, and none of them communicated with each other. Apparently, they wanted to take a page from a Miracle movie on 34th Street (the original), but it's done so poorly that the movie falls apart. This movie is only for the youngest, and even THEY will see the fact that whoever wrote it knows little or nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the Angels are in last place, the owner does not seem to mind, nor does it bother him that his manager has quarreled with his pitcher? In the mouth? or that PUNZÓ to the game announcer per team game on live television. However, when the team is at one of the games winning the Division, it becomes out of shape due to a story (obtained by a 6 year old child) in which the manager is receiving help from a child who claims to see angels real. What sounds worse? A violent out-of-control manager and loser whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or a winning trainer on the edge of the playoffs who is acting a bit eccentric and is helping to raise children? The owner's reaction does not make sense. And he has moved to change his mind for Maggie and his speech "straight to cliché" during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ??? The Angels are supposed to play for the Division in the final weekend series against the White Sox, however, at the end of the game, the announcer goes on to say that the Angels won the pennant. "The pennant is not decided until someone win the LIGA championship, not the division title of the regular season. <br /> <br /> Whitt Bass, the foolish pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the losing streak of the Angels ? Then is the starting pitcher? THE VERY NEXT DAY. <br /> <br /> It is said that Mel Clark (Tony Danza) in the ninth inning threw 156 pitches, in a low scoring ball game. , in the low scoring games, the throw count is MUCH lower than this, usually around 80-90 pitches. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL" the angel says at the end that "the championships must earn themselves ", even though he and his angels have been manipulating and arranging games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, since there are MANY other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years old), this movie can be entertaining. It is very bad ?? Done well this could have been a classic. Done in this way, it is a disaster that will be forgotten and will always remain as a UHF / cable wash on Saturday mornings.
