*** SPOILER LIGHT ALERT *** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, you're probably waiting for a deep and intense film that can offer some information for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships. <Br /> <br /> Truly, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do it, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's performance is so dry that she lacks any sensation, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems nervous about the camera. His only scene of feelings is almost at the end, where his girlfriend abandons her. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and, what's worse, it does not seem natural. Maria had the attitude, even if it was pushed artificially to be obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we do not have an idea of ​​it: where did it come from, how did you get involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only receive some fragments of their parents and their relationship seems to be there: it has a content and an end, but not a beginning. Like her partner María, she only has one scene that is really touching, the scene where she leaves Maria's character, Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (apart from the owner, the great performance there) who manages to try out some acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and he has left. Only once or twice does he seem to hesitate (in the scene of his parents' food, he tries to be obvious when it was not necessary). <br /> <br /> I love history, Tudor Chirila is fine there. , the landlady really acts and Puya delivers her pair of lines with style, but this does not save the movie. Too bad, the whole scenario had enormous potential and Romanian filmmaking could have used a film on this subject. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the non-disco. No-background feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a good attempt in this direction) Maria and Ioana's lesbian relationship. I am very sorry to spend money on a ticket, I would rather have seen it from the comfort of my room.
