SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> It's not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look pretty good considering the little one budget they have. had to work with The movie is apparently an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants to a sealed "danger zone" and has three spooky costumed sent to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, gains fame and fortune ... all the others end up dead. The main drawback of this movie is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seems real at all. The actors who play the killers are pretty funny ... because they represent corny and exaggerated caricatures of the popular types of modern horror films ... and that's exactly how they would be done if it were a real show. The film is intended to be made in one shot ... there is a cameraman who follows the participants around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights are still flashing constantly (for hide the "cuts" from one shot to another, I imagine).
