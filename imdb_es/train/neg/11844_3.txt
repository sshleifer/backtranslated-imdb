Anyone who likes the jazz of the 1920s, the dress of the 1920s, the Charleston and ultra-elegant yachts (for example, I, in all respects) will want to like this movie. But the sad thing is that that's all there is to it. The plot is banal and obvious, the performance is mostly horrible or playing on the ridiculous side of what is happening, and when everything is over, there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a wonderfully poorly made movie.
