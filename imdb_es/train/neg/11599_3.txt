The only thing that prevented this movie from being a total disaster was a couple of interesting style touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is a bit derived from a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which offers death by caricature. However, this was handled very well, especially seeing how the ink bleeds and how the color is erased. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a demonic motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Having said that I was glad to have bought the cheap DVD from a store that went out of business, because it was pretty horrible. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films were equally upset with the constant findings that you have been watching a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to trade, or if it makes any sense, at least I had a couple of notes with style, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the DVD lets you go The 8 'nightmares' where something really happens, which is the only way to see this. The scripts between the creative gore moments are quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
