This film is similar to the work titled 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium is strongly linked to Coward's writing. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is an imitation, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sorry. These films are so expensive to produce. I encourage myself when a script is original. I even encourage myself when it is an innovative way to produce a work that was launched earlier. Some samples (like Topper, etc.) were mentioned. <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I'm not happy when the public's taste is taken for granted. In this situation, the public's taste is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I hope for a better movie entertainment produced. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer to see the work.
