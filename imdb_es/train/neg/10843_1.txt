This may have been done for the fun of it, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years. The best of all the DVD would be the case! I'm surprised that people have taken the time to do something so stupid and yet spend money on that too, I'm glad they just rented it. I guess the true fans of this movie would probably have to be sadistic and goth to worry about it without capturing any CGI or any other effect. I hope that Alex Chandon has learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better movie. the future, that is, if you are still at work. <br /> <br /> Notes for buyers, this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!
