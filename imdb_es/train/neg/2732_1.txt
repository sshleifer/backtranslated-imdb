When "My Leave Vu, My Leave Vu" aired last season, I was glad. Scrubs, I thought, is doing something smart and unique in regards to the concept of clip-show. Instead of reproducing the images, they are playing jokes in a self-conscious way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very unfortunate that I was wrong. A season later, they succumbed to what almost all the comedies inevitably do, the clip program ... and it seemed that it was created by the guy's work experience. Dr. Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors were when putting them together, since he does not appear again until 'My Long Goodbye' about 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig is too much effort to maintain the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. Who knows why he was placed there, he just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (in large part) of the episodes that were aired last year. <br /> <br /> Three seconds stuck together with background music is an extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not a prime-time television episode.
