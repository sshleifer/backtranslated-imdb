I bet that Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes would be willing to appear. Is not it simply meant for Gene to change the women's team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a rat!" double episode shit? All that clich√© of the mafia, jokes. The big rejected names have simply already received money for their charity and obtained a personalized exit. Hmm ... This is not reality but dramatized drama! Mark Burnett's other program, "Survivor," also asked me questions when Johnny Fairplay organized his departure when he clearly had little time before his son was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
