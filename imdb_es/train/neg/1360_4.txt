A reasonable effort is summary for this movie. A good movie from the sixties but lacking in a sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough but not as good as she could have done it, other actors were simply terrible! A terrible portrait. It was not very funny and, therefore, he did not really achieve his genres, since he was not particularly funny or dramatic. The only genre reached at a satisfactory level was romance. The hearings were not reached and the film sent confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic plot were not carried out or carried out well, and people were confused about why the film was not so good and who were the target audiences, etc. However, Maggie was pretty good and the plot was good with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
