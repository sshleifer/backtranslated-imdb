Well, then the introduction, with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fear during the movie, is so boring that funny. And so, the first "scene of the skull" is so strange and without suspense that it is funny. The real plot of the film is a bit decent, there is at least a bit of genuine food to think about the behavior of the characters, and the plot twist is decent as the horror movies advance. The performance is average, it's not really bad. <br /> <br /> Together, this movie does not fall off as much as a 1/10 movie would. It is not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even the second lowest. If I just read the script, I would say there is a potential for this to be a decent movie. It's just the horrible direction and production that ruins the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there are other, much worse ones out there.
