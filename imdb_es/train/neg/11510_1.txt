It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me see it. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive to say about this movie. For many years there has been an idea that Madonna could act, but she can not. There has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he is only in the middle. A shame for everyone. <br /> <br />
