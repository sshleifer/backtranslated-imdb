Hello people. <br /> <br /> Forget about that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as an executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke. <br /> <br /> The first vampires were good ... and they were the only vampires. This thing here only carries the same name. <br /> <br /> Just a waste of time thinks ... <br /> <br /> JAKE Scorpio
