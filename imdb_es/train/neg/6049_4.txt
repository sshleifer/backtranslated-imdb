First of all, anyone who thinks that this sequel to "The French Connection" by William Friedkin is superior, is definitely completely insane or foolish, or both. The problem with the revision of this movie is that, a.) It is a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes it objectively difficult, and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors of all times, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug trafficking in the decadent city of New York, due to his documentary approach to action and history, Frankenhimer, on the other hand, is one of the most elegant directors of the History, that is, "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds", and with his "French Connection 2" feels like someone who tries to be brave and does not have the true understanding to achieve it. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself really says a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed not to work with him again. It is also known that he imagined that the character was more one-dimensional, he lost weight and tried to interpret him as a heterosexual character. It shows you that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the story were great. The point of the plot that Doyle becomes addicted is interesting, but it does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
