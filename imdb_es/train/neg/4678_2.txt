This movie had some andrenaline shooters, but it's an old story that simply could never happen. Navy protocols could never break so much that a crew, much less an XO could go so far against the Captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - the United States Navy did not support this movie.
