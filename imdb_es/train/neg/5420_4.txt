FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> < Br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mingle with a couple of floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after visiting a theater that burns in his absence! It goes without saying that his tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) do not have fun ... <br /> <br /> The comedy OK by Leo McCarey established the narrative framework of the SONS OF THE DESERT masterpiece (1934) ), with L & H playing the victims of the circumstances hit by the forehead, forced to say a monstrous lie that is counterproductive in a spectacular way. Much of this is very funny, especially the scene where Deslys makes fun of Stan, which leads to a violent pushing and shoving game. However, part of the fun is undermined by Oakland and Flowers, who play their roles completely straight, which adds an element of displeasure to the "boastful husband" scenario. Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
