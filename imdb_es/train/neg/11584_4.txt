About twenty minutes in this movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty boring. Occasionally, something fun would happen, but then things would slow down. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded, and the end of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to justify sitting for the first ninety minutes. Therefore, I would say that the film was mediocre in general and, considering all the talent of the cast, I would call this a disappointment.
