When the memory of childhood tells you that this was a scary movie; It's touching and you're ready to review it. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a great villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's full of those police clich√©s and a very poor script with holes that a truck could go through (along with innumerable convenient "turns" that help keep the story going). Lou Diamond Phillips is the mistrusting ass cop who sends serial killer Kdiebie to the gas chamber only to discover that he himself was a henchman of Satan and now has the power of resurrection along with the power to possess each person of weak mind that he comes through Through the mixture of a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, this is garbage. But nice as such, especially if you have good memories of it. It scared me when I was a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; Forget it, almost all scenarios are presented in large measure and you end up with a cross between an action movie by Steven Segal and a demonic movie of the 70s. And who the hell thought it was a good idea to choose Lou Diamond Phillips at the helm here? Needless to say, it is not convincing at all, but it does everything possible and I have never had the problem with the guy that so many critics seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less said, the better. But Kober is pretty good as the killer; always liked that actor. <br /> <br /> "The first power" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day of work and a "brain shutdown" is needed. Most likely, beer improves the visual experience and I will definitely have it the next time I turn this movie around. All in all; It's not a good movie, it's a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who easily get scared when they're little. "See you friend"!
