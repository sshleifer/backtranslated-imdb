This is the story of a young woman seduced and then abandoned by her older and married lover after becoming pregnant; She takes revenge against him, and all her family, through black magic? which, disappointingly, she does not do to herself but someone else does it for her. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror movie. But the soft script never generates suspense, the director approaches the material in a totally conventional way, and the final act loses the sympathy of the spectator for the victims when throwing the logic to the winds. At any given moment, a character has the main opportunity to simply shoot the villain and, instead, get up and run away without raising the weapon. Bad writing ?? you are soaked in it! <br /> <br /> Some spooky effects, including a corpse of the really tasteless late fetus and a man dying to have hundreds of live eels coming out of his stomach. Only recommended for the finalists of the genre who simply have to see all the horror films produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
