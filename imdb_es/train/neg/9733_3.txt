Pretty poor clone of Firestarter that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. What a disappointment it is that Hooper and Dourif come to this! <br /> <br /> Government contractors conduct a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The child born to the experiment partner constantly has a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, the people in his life begin to burn spontaneously. Try to find out why. <br /> <br /> People who are completely on fire are well done, but when they get to the point where they are well made in another direction, they have obviously become mannequins. When the jets of fire shoot out of the arms of the characters, it seems silly instead of alarming as it should be. It is also ridiculous fire that obviously travels through telephone lines and erupts in huge jets of receiver receiver. How is that supposed to happen, exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing that seemed silly to me about the film is when a character has visions of his deceased parents. Later we see the same shots of those visions in the home movies.
