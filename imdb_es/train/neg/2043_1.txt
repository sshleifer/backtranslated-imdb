Horrible, frightening, frightening. <br /> <br /> A condescending comment at the beginning and some unpleasant autopsy photos are not a good movie. Once again, I am surprised at the determination and ability of some people to achieve a film production and yet they do not have the pride to realize that what they have done is a lot of garbage. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a redemptive function to be able to at least balance my criticisms, but the only one I could think about was that Pink's opening song was pretty good ... I wonder if she has seen this. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk, boredom can kill you.
