Bonjour Tristesse covers a field similar to "The wedding member". Namely, a possessive daughter tries to avoid forming a relationship between a loved relative and an intruder. While critics love 'Member of the Wedding', it seems to me that Julie Harris is a jagbo-drag and an adenoidal theanist and that she eats landscapes in everything she's been in. This portrays irritating and rich idiots like last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a travel notebook. <br /> <br /> In this Preminger movie, the sequences develop, but the characters do not. For the first 30 minutes, he is content to confuse the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, which makes sexual readings uncomfortable. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not deliver the depth required by the piece. Kerr gets rank and turns the movie into 'Endless Love'. The vacuous narration of Seberg, it's like something out of Strange Interlude, it's not good. I really wish that someone other than Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing the orthodox British behavior in all his films, never approaching the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, a night of dancing becomes a free place for everyone in a port. . Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, 'The conformist'. Kerr is on board to join hands and portray another great pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven knows Mr. Allyson, Tea and sympathy, etc., etc.). Actually, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie with her could end in a fatal car accident, or better yet, start with one. <br /> <br /> People who feel uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
