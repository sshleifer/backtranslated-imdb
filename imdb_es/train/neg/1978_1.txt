Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheezy dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell happened to that? The director of this film acts as badly as the movie he did. If someone had taken some time and effort to get the whole thing back to work, he might have had an opportunity. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they could ruin it so much. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian girl was not that bad either. These girls also took the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would have destroyed my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If any of you who have not yet seen and have any idea of ​​doing so, do not waste your time ... you will only regret it later.
