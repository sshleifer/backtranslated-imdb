This anime series begins great: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is explained immediately, hanging a proverbial carrot before the viewer, attracting the viewer to see each subsequent episode. But imagine the disappointment of discovering that the science fiction / giant robot adventure is just a backdrop for the exploitation of psycho-babbling and almost religious preaching. If you want to hear "You're fine, it's good to be you." After being assaulted with negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, then this is for you. If you want a good science fiction movie that is simply fun to watch, forget about it. Both the original and the alternative endings were tremendously disappointing for me. All that, And this movie was too preached.
