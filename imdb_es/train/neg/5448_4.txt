Doris Day never lets a bad script discourage her. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually emerges unharmed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life blackout in New York in 1965, but actually adapted from a French work of the late 50's by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do, except her own bauble image and, in the second half, be comfortably sedated (which is fun due to the turn the Day gives to the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the stupidity of the material has obviously been moved from the play ... and instead of evoking some funny incidents within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. The co-stars of Doris (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not very suitable for her, and neither is the shapeless hairstyle they have. Still, it's not terrible, it has some big laughs, and for Day-buffs it's a must. ** since ****
