I was sincerely surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering and being killed. The extension of the character's development was to give each character a name and an occupation, and that's it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes started on their own, coming from nowhere with a techno track. While I was watching this movie, I was wondering "Where is this happening? What's happening?" The acting was dramatic quality in high school, with a delivery of rigid wood, as if the actors were reading the cards without understanding their lines. Their problems in delivering lines became even more obvious because of the horrible sound design. ADR sounded as if it had been recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking care of hitting their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. Therefore, these apathetic automatons are displaced through a series of improbable and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. This was happening, now that is happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine dollars though.
