Before, when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a Hollywood couple of great temperament and temperament, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-scene remake of the action novel Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw of 1972 about a fugitive duo. It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen. Even with the stone silent and tired, he could feel the ticking of his watch, his cautious magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor. If so, this is not a showcase for your attributes. Basinger does it well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mobster role. A secondary plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's former partner was unbearable in the '72 film and works even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are a pretty old hat, which makes one wonder: why even redo the original? ** since ****
