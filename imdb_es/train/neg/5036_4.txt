SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> The bad girl of 15 Melissa is new in a desert city and it's not long before the people around you begin to die. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his daughter Nancy Drew and his daughter on Friday the 13th, Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are the main suspects as they seem to displease the injured citizens. All of these events led to the killer's revelation at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> This lower than average slasher is not memorable. It has a TV sensation, without much punctuation, in addition to the musical theme of the title character, which is played a couple of times. Lines like "the killer will turn us into cabbage salad". It fits the standard scripts of the eighties. Marci calls Melissa a bad name and, somehow, they immediately develop a friendship. Apparently, Marci sees how difficult it is to fit because Melissa knows how to use makeup. This film would be difficult to make today, with the main character of fifteen years and the director inserting several free close-ups of it. The social commentary on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised by the rather high rating that this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that honorable tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of butchery, but I feel I did not deliver. But on the positive side, the release of dark films like this one on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
