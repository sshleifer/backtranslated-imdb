I had the distinct displeasure of watching this film at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. I have been attending this festival for more than 5 years, and I have certainly seen some bad movies at times. However, 'First Bite' has reached a new minimum in the cinema. Despite having been filmed in beautiful places, with the exquisite close-up of a fabulous meal, the film twists an excessive number of plot twists and stigmatized characters until I practically begged it to end. <br /> <br /> The main actor, David La Haye, failed to show the development of any character throughout the film, representing a pompous chef from start to finish. Additional subplots, such as eating disorders, developed so poorly that they did not fit completely into any context that the film had shown up to that point. <br /> <br /> A theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt. To hide a movie that does not achieve anything, it does not go anywhere, and disappoints completely.
