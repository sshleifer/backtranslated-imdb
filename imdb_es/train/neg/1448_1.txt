Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. Most Texans do not live as this movie suggests. The plot is weak, and the false accents are fun, and reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans drink beer, honky-tonkin, rednecks. The horribly false accents of Texas is what kills me. It is true that there is a certain touch in Texas with the accent of most Texans, but these people exaggerate it. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make accents in Texas. It just does not work John Travolta should have stuck to disco dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than Texan.
