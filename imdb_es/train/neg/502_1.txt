This film is not only a very bad movie, with horrible actors, or presumed actors, a boring address and an unattractive story, it also copies exactly one scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most famous psycho-thrillers in Italian cinema and a cult movie around the world. In "La Sanguinusa leads the dance", the director repeats the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl, with a furtive glance from a bedroom window. Naturally, the scene in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of Martino's film. Putting another black girl, another white girl and another who repeats the scene is simply the most appropriate way to show that Rizzo's film has no ideas, no originality, no taste, or nothing at all. I think such things are an offense to the viewer.
