I do not have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful journey of strength for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic failures in the history of cinema. The fact that it was the final film by Sellers makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> The terrible script, the direction and the shocking interpretations of wood come together terribly to make this one of the most incredibly horrible movies ever made. <Br /> <br /> I wish so much that I could find even a giggle or a giggle buried somewhere in this putrid fat pile, but it is a disaster with no life or humor. Truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you have stopped at BEING THERE?
