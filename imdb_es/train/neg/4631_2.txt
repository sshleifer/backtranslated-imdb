Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde protagonist, this film is just an excuse to let her undress several times (not in 1954 when this film was made, not in 1965). <Br /> <br /> The guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse looks like Bud Abbott of Abbott & Costello. Most other women are not attractive, and the drunken woman is semi-funny in a creepy way. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvy physique, but can not judge anyone. Acting talent because the entire movie is post-dubbed. Some of these "exploitation films", usually made later than this one, are interesting in some way, but this is really a boring festival. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR PAPER) directed. There are some facial expressions similar to samurai and interesting apartments, but there really is NOTHING in this.
