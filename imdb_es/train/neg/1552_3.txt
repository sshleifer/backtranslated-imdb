This movie was very well publicized. I'm an avid fan of the movie and I've seen breakthroughs for this movie for months. Although I was somewhat skeptical about how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and I was excited about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh in most things of the movie just to not feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, besides, I wanted my money to come out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, I do not try to enter it with too many expectations, but this movie was not so much fun. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for on HBO. If you have not seen many previews of the movie or you like very slow and cheesy comedies, you may enjoy them, but for the true fans of comedy, that is, pass. Maybe he even takes a look at The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see the parents!
