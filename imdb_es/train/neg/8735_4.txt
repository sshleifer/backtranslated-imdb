This movie disappointed me a little. It looked a lot like the Jaws movie when the Hopper told the mayor to close the parks, it was like when Roy Shider told the mayor to close the beaches. They both said their summer in no way! But the box says that Hopper has to get into the mind of a murderer and think as such. But he really does not do anything too interesting or exciting. I am not even a little convinced that he and his partner have experience in the work of the police when they are in the office wondering how they are going to solve this case. They only say that we do police work and we will solve it. And what about all the old ones with billiard cues? I did not even begin to believe that they were Mafia bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy the mafia chose to handle the killer. With his hundred dollar haircut and he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on, what raw lines. I thought I was going to hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I got this used film and I would not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone on the scene where Hopper goes out for coffee.
