Shiri Appleby is the prettiest incarnation of the wicked turned into the good clone girl of Buffy, Elle. But I'm getting ahead of myself, you see that Lilith was the first woman made by God as a companion of Adam. But she had all the feminist evil, so God expelled her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not very well explained), Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy-clone who has to fight with a crazy. Scientist who received an injection of Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded horribly convoluted, that's because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and for a movie with a plot based on theology, it does not seem to know anything about it. This bargain basement, bad CGI movie was apparently a failed serial pilot. All I can say about the fact that it was not detected is a sound Amen. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; and gallery of stills; Video effects samples: before and after (it also has a "also available" selection that I WOULD THINK would take you to some trailers, but not on the DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> < br /> DVD-ROM extras: final recording script and transcription of deleted scenes in PDF format
