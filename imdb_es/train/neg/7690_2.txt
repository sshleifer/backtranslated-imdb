Anyone who gives this film a good review, obviously, must have had something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The acting is rigid, the generic soundtrack of values ​​is ridiculous, the direction is insipid and the strangest of all, the teacher is not really that attractive (making the flagrant advances of the student even more uncomfortable). The creative minds behind this garbage must dissolve and spread to avoid further demonstrations of such concentrated concentration. I am sure that some hungry children in Africa could have used the money wasted in this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened purpose feeding a crack addict; At least someone would be getting some entertainment. For the sole reason that I did not get a terminal illness, I will give two to this movie.
