When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought I could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> They tricked us, to pikes. <br /> <br /> For my part, I felt that Billy Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Sure, he made a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but occupy space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows she plays well as a determined and determined lady. In this movie, she seems completely repressed and had very little fire. This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife likes to see. <br /> <br /> Okay, if I had to find something good, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now that's entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, almost nothing of his character is shown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of meaningless laughter with very little redemptive value, go and see it. But if you're looking for an intelligent and romantic comedy, this is not your movie. It is not any of the above.
