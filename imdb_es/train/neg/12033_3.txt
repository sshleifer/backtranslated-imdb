Film about a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves, looking for the overwritten dialogue, the mediocre performance, the green jelly salad with shredded carrots and any other "Mormon inner joke" known to man. Anyone who is outside of Mormon culture will have difficulty supporting this movie. Anyone in Mormon culture will have a little fun with a laugh here and there. You'll be much better off watching the other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than trying to sit through it. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has had in his hands much more quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both movies about this grunt.
