This film stars, among others, "SlapChop", Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco, are not exactly the names that shout "quality". And with such edifying parodies as "Supermodels taking a dumpster" (that's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who steals a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotten corpse, black market fetuses (with a guy who take something out) are supposed to be out of a jar), many gay jokes, a sketch about a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortions. The scenes are painfully not very funny (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is coarse for the simple fact of being raw ... and stupid. I really believe that a group of 8 year olds could have EASILY made a fun movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie resulted in a demand for "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I would not know who to support in this case! Apparently, he claimed that, somehow, Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this movie. It does not matter that the film is disgusting, from start to finish and with 99% discontent (in comparison, Ebola is more fun) ... and these are the best things I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> By the way it is it is Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in the silent fake porn movie. It's amazing that his career has been able to overcome this.
