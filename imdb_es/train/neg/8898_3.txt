Can false scenery ruin a photo? You would not think about it, but really for me here. Listen, I have many classic films of the era and I know very well what to do, like the drivers who drive immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of that Hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have false landscapes, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in "Brigadoon" become insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> As for musical entertainment, this is always subjective. What songs a person likes, not another, so it should not be an important part of judging a movie (if someone likes songs). It could explode this film for its melodious songs, dances, romances and 1950s characters, but that was in the 50s and many people liked this kind of thing. The musicals did very well in the 50s. I liked the 30s and 40s with the great touches. In the 1950s, the tap was out and this new material, which I can stand, was that. Does that make this a bad movie? No. It's just one that I did not care about much <br /> <br /> Despite the good cast, the good director and the high expectations, this movie was bombed at the box office and with me. I should have liked it more, to be a dreamer and that's a good part of this story. I'm not the cynical type, a nice city and a good people that makes me feel good, sounds horrible. Then, why could not I connect with this movie? Part of it was also dancing. I'm not interested in the things that replaced tap dancing on the screen. But, no, the thing really turned me off what that staging. There was no Scotland, no highlands, only a hokey-like background to make it look that way and it made me almost from the start. Write down a point for today's realism where you "go to the place" most of the time.
