"The Domino Principle" is, without a doubt, one of the worst thrillers ever made. You can hardly understand the complicated plot and, halfway, you will want to raise your arms in frustration and shout "I surrender!" <br /> <br /> How Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer got involved in this mess should only be summarized in his paychecks. <br /> <br /> I hope you have spent your money well.
