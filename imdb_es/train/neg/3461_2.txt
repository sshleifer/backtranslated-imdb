Slasher films are often seen as derivative, repetitive, and frankly not original. It turns out that I am a fan of horror movies, but this movie was very poor, words fail me. The script is very absent, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is surprisingly bad. Only a general bad smell, that I wasted the time of my life. This had all the entertainment value of a fifteenth sequel to a movie that was ominous in the first place. <br /> <br /> Who illuminated this disaster? <br /> <br /> I just liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask, which was nice. The second was Austrailian's affinity with humorous profanity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this horrible mess.
