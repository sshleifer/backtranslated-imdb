The script was VERY weak without enough character arcs for you to worry a bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is too talkative and there is not enough bleeding or action to call it slow rhythm. The story reaches the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you do not have to listen to them speak this dialogue so mute and rigid. In a technical note, the mix of music is too loud and makes it difficult to understand what is said most of the time. On the other hand, this could be called a blessing. In general, this same story could have been better told in a short film with a run time of less than 30 minutes. The obvious tributes "in your face" to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they look more like a bald-faced scam. Come on, is this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best thing to do? Even so, the cinematography, the lighting design and the shots were very well done.
