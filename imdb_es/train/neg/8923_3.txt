Like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne received "the largest train set in the world" to play, but unfortunately he did not have the ability to do anything but see his train set become a train crash from which it is still spoken with surprise. and a strange kind of fear. In spite of the postmodern interpretations that pretend to see it as a gay or even a feminist tract, the fact is that it was a great disaster in 1970 and it is still one today. Anyone who has made himself known to the resources available to Mr. Sarne could have spoiled it. so, in a real way, it's still a well-kept secret. Only Michael Cimino approached the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes "Heaven's Gate". Both films seemed to be ego trips for their respective directors, but at least Mr. Cimino had made one of the best films of the 1970s before squandering the generosity of the studio, while Mr. Sarne had only the "Joanna" in her locker. In addition, "Heaven's Gate" could boast of memorable and well-managed pieces where, tragically, the "Myra Breckinridge" closet was empty. In short, it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that fuels Hollywood history.
