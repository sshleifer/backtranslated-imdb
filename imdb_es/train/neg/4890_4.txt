A film about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband from Mountie whom she loves ... but she also loves sex! In the course of the film, she has several men in bed, including her husband AND her brother! There is also a lesbian (domesticated) sequence. <br /> <br /> This movie put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I think) the first critically acclaimed X-rated film. It was a great success when it came out. Unfortunately, it does not have a good date. <br /> <br /> It is well directed and Erica Gavin is great (whatever happened to her), and it was VERY colorful ... but by today's standards it is extremely docile. It surprises me that now it has a classification NC-17: there is no hardcore sex and only has topless females and without male nudity. It is also (sadly) rather boring and the addition of the policy at the end was confusing (and quite silly). However, it is worth seeing what was considered very shocking in 1968. I supposedly saw the cut version (which has an R rating), but I have listened only a few seconds here and there. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film, "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls", is much better and is VERY good. Catch that in its place.
