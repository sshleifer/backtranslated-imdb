This is the most horrible movie I've seen in my life but, to be honest, you can see it and it's pretty funny. I do not think the filmmakers want it to be their typical blockbuster Hollywood success. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who is immersed in a load of toxic waste that causes a reaction with him and the snow (since it's half winter). Then he becomes a murderous snowman that is enough to make you laugh on his own. This movie is really stupid but it's funny. The murders are hilarious. I would not advise you to buy it (as I did, the cover looked good!) But if it happens that it is on TV one night and you are ready to laugh, then keep it.
