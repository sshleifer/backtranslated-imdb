For the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a maddeningly incoherent film from France that gives the so-called "art movies" a bad name. Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes to Tahiti for a heart transplant, has something to do with the story, but beyond that, I have no idea who the people in the film were or why they did what made. They were doing. Without a coherent plot to brag about, the film loses us from the start, although I am perfectly willing to admit that there could be SOMEONE who really gets a deep message from this movie. <br /> <br /> This confusing, snail-pace drama lasts two hours and five full minutes, although I seriously doubt that someone with some kind of life is still awaiting the final credits.
