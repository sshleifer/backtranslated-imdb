I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited anxiously to see this episode. First I will comment on the movie, then the episode MST3K. The recipe for this movie: bring talented actors, rich and beautiful material from Shakespeare and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then drain from all life and movement, until opaque and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, smooth stone cauldron. Film, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little credit. Well, now the episode MST3K. I admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep in the middle. I understand that that was the reaction of several other members as well. However, when I saw it a second time, I realized that there was a lot of smart references and good lines that I missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes a couple of visits to capture each line. Give him a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
