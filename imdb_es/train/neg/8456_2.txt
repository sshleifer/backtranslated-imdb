I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay until the end. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked Jean Hugues Anglade, but I think he needed to eat, like us, and so he agreed to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called 'art' or something I could not express, but I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only movie I saw was the worst, but now I'm pretty sure I have enough experience to see it successfully again. <br /> <br /> Good luck! ; or)
