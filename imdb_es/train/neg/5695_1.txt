This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi indicate that it is a humorous movie of gangsters. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous female protagonist initiates a series of absurd twists of the plot that do little to hide the artificial ending. The film moves between comedy (the description is used lightly) and surreal drama with some adult scenes out of context. The protagonist (the Angel of the title) has a bad performance and the actress does not get help from the script, which requires something incredible. ends of character to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part well, but he is also disappointed by the poor script. One to avoid.
