['The worst movie I&#39;ve seen in quite some time. Interesting first half with a concise and concise dialogue between doubtful characters in a night bar. Then, the film degenerates into a succession of shapeless scenes that seek the visual shock (read disgust) without redeemed observations or lessons about humanity or anything else. <br /><br /> I wanted to leave, but the director was present in this presentation and my courtesy prevented me from showing him lack of respect. Still, time is precious (as the director himself noted in his introduction) and I really envy the time I wasted in the second half of this. <br /><br /> The savings thanks were the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female lead.']
