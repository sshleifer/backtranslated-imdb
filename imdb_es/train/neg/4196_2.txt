This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not only the story, but the performance is surprisingly bad. The dialogue sounds as if someone were reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is rated as comedy / drama / romance, it's not like that! It's a small action, that's it. There really is NO comedy and drama. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see this, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Almost anything else you choose to look at will be better. This is more or less an action / crime movie. The action scenes stank, and part of the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story, or a good performance. And he simply wants to see a "foreign" movie because of the attraction of being a foreigner. Then this could be for you.
