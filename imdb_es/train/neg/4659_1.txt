This movie is a waste of film. Do you think the map of a military mission plan would be placed on an easel in a courtyard in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom to see? It happened in this movie. Do you think a DEAF person would actually join the army on active duty in Europe during World War II to serve in a "black" unit ... kitchen, supply services, burial details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you think that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. Be part of an active combat mission to prevent the Germans from destroying a dam before the allies arrive? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised if the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was coming from behind and would attack and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised if a group of American soldiers detained in a barn on a farm where the Germans were standing would shout their emotions when they saw the German soldiers who were 50 'away? They did it in this movie and they left any possible entrance to the barn that the Germans could check completely unprotected. Would you believe that, through radio waves and in clear English, the Captain mentioned the rank of the General, if not his name, as the person he was talking to and that the general, in plain English on the waves of open air, said that the dam had to be protected the next day? Maybe they should have sent an emissary to say which direction the American attack would come from just to make it easier for the Germans. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the 50 worst worst movies. If it were, I'm sure it would do fine. Watch it at your own risk.
