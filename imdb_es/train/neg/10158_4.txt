I could not help thinking behind the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (a hugely more amazing movie) to see this because of the realistic feeling and the great innovative idea. This could have been a great movie. The acting is ... of some of the actors well. of others ... it's downright awful. <br /> <br /> Apart from that the idea is great and the format is great. The story is also quite good, although it often suffers great blows in the logical mind. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, right? After all, it is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this version ... I really want it to be the fantastic movie that it wants to be. <br /> <br /> however (and you can not really blame the minds behind the movie for this) this obviously is based on the budget of a shoe chain. and the FX really damaged the movie in general. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if you had to change for a better performance and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> whoever wrote it should go ahead, a great idea here.
