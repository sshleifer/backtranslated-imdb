I really wanted to enjoy this movie. It moved very slowly and was simply boring. If I had been on television, it would have lasted between 15 and 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation. If this is based loosely on the director's life, why did not he get someone to see that the writing itself was "loose"? Then he directed it to the rhythm of a snail that could have been the origin of some people who fell asleep during the movie. The music is shot, but for a different movie, it's not ... possibly for the saga soap opera. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl was talking. I was not alone, because I heard some rumors about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood make better films? This had the nugget of a great story, but it was poorly executed.
