This is a complete and absolute garbage, a good example of how a movie is BAD, this can not be attractive to anyone, not even for film fans. No, I repeat, DO NOT waste the precious time of your life on this piece of garbage. Bad acting, bad direction, horrible (but I mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea of ​​what entertainment (in any way) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like serial films, murderous toys, the strange monsters of the lagoon, but this is not close. Do you know those movies that are so bad that they are fun? Not even. Just pathetic old man.
