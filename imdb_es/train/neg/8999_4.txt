Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and the SCTV alumnus are all together in a movie of sometimes funny sketches. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to see it now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of your gags have become absolutely true: there is a trailer for simulated movie, which probably was not even smart at that time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" that came true with the stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger. movie "Junior" There is a commercial parody, which probably was not even smart at that time, for something with Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling", which has now become a reality with a popular program called "Celebrity Boxing" There's a simulated movie trailer, which probably was not even smart at the time, that features John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Watch this trailer and see how similar the shots and the plot are to Frank Hellenlotter's basket! And, finally, there is an announcement of a late documentary about "a dead dream, the only two that remain ..." The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
