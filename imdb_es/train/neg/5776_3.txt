bad acting, bad accents of the south, inconsistent cinematography, horrible script ... <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see this film in a recent film festival and I got discouraged long after seeing it. It contains quotes / quote talent, but they are not delivered. Of course, the basis of this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told. <br /> <br /> Do not get upset
