I saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and I was surprised at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was fantastic as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails very badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid performance and the repeated line: "Merry Christmas to all!" Other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a story by Charles Dickens about a rich man who does not believe Christmas is anything but a hoax. After 30 minutes, the rich man is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this movie, with such a bad script that must have been written in five. minutes, it can be so well qualified. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray Scrooged comedy. That at least, it was fun ...
