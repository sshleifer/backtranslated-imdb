I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most are not great, or even good, this smoking stack lowered the bar for bad movies. <br /> <br /> The plot: I'm not sure. Something about a drug that makes you crazy and strong or something like that. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is cut scenes that come and go between people in dimly lit rooms who complain about how good the character of Mashall de Seagals is. ,,,,,, What was it with the horrible dubbing of the voice ?! Could they have found someone who looked less like Seagal? It could also be that Cheech or Chong made the voices off, at least they could have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid at all costs !!!!
