Yes, I admit that I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing, that I could not help but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First with the Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) in his program, and now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a stream of sketches from religiously oriented films. It was quite fun, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. The film follows what is known as "the code of the Bible" instead of following the actual biblical scriptures. This movie is extremely poorly made; From his writing to his address to his hilariously horrible performance. It's depressing that people really put effort into this movie. It looked more like a night movie that someone would watch on the US channel or a live video at home instead of a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend you not watch this movie, even if it's your life. it depended on it
