This movie comes as the last disappointment for me in Tsai Ming-Liang. It oozes the laziness of each one of its frames. So I'm not going to analyze it thoroughly either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is the drought, why can we see landscapes of the city with green trees in bloom? I wonder if it was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the movie (in which thirst notifies the desire for intimacy and watermelon, the trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of bad movie production, he does not give a damn about being coherent. <br /> <br /> 2. We did not know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems an unimportant question, as long as the message of supreme alienation is delivered successfully (= grandiloquent), but in retrospect, its inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical trick, a pretext? as free and exploitative as the activity in which it is used. <br /> <br /> 3. Is nothing expressed in this film that Antonioni had not expressed better 40 years ago? and without unnecessarily humiliating its actors. <br /> <br /> 4. Musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like an idea of ​​artistic counterpoint of a high school student, executed at that level of high school ability. If that was the point, the point stunk.
