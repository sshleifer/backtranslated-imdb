Have you ever had a great image in your mind that you thought it would be good to be in a movie: like watching a detective peer through the cracks of a broken fence in an abandoned house? Or to see a woman walking down a street with a cold, intense and terribly alert appearance? Yes. Imagine spreading that image to a full movie, the idea of ​​Broken came to mind, although there are no detectives in this movie, I'm just using it as a visual example. But, the intense-looking woman is here and filled almost 99% of screen time. I have nothing to complain about that woman, she is the perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open person who can enjoy all kinds of artistic expressions and I can really enjoy some really bad-tempered things. It would be great if I could frame one of the scenes in this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest, the acting is excellent. Some of the expressions on the actors' faces are what make me see. <br /> <br /> Now, in the problem of this movie. Beyond the state of mind, there is not much more here. The director basically took an obsession to an idea and took it beyond what it was worth. I do not consider it a spoiler if I say that the obsession is "mirror". Let's face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director has to work with. Of course, there are some twists and turns here and there. If you paid attention, nothing will surprise you at the end, leaving aside the obvious holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not doing anything with this style of art, since I enjoyed them most of the time. . I still believe that we should judge an artistic base in the medium that it uses to express what artists want to express. The movie is not a piece of music, not an image, not a painting, not even a poem, and it's certainly not just a great image in your mind. It is all that more a good story and the development of the character. I consider the Lynch style of cheating the movie. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave movies 2 hours running the time of the movie for a good reason. Therefore, we must judge it differently by judging a single picture of images, such as a photograph or a painting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not completely Lynch's style, thank God. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. It does not have a lot of history or character development. He appeared quite seriously with characters composed of ordinary people, therefore, he distanced himself from other fantasy things at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the element of fantasy or attempt to build a coherent world around it. The rarity came from nowhere and it seems quite isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherence remains in the head of the director, but as far as I can see, he did not try very hard to do it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did you make your effort at that moment? It seems that he made a great effort to build the mood and improve it with music. Music often builds tension that eventually becomes a mockery. Only in the back of the film, fear and tension materialized. <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt it was okay, I know what you're trying to say here, but that's the point you're trying to explain. To spend two hours accumulating all this tension? It is quite irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And they give us very little of who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that we just placed. Disappointing, but I think the director did not have much material to work and it shows.
