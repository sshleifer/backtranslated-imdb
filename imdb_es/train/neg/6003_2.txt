Sunset: with the weakest and dumb vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most improper pretentious scores ever written, and with the vampire Shane, who is so ridiculous every time he spoke was so ridiculous that I laughed half of the times and I rolled my look at the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have any special power at all, except strength (sometimes), being able to turn off a lamp with their mind (once) and ... That's it, really. Have you ever imagined that Dracula backs away worried about a fight because he ran out of bullets? Me neither. Virtually any other movie: Dracula would eat this for breakfast, skin his followers and use his bones as toothpicks. in a vampire gang fight - Dracula against some old geezer. It could have been a bit of fun with the old B-flick, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a little too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie that the clay bats still They have not ruined, the mediocre performance and the ridiculous script. <br /> <br /> In the end it's too silly to be fun. Sure, it has some fun moments, but they are few, and they are very separate.
