I saw the film when I was a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the piece of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this film would get it. The dinosaurs were horrible. The plot was ridiculous. Acting does not really qualify to be called acting. The only reason I remember the name of the movie is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was.
