This movie does not even deserve one. This was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is NO argument, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are short and even I was EXCITED to see this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt (who, by the way, received only a part of fifteen seconds). I think this could have been a mistake in the parts of directors and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only one new sentence. <br /> <br /> A film similar to this one is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing film that exists. There's no plot, and it's not funny. Although it's not about being funny. DO NOT SEE THE FILM.
