Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or continuing, but I think Europe '51 is one of the most exaggerated (and, therefore, annoying) movies I've seen. The film begins in a promising, though familiar way, since Mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled son's son (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (the insipid Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at a dinner party, the young man tries to commit suicide, setting in motion a series of life-changing events that make Bergman spend his time indulging the poor and people in need. Encouraged by the editor of the communist newspaper Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon locks her in an asylum for her problems. Bergman plays the role of saint up to the hilt, echoing her 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming to its best effect. Unfortunately, the script frees its starting point with subtlety, while Andrea and Mama take turns to declaim the common Marxist and Christian places. By the last scene soaked in tears, I had had more than the amount of these boring characters. A true step down for Rossellini to move away from neorealism and embrace even more the mythical and mystical themes of the San Francisco Flowers of 1950.
