Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds. Do I have to write eight more lines? Ana de la Reguera is fine to see, like a Mexican nun who supports the text quite advanced. rude advances of Jack Black. This movie is a PG 13 version of an independent film. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores the Mexican culture in depth. I just choked on his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary in Mexican culture, so to speak. The culture of Mexican wrestling is not the most diaphanous place that a white man, as I could look for. I suspect that Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black. presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb changed my opinion. Has anyone else changed their opinion too? Just a question.
