Not exactly my genre, this action of direct street fighting to the DVD is one that I only found because a friend put it on while we had a few beers. I have a relatively open attitude and I am a big fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat down ready to have fun. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-convict who turns into a street. fighter for unclear reasons that eventually develop as the film progresses. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> What a tedious movie. I understand that films like this do not rely much on the plot, but do they have to get involved in such a silly, predictable and stupid story? It may not be important, but it bothers me because of the gum. Better not plot and pure action than a flea mestizo loaded with clique of a narrative. Infused with a totally unfounded and infallible sentimental nonsense, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards. Probably at this point I should mention what is, of course, the drawing point of the film: the fight. Even in itself, the fight is quite poor. Bone manages to defeat the street fighters of hard, well-established men in simple blows (one or two big ones is the laughable attempt of the filmmakers to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to come to the conclusion that attacking one by one is a stupid strategy. Even this is repetitive and stupid, with broken arms and faces kicked with a constant alacrity that we can see over and over again. <br /> <br /> A cinema film by numbers that totally deserves its direct to the status of the DVD, without doing absolutely anything new and everything we have seen over and over again. And not even particularly well.
