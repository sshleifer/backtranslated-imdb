I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy with some of my favorite people: Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. Therefore, my disappointment was compounded when I discovered that the film does not work as a comedy or as a perfect theft movie. Ustinov is a petty criminal who just got out of jail and establishes his sites in a large American corporation based in London. Bluffing his way, beating stupid CEO Karl Malden and geek tech Newhart, Ustinov masquerades as a computer expert and immediately plans the "perfect hit" part of the movie. To do this, you need to have a tamper-proof security system that protects the corporate mainframe. And here is problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably confident and stupid. Your excuses are excused at first glance and this should be the only computer center anywhere that does not bother with video cameras. The second problem is that the theft (fraud in reality) occurs within the first 30 minutes of the movie, stealing the rest of the image a lot in the form of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is unfortunately a villain like Ustinov's little neighbor / secretary who simply can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she seems to be too close here, also composed, the part was asking for more of a crazy and physical comedian. Also, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as lacking in real romance as it is, is still a bit creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and at that moment it was well thought out, but it seemed a little funny, meandering and a sad loss of a great cast.
