Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy shootout between the happy couple, the exotic model of the deli and the motel veteran who was (would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and who had aged as a rental boy to the boys when they D shared the rubber house <br /> <br /> In the process, they could have flown that freezing hut to the smithereens, solving most of the inconveniences; like the ode "whore whore" in the windshield, the reason why the protagonist did not have "friends", and explained his coldness under the pressure of a tampon with blood, incessant telephone calls. . . and that elegance of the space of drag, the green thumb and its attraction for the simplest life. However, quite technical with the human body. Ex-abortionist? Assistant of the morgue? A little heartbeat would have been nice. I guess it was fun to see these people move around, but Eleanora's stupid Italian games were stiflingly stereotyped, while the caregiver had attended too many yoga classes: Dick, a mind and a van summed it up for him. I would also like them to have had a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to leave after putting some black underwear in her ingenious red suitcase and the caregiver only needs a cardboard box in the motel. <br /> <br /> Delicate things, well you can say. I agree, although the small details simply did not add up in this urgent work. However, the good fight of the owls, and I really felt cold all the time.
