Buck's role as The Kahn reminds Bob Barker (of The Price is right) to run a country in the same way he runs his show. But there is much more to laugh and snort in this turkey. Kurt Thomas, as the baby-faced "hero," shows some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a hint of acting talent at all. There are some creepy moments (in the crazy village, mostly), and some slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any "Ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment and you will not feel so guilty for laughing.
