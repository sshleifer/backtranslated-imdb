This film is considered by some as a classic, I have no idea why. It is terrible to the point of being laughable. The only saving grace with this film is the delivery of cheesy lines that are so embarrassing that they have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good songs and a good choreography in this movie, but WHAT! There is no argument, it is set in a theater without a change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressed as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie, because he said he would not believe how bad a movie can be put. He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally, with such a terrible movie, I would recommend that people not see it, but in this case I think people should do it, since it will put all the other bad movies you've seen. in perspective.
