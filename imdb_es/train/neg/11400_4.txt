The Hazing is a confused mumbo jumbo that wants to be so difficult to be The Evil Dead that even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that, simply, it is not in the same category as that excellent movie. This movie is far from original. The plot has been used before, by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and that was much more fun. This movie wastes a lot of time with a complicated exposure before taking the children to the spooky mansion and starting the demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif does not have much to do here, as always, but when he's on screen he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the performance of children, it is acceptable but in no way is it good. The unstable work of the camera is more annoying than intelligent or atmospheric. There are some good times when the first man is possessed and throws some deadly lines while dispatching his victims, but he never was afraid for a second. The gore level is medium to low, but the director tries to compensate by showing topless actresses a few times. In general, it's okay if you have 87 minutes to lose.
