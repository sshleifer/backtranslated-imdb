Decent animation and some functional character development make this animated horse fable from DreamWorks look at least ... however, it's still a bit slow and the story is a bit silly. It is interesting to see an inversion of typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it only seems a nod to political correctness rather than a correct plot decision. GRADE: C
