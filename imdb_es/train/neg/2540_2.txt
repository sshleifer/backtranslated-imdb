I thought I had seen this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other comments, and they did not agree. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study supposed sightings of big feet. I still feel pretty sure that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore, I am returning my opinion: if you like the occasional 'B' movie, like me, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you. Whether you're setting the sleep timer and leaning towards your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the silence button, and you have a fun night of improvisation. Be aware! Is the legend true? I think we could find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be some equipment malfunction at particularly key moments of the movie? Our blond, manly and young hero has hair on his chest? Will the Technicolor exceptionally high-tech last the entire movie? You will have to watch to discover it for yourself.
