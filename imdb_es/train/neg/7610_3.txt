In general, I do not like films directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is an exception) and I've never been a fan of Robert Redford either. However, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" should be good because of the amount of praise comments it has received. <br /> <br /> Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow does a beautiful job as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole thing extremely disappointing. The film, without a doubt, radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the confused plot that does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I've seen, which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can be said about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would rather watch any of Hitchcock's films five times in a row than see this waste again.
