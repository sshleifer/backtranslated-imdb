This is the worst show I've seen in years. I think he should be removed from TV because of his delay. He is so foolish that I could faint when I see him. (although I never see it because it's SOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: When Mac says he can not eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when Eddy yells at Terrance, he falls into the cage twice MORE the moment he falls, he does not fall, he falls to the side. What a stupid thing. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
