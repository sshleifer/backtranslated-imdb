Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty theft. Anyone who pays even a penny to rent any of their garbage must file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first visualization of his "work" ... and it will be the last. Ed Wood looks great with me right now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of shit to the video store, I will personally ask you to take it off the shelf. Active supporter of gay cinema, I am outraged and angry that this crooked and untalented boy-man has permission to distribute and package something like this, with a cute little boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, fortunately, not has other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis in the back used as bait, and then market it as a "movie" rental. Trust me, this does not take place on any shelf; It is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive and irresponsible trash like this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those who want to rent this because of the cover, they will be disappointed . Gabel is not as flattering to see in the film as it is on the cover, and appears once or twice without a shirt, that's all. Instead, the Mroavich inflicted on us his own disgusting and sorry nudity of boys of mass. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that he "gathered" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, throw similar sordid garbage) are terrible at this. Mraovich is presented on purpose as a complete without talent (in all fields), desperate to capture the attention of any "loser" who can by itself. He must be pitied.
