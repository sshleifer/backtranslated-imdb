When the movie started, the first 4 minutes seemed like a travel notebook from California, I wondered if I had mixed the tapes. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is spied by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about her behavior, so she hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without aspects of animals, robot games or aspects of incest. There's a good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: D +
