The television pilots, do not you love them? Quinn Martin proved this after succeeding in a lot of other TV detective films, but this one does not go anywhere except in the realm of MST to which it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, who receives orders from Aunt Mary to find the super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for the relief of ethnic comics and not much else. The tree sucks like a bad boy despite all his disguises that make him look exactly the way he normally does. Here is more unnatural fiber of clothing than you can imagine (required in the 1970s) and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not he go to the show? You find out, it's pretty shameless. Again it's fun for MST, but not much more!
