Actually, the documentary's use of the stock nature of swarming bats used by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective of all. There are shots of bats hanging from the roofs of the caves, swarms of bats flying out of the caves or spinning near the mouths of the caves. That alone is enough to be disturbing: Imagine that they all swarm after you? And in fact they are swarming in what should have been a spectacular sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark, a rather hilarious and inadequate sequence where a swarm of bats seem to attack a police car, sprinkling the windshield like bloody eggs. . The problem is that this sequence occurs about fifty minutes too late to save the film, most of which consists of one or more people running, shouting, waving their arms and talking excitedly about some poor fool who managed to be bitten by a bat. During your vacations. <br /> <br /> The fear is that you are getting angry, that it actually stinks, so your vacation is ruined, as the synopsis of the plot at the top of the BAT PEOPLE reference page indicates. outside. So here is an effective summary of the film: a young couple goes on a romantic getaway that gets ruined when a boy is bitten by a bat. They try bravely to resist him, but he starts to get angry and tries to convince those around him that it is a little more complicated than anger, that he can not control himself and that everyone should KEEP HIMSELF. <br /> <br /> Now, when someone is foaming at the mouth, covered in sweat, with bulging eyes like one of the cheaper Muppets and yelling at you to get away from Me, you get away from him. You do not try to give him drugs, you do not try to tell him that you love him, give his space to man, go home and try that scenic escape next year. <br /> <br /> But not all the people in this movie behave like imbeciles, insist on pushing the man to the edge of the situation and he turns around, mutates into a creature like man, part, bat and Kill a group of secondary characters that are not essential. There is nothing wrong with that, but the film forgets that it is a low-budget creature function and tries to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we have a lot of people running around trying to get this guy to take a pill for the cold, and eventually he runs into the hills looking a lot more human than he should, people insist on trying to chase him and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> What was most wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops, and the movie should have been about the guy AFTER they did it. Become a bat person, instead of on the trip there. It takes a good eighty minutes to really improve that aspect, with some interesting character sketches along the way that involve the always entertaining Michael Pataki as a small municipal policeman who has lost his moral advantage, and the late Paul Carr as a friendly doctor who does not he gets to receive the message. <br /> <br /> The movie is terribly boring, lasts about fifteen minutes and lost the chance to be a nice little Feature of the Creature over a crazy mutant career as the favorite of Italian horror. RATMAN, which I saw today and I was sadly inspired to try this after seeing. Me and my brilliant ideas, although the scene with the police car was a howler: Too bad we could not have had another twenty minutes of that. <br /> <br /> 3/10
