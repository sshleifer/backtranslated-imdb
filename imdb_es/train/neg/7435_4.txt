This movie (along with Rinne) are small gems among the retreaded tribute photos that have gone through the horror films so far in the 8FTDF "HorrorFest" And, yes, that's a slight compliment indeed. Because there is not much worse in cinematography than the possible authors who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the head of the Claro directors, it would have been nice if I had transferred it to the film, but this happened instead. It is a very beautiful film with some genuine fears, but the last roll is strictly for the latte sucking the film-making crowd.
