First of all, I must admit that the two films that I have seen by this director I have seen without titles and, therefore, may have lost points. My Czech is not bad, but having seen two of his films, I wish I had not tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too great It is about ten different stories that interweave and come together. That's not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (really small). The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They have jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Their feelings are repeated by immigrants here every day. That is all. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own life very much on their own. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting parts with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in the movie? If you like music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch, not an imitation. And under NO circumstances see Ondricek's movie, Septej (Whisper.) That's unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
