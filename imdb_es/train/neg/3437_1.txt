Yesterday I saw this movie. I must admit that it was not my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be a horror movie of this kind. But while I was watching this, I was thinking ... "This movie does not make any sense ..." Where the hell did this guy come with the dark coat? Where did the two guys go when they left the girls behind? Where the hell did a shark come from? <br /> <br /> All of these elements in this movie somehow did not add up. I felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a movie that was meant to be so stupid. <br /> <br /> I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the most horror movies I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I told myself that I would not see her again ... A lot of spectacle in this movie, I decided to give her the go-ahead! Tell me about this! 0 out of 10!
