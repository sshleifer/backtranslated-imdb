REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 of 5 stars) No, this is not a lost ancestor of the classic zombie movies of George A. Romero. This is a low-budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very good to audiences of the time ... but it seems terribly routine these days. Actually, there is a good scene at the beginning of a soldier firing his pistol at a horde of zombie soldiers approaching ... and a close-up of bullets entering the naked chest of one of them. The effect seems irremediably false these days, but in 1936 I'm sure the audience was out of breath. The story is about the search for the secret of mind control ... apparently to create an army of unstoppable zombies ... but later as a means for a character to win the woman he loves. The film lasts only an hour, but moves to the rhythm of a snail, so it seems to be a feature film, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... you might have fun with the fake studio photos of the star "wade" through a "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I'd say it's worth watching the movie at least once. Most likely you will see it as an additional feature in the cheap compilation of "4 movies in 1 DVD" at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's well worth the money ...
