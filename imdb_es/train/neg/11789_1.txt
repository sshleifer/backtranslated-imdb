Actually I had to stop it. Do not get me wrong, love the bad monster movies. But this one was too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never gets you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she made contact with one of the beasts, it was too obvious a clich√©. This movie totally betrays the cover on the DVD that seems quite interesting. From the cover, one expects a giant monster, but these beautiful ones are not as gigantic as the expected electric eels. I went to see another movie called The Killer Rats, but that is another criticism. Deep Shock was really shit, a great shame, since you see a pretty high budget.
