The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin. And disgusting An obese lawyer leads over the gypsy woman, and the gypsy curse makes him lose and lose weight ... to the bone. Okay, gypsy curses should be entertaining, but has the weight loss gone wrong? No Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror author and screenwriter of this abysmal film, does it too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is also fat, haha! The Thinner is like a piece of immature shit for a person who complains that he has never seen anything as unpleasant as fatness. Hey, I can only say: well, look at the mirror.
