Beautifully photographed and skillfully acted, in general, but the writing is very careless. There are scenes of such disbelief that there is no joy in observation. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so artificial that I moaned out loud. And the "bulb connection of emotion and light" also seems gruesome. <br /> <br /> Although I do not know. If you have a few glasses of wine and you want to relax with something nice to watch with some flaccid comic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No great efforts are required on the part of the viewer. But Italian cinema, especially Italian comedy, is often much, much better than this.
