There was nothing in this movie that I liked. Obviously, it was low budget with poor lighting and working with the camera (almost like Blair Witch Project, only that was not supposed to be). There really was not much in the plot, and the movie was just over and over again. In fact, I moved quickly through the last third of the films, but that did not help much. It seemed that it could be good from the point of view of the box, but I must say again: none of this movie seemed to be good. There are no good actors, the special effects were so false, the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was terribly terrible. On my own personal scale, I give this movie a 0 out of 10. Wow!
