The dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and the result of murder and chaos. The sexy and violent Milligan in his most home. Little better than a home movie (like a lot of the Milligans movies) this is a trip to the depravity style of the sixties. Notable for the copious nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor scary, and now it is more picturesque (although it is definitely classified). The film suffers because of its unequal distribution and because of the low cost of production (no one was sure where the money went in their films since it was always bankrupt). It's a bad bad movie that is not worth watching, except as a member of Milligan or because it has some attractive people having fun.
