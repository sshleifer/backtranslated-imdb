Incredibly horrible movie. I've seen part of this on TV recently. I was speechless when I observed a horribly conceived plot and heard nonsense that paralyzed my mind. Not a single line of the master of phrases could come close to producing something like a laugh. It was so bad that it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him and shout "How could you?" I know that many films are made in a hurry, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of a particular actor or subject. But, please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It is sad and terrifying that people were expected to pay to see those guts. The bottom of the well, even by Sunday afternoon television standards.
