I entered this movie hoping for the best. I like war musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; However, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love interest between the two did not receive any real growth; Suddenly I was there. I did not like music very much; the best number was the fragment we heard from Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". The only complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; Quite mild things, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite attractive and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on the screen.
