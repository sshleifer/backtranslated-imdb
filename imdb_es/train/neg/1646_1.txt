I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. The performance was not very good, but that was not the real problem. The problem was the sinking feeling I had in the pit of my stomach 20 minutes into the movie. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and what little they had was dedicated to the cruelty that they manifested to each other in the form of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you must give those characters real personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the image they gave was simply ugly.
