The reason why this movie is so bad is because it is so poorly written, and this is entirely the fault of the novelist Robert James Waller, also the author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. An unsuccessful couple, a blocked American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history she is ashamed of are swept away by a strong and self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly horribly violent) that alternate with scenes that show the warmer side of the murderer, leaves the impotent partner for the murderer, who, however bad it is, sees it more clearly than anyone else. Nothing can help this film succeed, not even the face of Scott Glenn as the murderer, or the sexy Latinity of Giovanna Zacarias as Luz, nor the unconditional performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track down the killer. A serious waste of time.
