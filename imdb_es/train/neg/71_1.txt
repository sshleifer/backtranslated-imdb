This movie was so relentlessly bad that I could hardly believe I was watching it. The direction, the editing, the production and the script seemed to have been made by high school students who do not know much about movies. There was not a narrative flow that made any kind of sense. The great emotional moments and the highlights (as one at the beginning between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the relationships of the characters (like the one that was insinuated at the beginning) come out of nowhere and are not configured as if they had been one more elegant way. and indeed made cinema. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, which makes it difficult for us to have some kind of connection with them. The performance, surprisingly, is not all bad, but the terrible writing cancels the relatively convincing performances. The film is presented as a particularly bad western / epic television movie, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story it tries to tell. I have read many reviews that defend that the film is important for Australians because of the subject. That's fine, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOES NOT MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the issue is not good, just the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for the Americans, but that does not mean that I will defend the film and say that it was good, because it was still bad. A failure everywhere, although Heath and Orlando are lovely to watch.
