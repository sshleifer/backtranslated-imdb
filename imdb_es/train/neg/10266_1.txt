1ยบ seen on 07/11/2004 - 1 of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): exaggerated repetition of the alleged horror films of the 70s as on Friday 13 (versions 1 to whatever ??). I can not think much about redeeming here except (or can I think of something?) The story revolves around a group of stupid people who listen to a radio show a year after some children were killed in the woods as a "tribute" . to this, supposedly. But, behold, one of the stupid people has connections to the real event because his sister was one of the murdered ones (once again, it is stupid that she is part of this). Guess what? The killer is in that again and they tell us from the beginning who he is (so there is no mystery at all). And besides all this, where are the "policemen" and why do not somebody call them? I can not believe that this movie was funded by someone and done. You would think that at this point the American people would be judged a little higher, at least in their experience of going to the movies, but not by this filmmaker.
