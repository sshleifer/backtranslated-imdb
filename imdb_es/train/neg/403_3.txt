Another violent and angry fantasy of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is an enigma: it is difficult to know if he takes his deaf impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. It also seems to completely ignore the fact that all the brilliant images in the world (and this has some of the most prominent ones) can not hide a neglect of history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to lead to moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a sympathetic actor who occasionally shows his dark side ('The River Wild') in an attempt to counter his youthful appearance; Given the material, however, Bacon is not hateful enough to force it. The other directors are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom is talented enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to perform idle dialogues, are embarrassed. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief must be truly suspended.
