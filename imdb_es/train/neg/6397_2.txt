That is a problem I have with the movies that appear on television, when there is nothing more to see. Somehow I got caught up in really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was quite visible. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after a comet, and then discovering that there are zombies nearby, makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way that makes you laugh (too stupid> fun). <br /> <br /> I think I only saw her because the Star Trek guy was the protagonist. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
