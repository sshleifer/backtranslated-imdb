I recently saw the Broadway revival of "Blithe Spirit," starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It is an excellent production and shows what good actors can do with a work that is not perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake, then, to see the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison. The film does not have the energy or laughter of a good theatrical production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those works that works best with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have a laugh The actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involving the audience on a personal level that can not be obtained in a movie theater, or with a DVD sample, where the audience is separated from the public. Story of the "Fourth Wall". The story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the English countryside. In search of information for his next book, a book on the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, repeating her role of the original London production of 1941), a local spiritual medium, to her home to lead a session of spiritism. Charles believes that spiritism is a farce, but hopes to learn "the tricks of the trade." But then Madame Arcati retrieves the ghost of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), Charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops a rivalry with Ruth over Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage, actors can give performances that invite to laugh at this. situation. But on the screen, the actors of "Blithe Spirit" break the lines as if they did not know that someone is listening to them. They mutter lines that were designed to get laughs on stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and her humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning visual effects in the film are not impressive, not only by today's standards, but by the 1946 standards! They consist mainly of Kaye Hammond walking in fluorescent green clothes and makeup, photographed with special lighting to make her look like a bright ghost. <br /> <br /> The director of photography deserves some credit for creative lighting. But compare the boring visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" with the truly innovative effects of Disney's "Song of the South," which were eligible for the awards the same year. In "Sur", humans and animated characters share the screen perfectly for minutes at a time. Compared to "South", the Oscar that received "Blithe Spirit" for special effects was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can only encourage you to see the Broadway resurgence of this play with Angela Lansbury before. close As for the movie with Rex Harrison, skip it.
