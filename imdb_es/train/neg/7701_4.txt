The original show was much better. They should have left it on a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, too dramatic, and the funny parts were too far away to make up for the slack. This movie really looked like it was trying too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention that for a long time it was just depressing for the same thing over and over again. Then, I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try next time. This movie is a bit boring, and it's not that funny either. Sorry. 4/10 stars is. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
