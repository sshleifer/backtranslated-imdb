I may have seen worse movies than this, but if I do, I do not remember. Or possibly blocked them. Who knows, if I had to undergo hypnotherapy, I might remember them, perhaps, as kidnapped by aliens when they were children or other traumas. If so, I would happily exchange those memories for which I have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give the film some credit: it produced an emotional response. In fact, I started to get angry with scenes that falsified other movies and TV shows, that this parody was messing them up by association. I'm terrified I can not watch movies like Dr. Strangelove again without this movie fluttering in my mind.
