This movie really is about hard. If you're going to make a horror movie, at least give it a reason to believe in hooking the viewer. <br /> <br /> you wait and wait through the movie waiting for a great explanation, but it is not like that. instead, try to be too intelligent an ending and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? Where is it really going? and more important, what the hell was happening. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how does it relate to something? Just another weak science fiction horror. I love the false reviews in IMDb that say how wonderful the press releases related to the film are (either that or people have low horizons). It's not worth its 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than the fragile, but at least that gave reason and why things happened and has a final result. This is not the case and it is simply prepared with tons of stuffing so that everything feels terrifying. This movie is as low as when a stranger calls. God who was lame too. <br /> <br /> Great advice, if you are going to make a horror, make it credible with the reasoning and explain to the viewer what is happening, so that they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reasoning or credibility, then there is no firm control over anything and it can not be scary. without disrespecting the cast or team because they did a good job. It's just poor writing.
