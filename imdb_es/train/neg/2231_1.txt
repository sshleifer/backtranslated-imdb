All I can say after seeing Snitch'd is to stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what you are making movies about. If you insist on making movies about gang members, I urge you to investigate. It is funny to see movies with absurd gangsters that even sound more absurd when they speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick his butt in the kung. fashion of fu. This movie was tough as a special after school. Who had the idea of ​​wearing hats that say where a particular gang member was from? I suspect that true gang members do not wear hats that say there are gangs. That would be stupid if new laws that add duration to a prison term were considered if a person is gang-related. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangster movie ever made.
