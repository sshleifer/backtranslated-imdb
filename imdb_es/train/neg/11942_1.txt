Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and only deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is unfortunately a bad role in a role of Lolita and Leo Grillo has great skill with what is essentially a cardboard character cut out. The only cast member with enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who ruins him as a villain and despairs completely with his role. The script is serious, the acting is horrible and it has big enough holes to go through a double-decker bus. It's also the sexiest movie I've seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely unfriendly. She is seen as an evil and seductive seductress who attracts the poor and innocent married man to cheat on his wife. Throughout the film it is implicit that she is a minor, and the message that accompanies that plot only sends the belief! In the end, he is not even able to redeem himself by firing at the man who obviously (ha!) Has gone mad with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to commit suicide, redeeming himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
