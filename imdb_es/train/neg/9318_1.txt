This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. Once again, I made the mistake of buying the film because the synapse on the back sounded good and the cover also looked very good (after buying this and the movie "Malevolence", which I reviewed here as well, I learned my lesson) . I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly happens in the Texas forest, but it was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the worst. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another "mom and dad" store that buys used DVDs and none would accept it. That's how horrible this poor miserable excuse was for a movie. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2, for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I did not think there was a movie worse than "Troll 2". Boy was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free, but even if you get stuck with it, unless you throw it away, that's what I'm going to do!
