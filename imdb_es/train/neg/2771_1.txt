The film was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the story writer simply does not hold water. Definitely missing something. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they see it, apart from the historical vision of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we look for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie simply lacks substance. The only way to make this movie correctly was to somehow make changes in which it resembles a kind of legend rather than a story. And a legend will have certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie fails to answer, why would I see it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some strange legendary flying elephants, psychic king or eccentric king like "The King and I" would have been beautiful, something would have added much to the appeal of cinema. I guess there was no more attractive than a simple vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> Once you got the appeal, then the story is the next thing we concentrate on. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see". Upon hearing the title of the film, people would say, "Oh, I must see it." Now, where is the appeal at Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it "How NOT to be a king?" and make a black comedy from the old Siamese days, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove". That would have been much more interesting. The experiences similar to the narratives of the weaknesses of the king of the first foolish people would have made the film extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have that "must see" appeal, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, some other films, such as The Island, had an appeal when the public asked "Do you still think there is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or for the film, entitled "How NOT to be a king" could ask the question: "So, DO YOU WANT to still be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
