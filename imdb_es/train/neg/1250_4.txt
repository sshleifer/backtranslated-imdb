I must admit that this "reimagining" of the original film of 1968 was a great disappointment. Especially when you consider that this is a Tim Burton movie. It is definitely one of the most original and, I might say, the great directors that Hollywood has produced. <br /> <br /> I am personally a big fan of your work, but obviously something went wrong with your latest movie, The Planet of the Monkeys. I really enjoyed the original movie. When it first came out, people expected only another cheezie 70 sci-fi movie, but a surprise very and totally proved that the theory was wrong. In fact, I had a clear message. An obvious message against the war. The fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and the fear of the use of nuclear weapons, played an important role in the minds of the filmmakers. Those reasons made the film exceed all expectations and became an instant classic. Although, the new movie, the "reissue" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideal behind that. It's just another summer box office hit with money mindset. <br /> <br /> Visually Tim Burton does not disappoint you. The dark and spooky scenes were excellent and, of course, the makeup was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Obviously, that's not enough to keep people interested in a movie. There must be an exciting plot or argument. In this film, the plot is very uninteresting and is extremely poorly thought out. The script is very sparse and full of holes. It seems that this movie had been written in a hurry. The explanation of why the apes were there and why he ruled the planet was really very stupid and proved the ignorance of the writers. <br /> <br /> Many questions arose, which did not have reasonable answers. <br /> <br /> For example; Why did the monkeys speak in English? Why were there other species of apes besides the chimpanzees on the planet (since there were only chimpanzees in the spacecraft that crashed on the planet)? Where the hell did all those humans come from? How could a few chimpanzees become a huge increase in all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years? (I mean it took us a few million years to evolve from monkey to man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the end of the bad surprise was just stupid. It was probably only introduced because the original movie had such an ending, so they felt that the audience expected the same kind of ending. The ending also raises many questions, that I KNOW, I do not have intelligent answers. Did Theid learn to work on the spacecraft, which had no power, and learned to fly in time and seize the earth with one hand? And, what did he do, grow up with all the women? And let's say that would happen, I doubt very much that the story remains the same, as if Washington were built exactly as it is today! (I mean, should not there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something positive about the movie. Some of the cast was great. The character of Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well acted, in terms of Tim Roth as Theid. It was very good, a bit exaturated in some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not a great actor, and here he plays a character without a very macho color. Very unaffordable and is nothing compared to the character of Hestons in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the movie. She has just been cast by the looks. Hardly said a word throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I think that in the future, when people think of Planet of the Apes, they will think of the original. The last will soon be forgotten.
