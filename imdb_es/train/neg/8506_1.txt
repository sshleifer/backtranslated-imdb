This may be the worst movie I've seen in my life. Inconsistent would be a compliment. Even the ending did not make sense, but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. I watched him with a sort of fatalistic fascination to see if he could continue to deteriorate and he did. At the end of this disaster, I regretted that some of the characters survived and I did not feel very charitable with the actors either. If you want to see a train crash, I recommend hanging out at a train station. Even waiting on a deserted train platform overcomes this mess. Apparently, I have not downloaded enough to fill my ten prescribed lines, so, at the risk of redundancy, I'll say it one more time. This movie is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
