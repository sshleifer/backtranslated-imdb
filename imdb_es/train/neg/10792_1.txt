This movie does not offer more than the dumbest conversations possible. In fact, it is very likely that I did not imagine how meaningless a film would be, how synthetic the dialogues could be until an hour ago, but again I saw this video. In a film that does not depend on a powerful script, one expects to see at least good performances and tasty conversations and even some humor, although this movie lacks all of them. You heard me that he lacks all. There is not a single point that I like about this movie, none. I hate it. I'm sure someone will too. the name is meant to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and those things, but it fails even in nudity. I do not know how, but I dared to see this for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend that you do not. The worst movie I've seen in my entire life. If someone offers to see you, wait for what you want. Save your life
