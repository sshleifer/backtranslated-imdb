It has Christopher Lee, it has huge banks of computers from the 1970s that make Teletype noises appear when letters appear on the screen, it has radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the darkness but emit pulsating noises, it has volcanoes! Evil aliens disguised as nuns! Tsunamis! Tremors! cars exploding! coffee machines exploding! and as a climax the whole planet explodes. How the hell did this movie manage to be so incredibly, insensibly silly? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of this movie is made up of shots, most of them with long, panoramic tracks or close-ups in combination, or sometimes all three, that do nothing, except that they give something to the team. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, going up and down the cars, driving again, walking around looking at things, getting in cars and driving ... I sat watching the endless parade of the nothingness in the stupefying murmuring "Say something, please someone, just say something ... DO something ... whatever! ... "<br /> <br /> The dialogue, when it arrives, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe your minutes are measured on a scale different from ours". It was a typically pointless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by archival images, justified in this speech by Lee as the main foreigner: <br /> <br /> "The planet Earth has emitted an excess of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. planets a light years from here will suffer unless they are destroyed! "<br /> <br /> This is a writing of Neanderthal SF. This is the kind of motivation found in the 1950 Japanese monster movie type aimed at 7 year olds. It's, and I collect those things, the scariest line in an English SF movie since Buster Crabbe left. We believe that this movie premiered the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who always seemed to me an intelligent and useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, offers his lines. As if he were going to kill his agent for putting him in this pile of drek. I do not blame him.
