I took the opportunity to see this movie without cuts and without interruptions, remembering rahs and raves for her. But where it looked like it was going to be really scary, he stepped back and went somewhere else. The water that dripped all over the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, the wrong turns in the sewage were dropped before they could scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost expressionless face mask offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself reflecting as the film progressed. What might have been the strange aboriginal chant and background instruments was, instead, a cacophony seemingly designed to strike terror in the head. The ideas that modern people can embody the ancient gods, that aboriginal peoples believe that red-haired white men were the first priests, and that many other possibilities are conveyed more as a shopping list than as an indication of another dimension (the Time of Dreams). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, it was not clear to me what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? And that? How big? A tsunami? Yes, okay. That is devastating but not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? Of a wave? The last wave? That would have to be a pretty big wave. Why? Was the world so bad a place? It did not seem so horrible in this movie. I did not really think that the wave would come off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been projected by the wave. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Hell, that happens every day to people who lose it. He had no interest if it was only him. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton has gone to confront the old man. Man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him "Who are you?" and it becomes really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed his example.
