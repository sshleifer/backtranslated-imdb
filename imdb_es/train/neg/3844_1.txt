First of all, I would like to tell everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is an excellent actor, although he does not say so. Much about his filmography, he has been in several plays and musicals. Currently resides in the Terrace B.C. that's where I'm from, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Well, now about the film, I would not recommend this to anyone who has NOT seen it, since it's not a movie worth seeing, La Main reason why I thought it was a bad movie is that it never stays in its place, it keeps bouncing between the times, making it a bit difficult to follow at some points, and second, it's really boring * laughs * Although the performance It's excellent, The movie just does not compare.
