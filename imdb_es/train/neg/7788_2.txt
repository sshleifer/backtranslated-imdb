I've noticed that all the other reviews in this movie mention how "healthy" and "entertaining" it is. These people need to leave the house more often. I do not know why they are throwing off this insipid, insipid and brainless fuzz. Pat Boone has absolutely no talent to act, and his ineptitude is surpassed only by that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (one more reason to ban the insidious practice of inflicting models without talent in an unsuspecting and unsuspecting public). habit that unfortunately persists to this day). A good cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) strives to make sense of this, but to no avail. I noticed that two directors shared credit, although "credit" is not the word I would use (none is "director"). As for "healthy entertainment," there are many of those types of movies available without torturing their loved ones by forcing them to go through this. Find one of those movies, and jump this one.
