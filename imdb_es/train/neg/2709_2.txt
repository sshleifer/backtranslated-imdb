The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in that light, it is delivered. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a superficial and one-dimensional examination of "problems" without any idea. <br /> <br /> Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely bad strategy, especially when those same characters only break their molds in a predictable and stereotyped way. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost visible, and Michael Rappaport has a good presentation, but the script is so horrible and the social commentary is so trite that it is difficult to find something that redeems.
