WHITE CHICKS Wait, why could not they dress like Black Chicks? Oh, yes, they would not look different at all. Can someone give me a Wayans movie in which they have not disguised as ladies? Do not Be A Menace does not count, Jack White and the ghost of Michael Costanza wrote that (the other members of Norton Trio acted as directors). <br /> <br /> At White Chicks, there are never really jokes. It's just the Wayans acting as girls for 2 hours. There are no configurations, no punchlines and no laughter. There's a lot of "I think I'm going to play some Time Crisis 3". At least for me there were (5 times to be exact). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. It only affects the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * of ****
