I saw it on a weekend afternoon, since there was simply nothing else on, it would have been more entertaining to chew me and probably less painful. I urge everyone to see this just to see how horrible a movie can be, it was surely deliberate. I shuddered at each futile attempt at humor made in such a childish, untested, poorly executed way that it was impossible to believe. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, do you think I'm exaggerating? Well, give the air time and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If this was not a joke, then the director and any other person responsible for this should be eliminated and shot immediately after being forced to watch this movie again.
