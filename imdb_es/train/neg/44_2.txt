I'm not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this as an unpleasant video or the director ... "Devil Hunter" is a strange "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a lazy combo. Of superior films like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". Chick is kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages'. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around with Halloween costume costumes in the style of Party City. And the savages vary in race from white to Asian, black and Hispanic. I guess Franco just grabbed anyone who looked a little ethnic for this game. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie has an ultra-minimal blood, without real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. It's not fun I can find something that I like in almost any Italian movie or Euro trash of poor quality; This one was very short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
