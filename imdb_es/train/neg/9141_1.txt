Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was someone thinking that was involved in this "movie" thinking? Mraovich is the boss of almost everything of "Ben and Arthur": director, writer, producer (also producer EXECUTIVE!), Launcher, main star; whatever, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has sucked in all departments of film making. <br /> <br /> So, what's wrong with this movie? All. The film is about two homosexual lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- * moan *). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates homosexual people. To make matters worse, the crazy "ex-wife" of Ben (who does not divorce exactly), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is going crazy that Ben has left her for another man and demands Ben to be together again ( saying that she can be gay, too!) and Arthur's Christian, devout, excessively hypocritical, just as crazy as Tammy's brother, Victor, insists on getting Arthur to stand up straight and then try to kill him after he kick out of your church. <br /> <br /> The film is absolutely full of blockages with so many mistakes (ie, Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married, go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees, return on a FedEx cargo plane, I hope they have done it). comfortable in a wooden box, plus many, many more) and draw holes to boot (Victor says he killed Arthur "The Final Plan", which then changes to "The Final Deed", Arthur and the private detective (internal) they drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). The "actors" are all very bad and are far above; the script is ridiculously horrible (an example is "I do not make sense, it does not make sense, I make sense, that's what makes sense!") and there is much more wrong with the "movie" that I can not write them all. <br /> <br /> However, the most ridiculous and incredible thing about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraovich believes he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for "Ben & Arthur" and the obvious comments from him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance prevents him from seeing how horrible his name is. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, forget about every bad movie that says it's the worst movie in history. "Ben and Arthur" will eliminate them from that title, even the Paris Hilton movies look like " The Dark Knight "compared to the monstrosity known as" Ben and Arthur ".
