I had never heard of this, then discovered that it was the man with the deadly lens, of whom I had heard but had not seen. The presence of Connery led me to buy it, and it's not good. It wants to be a kind of cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mash, but it's not that funny, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It is presented as a thriller from the 70 until the last ten minutes, when it comes to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his aides that do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was reduced to reach the whole rescue plot of a nuclear bomb and suicide bombings, which I think are meant to be played to laugh, but again, they are not. that's funny The location of the shoot is excellent, but the things in the studio look like cheap television. I could not believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Just laugh: Connery pulls his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of an airplane. It makes you never say Never you will look like a genius again.
