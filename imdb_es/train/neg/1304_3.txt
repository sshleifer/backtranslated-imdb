Very low budget police film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appears in a stolen car in Central Park, and her only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although it was released by RKO, it has the appearance of an independent production that was collected by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with some exceptions, including a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner, are made up of complete strangers, and it shows. The performances are universally inferior to the average and would not be approved in a high school training film, the direction is heavy and choppy and, as mentioned above, there is no chemistry among the main actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it has some good points. Filming in New York City and the movie's ultra-low budget give it a rough authenticity much like that of the much higher "The Naked City," a shooting in a dark basement is handled decently and some of the procedures of Research are smart Otherwise, there is not much to tell. However, it is worth taking a look at the most beautiful sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and fans of vintage cars will be delighted to see the legions of cars of the 30s and 40s on the streets. <Br /> <br />.
