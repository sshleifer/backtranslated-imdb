Scary .. Yes Scary !! Filled with nudity (from fat people to thin people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie two years ago, it is safe to say that it became a strange topic of discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy, just a nude show! This movie reached its lowest point with one of the new age characters looking down between the legs of a girl. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found heaven. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this, unless you want to listen to amateur actors who discuss issues like farting, adultery and the process of overlaying the genitals. AVOID!
