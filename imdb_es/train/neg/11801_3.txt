As a big fan of the original movie, it is difficult to see this show. The chillona set decoration and the sets with severe lighting steal any style of this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the appearance of so many television movies of the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice like Walter Neff, but his elegant wardrobe and his "swank" apartment do not conform to the style of the original, nor make him an interesting character. He does everything he can to make it work, but Samantha Egger is a bad choice. The English accent and the appearance of California can not contain a candle for the velvet voice and the sexual attractiveness of Barbara Stanwick. Lee J. Bobbb tries powerfully Barton Keyes fashion, but even his performance is abrupt, without style. <br /> <br /> It feels like the television movie it was and it reminds me once again how extraordinary the original movie is. is.
