This apology for a movie is absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed the money. The film must have been done with a very low budget, because the lighting did not exist. I made a promise if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor or commit suicide. I would love to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. What I regret most is to waste time watching this garbage.
