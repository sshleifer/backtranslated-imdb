The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is not surprising that this film has received the accolades it received. Al Gore is certainly an actor. It sounds so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there are political details and references to his political career throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only speaks, but walks the path. as well. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he turned off the White House thermostat and warmed up with a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and says that we are creating Global warming while he travels in his own private jet. How much energy does your jet use and how much more pollution does your jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the electric company would react to a 50% reduction in energy, calling it a "50% loss in revenues" and recovering its losses by raising rates by 50%. Therefore, "simply turning it off" would not be a good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, on behalf of the saved planet, that is.
