First: I bought it in the video store. Second: I saw it. Third: it was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of the antics were lame. And last but not least: it's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry because it was his first movie. Even if you're a huge Adam Sandler fan, do not bother watching this movie. Instead, simply take the video, board a yacht and throw it over the side.
