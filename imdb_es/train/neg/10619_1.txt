... but a terrible movie. As Maltin says, this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror movie. Well, it's serious ... VERY serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about the elderly people who inhabit the bodies of young children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all a conversation, a conversation, a conversation, a talk about the same things over and over time. In fact, I fell asleep a couple of times! The movie is incredibly boring! The cast walks asleep through this with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a love job for both of them (they often complained that the horror movies were too violent ... well, this DOES NOT have violence!). Avoid it at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you to sleep!
