This program bothers me! There's no humor for that and it's too serious to call it "fun"! It's too educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotyped and unattractive. The frames are redundant and the moral is repeated again and again. Where is the fun? I also feel that this has been on the BBC for too long and is being broadcast too much. Do you really need to have a T.V space every 2 or 3 months when a new program runs out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to bring back some of their older programs such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula, in addition to continually contracting these new shows! I thought the BBC was bringing Danger Mouse back, what's going on with that ?! 3/10
