This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be cruel and shocking; but FEEDING THE MASSES is lame as some of the zombies with stiff legs lurking the streets. In Rhode Island, the newspaper manipulated by the government and television stations are controlling an epidemic of zombies known as the Lazarus Virus. A pair of brave but foolish souls of Channel 5 TV News feel that their public is giving false hope and they have no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An enthusiastic journalist (Racheal Morris) and his cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk their lives and limbs to present a live broadcast to show the current fate. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This is, obviously, a very low budget and presents with the feeling that a secondary work has gone wrong. Acting is atrocious and meat-hungry zombies are almost comical. They also appear: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FEED THE MASSES should be left to starve.
