Defeating the bad guys ... Again it's the slogan of this movie, which exposes a lot of truth about it. <br /> <br /> Alone at home, one and two, movie classics. Only at home three and four, a good movie if you have three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, no matter how hard you try to be fun, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very insipid actor with vapid performances, but it is not entirely his fault, the writing demands an insipid vocabulary and insipid expressions. The jokes are copied from the first two with different thieves, and you would have to be blind to think that chicken pox is real. A good option if you are a preschool teacher in which this movie is shown on a rainy day. And to make matters worse, a totally different cast, go see if you do not believe me, but you will regret it.
