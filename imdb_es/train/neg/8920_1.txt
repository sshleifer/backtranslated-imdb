... but this has to be the worst adaptation of A Christmas Carol of all time. And that requires a little work, what happens with the likes of several lifelong efforts. Do not get me wrong, I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I've enjoyed it tremendously in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script does not give you any choice but to chew the stage. And chew what he does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tied to a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of Scrooged, all others are simply exaggerated efforts to capture the past, present or future of Spirit of Christmas.
