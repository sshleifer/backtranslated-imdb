Very well, I recently had the opportunity to rent this and see Santa Claus conquer the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish task in Spanish 5 we all had to see it. I'll tell you that, usually, when we watch a movie, we're all talking and eating, but not for this movie. Everyone stood with their mouths open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch would do next. Would Merlin help Santa? Or would your robot reindeer come to save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest garbage I have seen and I love it for that. :RE
