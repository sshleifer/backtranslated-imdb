This film is simply too long, too repetitive, with male nudity and sexuality (as it is said as a gay with my own collection of titles for adults) too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been reduced to ten minutes and have been just as effective without testing the patience (and endurance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on an early Saturday afternoon. , with a public of film festival; The type of audience that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialogue, short films, foreign films. The almost sold-out crowd in a theater of approximately 275 seats began to dribble in the first half of the film and although the vast majority stayed for the "payment" (which never really arrived), never, in about 14 years of attending Any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, has seen a lot of people move away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been reduced by more than half and be as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, even with a shorter execution time, and have been much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, this is not something that one can easily recommend or one would have. I want to look again.
