In the autobiographical account of the coming of age "Romulus, My Father", Eric Bana, of the fame of "Munich", plays an impoverished German émigré who struggles to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in Rural Australia in the 1960s. The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her marriage vows by having to confront shamelessly with other men. Despite his unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant him a divorce, torturing himself masochistically with the vain hope that he will one day return with him. Unfortunately, it is Raimond, good-hearted and kindhearted, who must witness all this marital turmoil, and it is his memories that serve as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita would later become an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulo, my father" for what he is trying to do, I can not honestly say that I enjoyed it, since the film has some good performances and great intentions. , these simply are not enough to counteract the bitter plot and the funeral rhythm, which leave the audience as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious series of life dramas is one thing, but this tireless pace of adultery, insanity, and multiple suicides (let alone suicide attempts) is another matter.
