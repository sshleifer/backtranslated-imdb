I was one of the few non-liberals who appeared to watch Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in film propaganda and boredom. <br /> <br /> I expected the film to be a real documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to hit the conservatives and the local religious community . It seems certain that for a filmmaker it is self-sufficient to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceived ideas about the themes. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising is to see all the '10' votes your parents have posted here. Did you even watch the video? Golly gee Batman, this must be between all the president's men! His grades are as obvious as the bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, how to stack votes in IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote helps balance this.
