Stalker is right! The girl sees the boy, the girl loves the boy, the girl creates mundane ways to keep tripping over him, the girl does not leave him alone, the girl pretends to be patient, the girl can not stop talking about him, the girl pretends to love to another man (or two), he does not pay attention because she is upset, the girl STILL will not leave him alone. Played well, Drake's character might have been charming, but he's total, relentless in his quest for Cary Grant's character, his girlfriend is bored and, unfortunately, Drake's attempt to play, "charmingly" is like "disturbingly" crazy ". Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary, but it's the closest thing to a phone performance I've seen of him. The management is mediocre and the dialogue is simply tenuous. <br /> <br /> The Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, as in this collision attempt, it just sucks. Worse yet, Drake spends the entire film on the need for a large amount of Valium and a restraining order. She ruins all the humor found in this relic of mummies dust drier.
