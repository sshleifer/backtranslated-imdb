There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same inexplicable drawing as a car accident, and there are others like "Desperate Life" that you hate to admit your love. Cowgirls do not have none of these redemptions. The assembled cast has enough talent to make it possible to see almost any plot, and from what I have been told, the book is nice. <br /> <br /> How could this movie be so intolerably bad? For starters, it seems that the director gathered a cast of names with no other tie than the one he will bring in his twenties. Then tell them to do their best imitations of Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page, making sure to keep large expanses of the United States from being interesting in any way. Finally, give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meatpacking plant just fired him. He has twenty years of experience in the cut. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not even good for being bad.
