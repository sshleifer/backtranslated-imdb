Someone had a great idea: Let Misty Mundae make her own version of Lara Croft, classified by R, who shoots two weapons not only in small suits, but also in topless. It was really a great idea. The problem is that the people who had it could not present any type of script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "film" that barely reaches an average length when playing many of its parts (often in slow motion), and apparently it was completely filmed inside a garage. The appeal of Misty Mundae is still evident: she is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty of girl next door. However, his two co-stars here, with whom he shares a long lesbian scene, are not close to his league. If "Mummy Raider" is presented as a Youtube video, I would rate it as higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD consumption you can not get more than 1/2 to * of 4.
