If at least cruelty and prolonged deaths had a purpose in history to justify their inclusion, but the script was simply unintelligible and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> I was not going anywhere, the story did not have a legible continuity. It was just a handful of pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid ending to say ... "the end * beep *, my enemies and my few defenders to see my trash." <br /> <br /> I do not understand, a masked assassin who was never removed from his mask in prison, a rape scene in prison that was supposed to be the guards raping an ugly and deformed serial killer and being killed for him and nothing more. no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main police character that was a waste of an actor like Pare, who did not try to get rid of the guy who killed his cops, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and sent them to him to you to watch on video. <br /> <br /> Policemen who, for some unknown reason, all wandered in the dark alone (individually) in their country house at night as a group of badly written teenage characters to kill them at one time as a group of idiots, and no other policeman listens to them die in the dark, one after the other, and keeps wandering around for no reason until everyone dies in turn. <br /> <br /> At first, a lot of horrible snuff scenes of real life animals without any reason or explanation, remember, I saw him to masturbate, it was a comedy for him ... what was it? No, Boll just thought about throwing it to annoy animal lovers ... whatever. <br /> <br /> Then stop believing the word of a psychic way to let go of your family if you commit suicide ... a more credulous and stupider policeman than you ever saw in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to totally hate your works. I try to find some reason to explain the art of a horror writer, but these things ... pure shit. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing now? I hope you discover it because I know many more deserving people who can not dream of getting the budget you get over and over again to make their films. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Boll at his best "Postal" outing, it was actually fine.
