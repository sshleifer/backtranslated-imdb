Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This movie does not have enough plot for half an hour, however, they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this unfortunate thing that it would be better to leave undone.
