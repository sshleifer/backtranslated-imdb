After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It just was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas portrayed it. Perhaps he recognized how poor the plot was: Jim returns after a prolonged absence, to find Jessica being chased by another man. He could not wait for any girl to wait so long without contact with him, and he would not find competition. For a Disney movie, this contains obscene language, plus the unnecessary part when Jim and Jessica put on the strap without being married, very LAME. All an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, according to the members of my family. I stay with the first one and try to forget that I once saw the sequel.
