Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Wrong, exaggerated, and simply silly. That said ... it's actually a nice movie on some level. This film asks to be seen in a group with a wide offer of cheap beer. It's one of those films like "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, the hunter of the future" ... so bad that it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a wonder to watch. It's campy. It's fun. It has a Sousa theme. However, if you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> By the way, I heard rumors that some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake ...
