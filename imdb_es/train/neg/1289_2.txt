This was a new historical minimum among the Westerns. The writing is unbearably bad, the characters are impossible to emphasize and are disgusting or soft, the violence is frightening and technically is not very convincing. And Tobey Maguire shows us the other side of his talent, somnambulism through his part with those inexpressive eyes and his hoarse voice that here alone betrays the mannerism. 'Ride With the Devil' is among my five worst cinematic experiences, a western that will never be outdone in negative respect.
