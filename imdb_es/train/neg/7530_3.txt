I found this film boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hasty and superficial "optimistic" ending that did not sound true to the general story. Following these characters through a weekend of horrible events, hostile attitudes and bad news is not just my idea of ​​an interesting and interesting film, and I got really tired of their "one note" theme and I could not wait for that it would end ... in fact I almost stopped halfway. The whole movie seemed useless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, although the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and a small appeal. I'm sorry, but he did not get it with me, and I love good little movies. This simply did not curdle, although I kept seeing him waiting and trusting that he would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Top 10" list of the year. Instead, I recommend seeing "The Sand House": now there's a good little movie!
