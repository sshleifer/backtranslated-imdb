Why every director of terror wants to imitate "The exorcist" is a complete enigma for me, since the "classic" by William Friedkin is a film very overrated and, in my opinion, is not so tense or shocking. And yet, here is another clean scam, one in Spanish this time, that blatantly repeats the story of a young girl who is possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks pretty sexy here) plays the honorable priest John Gibson approaches because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since he met his new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with a crooked neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... The "exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, it is also an unbearably boring movie! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had the opportunity to make a religious-themed exploitation film full of beatings and blood, and yet the result is a domesticated and widespread drama that will almost make you sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, although very stupid, and there are quite a few sordid and feminine nudes filmed with style. Absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse, since Paul Naschy has already shown that he has enough imagination to compensate for the shortage of money. This is just a horrible movie, end of story. Other European scams of "The Exorcist" are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they also suck!
