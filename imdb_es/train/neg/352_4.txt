It seems that the cast must secure at least an average movie. And so I sat for 102 minutes of disbelief. Along with Ed Harris, no one seems to possess the acting skills. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually love, must have had a day off during the entire shooting of Just Case. Not once during the whole movie could an actor convince me. <br /> <br /> This made this movie seem cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story gets a bit complicated. It's exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion just look at this movie if you really do not have anything more useful to do.
