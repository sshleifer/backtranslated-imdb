This movie is not as good as all the Christ movies I've seen. And I'm quite surprised that in this story Pilate wants to end Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as the other movies) are expressed differently. It also lacks a very important topic: the resurrection. None of the other films skips this important part: the faith of all Christians resides in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters: "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain." A very impressive scene for me in this movie was to see in the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish commentator, Jesus was NOT a myth. And in fact, it was also a JEW. There are a lot of documents (religious and lay) that show the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say, that God becomes a man) that in fact changed humanity. I highly recommend (since he is a historian) that he reads about Flavius ​​Josephus, the brightest Jewish commentator of the first. Century.
