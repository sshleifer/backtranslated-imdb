I would have liked to write about the story, but there was none. I would have liked to quote a couple of forceful dialogues from the movie, but "hinglish" is just fun for about 5 minutes, after that it's too much. I would have liked to faint with the 'suspense of guessing-u', but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a film by Yash raj (?). I would have liked to talk about the action of the edge of the seat, but I do not like cartoons very much. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is perfect for: 1. people who try to commit suicide: I promise that they will push you to the limit 2. Sado-masochists - this movie is much more effective than the barbed wire worn by the Silas boy in the Da-Vinci code. 3. People who investigate alternative ways of spreading terrorism. I swear the public that left the room seemed in the mood to kill someone. 4. Pirates of the movie: More power for them. If a movie deserves not to have the audience spending money to watch, here it is. 5.Boats, most types of plankton and green algae: because almost all other living things require a factor of IQ a little higher than that offered by the film. Later thinking: the director of the film, obviously, is a species of his own. (And I hope God is the only one of its kind ... one is enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Writer of scripts 4. A doubles coordinator 5. A story (Did I say that already?) 6. A director, preferably one who has no mental problems (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Plague bubonic: avoid it at all costs 8. A legal warning: "Watching movies of Yash Raj is detrimental to your mental health"? <br /> <br /> Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor: for obvious reasons 2 The English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes "My heart is in a vacuum", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "becomes" I'm a flirt, I'm a lover, I'm a vagabond "... without prices. <Br /> <br /> In short, Tashan for me, is like the opposite of a cube Rubens: the cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to reduce his IQ, and that ... in so only 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But that's just me. I could be wrong. You have been warned anyway.
