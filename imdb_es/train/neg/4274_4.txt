We are not in the fairytale of the naked emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confess, that this show is, in many aspects, simply incomprehensible and that it is clear, that a large part of it was created by pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <Well, obviously, a lot of people like those things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. And I also confess that the program is too serious for my taste and boring ... those love stories and drugs ... There are many exciting soaps with a lot of suspense (for example, Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I do not care about those people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
