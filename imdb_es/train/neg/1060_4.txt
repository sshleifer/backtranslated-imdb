OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it some credit for worrying about the terrorists and the idea that the CIA director make a plan to fly this doomed plane before that brings fatality. The world is prescient. That's. That is the good thing. The acting ... fair. The plot ... silly. The "turn" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody thinks what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Do not you think that bureaucrats have a manual for "pests" and how to contain them? The proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is transmitted through the air, why was the aircraft door open and the "shooters" standing there without protection? In fact, did it ever occur to someone to shoot his legs? That would stop her. But not so dramatic. . I'm an imbecile. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started. But it was a waste of time and, in general, predictable. I saw it using a tape recorder, so I did not have To see all the ads, that was an advantage. It is a good example of why I see so little television on the net.
