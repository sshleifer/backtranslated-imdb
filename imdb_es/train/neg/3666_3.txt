This is a very confusing movie. The movie is very difficult to follow and the plot does not seem to make any sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when a film is dubbed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was meant. Maybe this is part of the problem, but I doubt that I can explain all the problems with this movie. The dubbing is quite bad and the voices do not match very well with the characters. The scenes are choppy, there are a series of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this movie was the appearance of the werewolf himself and the scenes where he attacks. Now, if they could have put it all together and it would have made some sense, they might have had something. Do not waste your time on this.
