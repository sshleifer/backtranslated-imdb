"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies, I suppose, that is considered "art", but do not be fooled ... it's garbage. Follow the "art" that you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are often unintelligible fakes like this one. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest" as the camera explores. away from naked people. One of them a little boy urinating in a pool. Wow, this is something exciting and a true "art", is not it? That is just an example. Most of the story does not make sense, it is impossible to follow and, therefore, it is something that liberal critics fear to say that they did not "understand", so they give it high marks to save their false egos. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
