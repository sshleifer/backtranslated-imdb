There is enough star power in THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite debatable. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think maybe most would agree with them. (Good liberal democracy, violent fascist regime, bad open mentality, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are hit from head to toe with these, and so much subtlety is used as I have described them. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, we are seeing very noble people without any failures in square with unpleasant cretins that do not have redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated "pro" fight. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the boss, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted girlfriend and Glenn Close, as his sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the movie tends to move and is quite pleasant. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS is simply involved with too many subplots, and the characters appear and come out of the picture as they shoot at the gallery's objectives. We do not know them, therefore we do not care about them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (of the book of Isabel Allende) extended the film or cut some characters, this movie could have worked completely. As it is, it was a good attempt, with good messages, and a good yawning show. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
