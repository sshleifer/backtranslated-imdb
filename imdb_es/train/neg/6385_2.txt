Gayniggers from outer space is pretty well summarized by name. With only 27 minutes, it describes a spaceship of homosexual blacks coming to Earth to free men from women. While I see a bit of importance for the plot, it's also really illogical. Of course, it is meant to be a comedy / parody in society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so it succeeds there. <br /> <br /> The special effects are horrible. When the spacecraft is floating above the Earth, you can see the stars approaching for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at first seem false, the equipment in the ship is illogical, there are several spelling mistakes in the text, the actors are not convincing, the characters are in bad shape; In general, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you overcome all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it is very accessible and easy to see until the end. Some parts are hilarious. But in general, the only thing you have left to remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts of all. <br /> <br /> When seeing that it is a short film and has some fun aspects, it is not the worst that can be seen. . But it is illogical and has little long-term value. I really can not recommend it; If you see it, do it for the unique concept, not for the quality.
