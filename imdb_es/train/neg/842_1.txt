This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was almost not in that. This movie was just horrible. If you want to laugh and get bored, go and watch this movie. Words can not describe how stupid he is. I'm sorry michael. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknown. When looking at it, it feels like a soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This film had sexual connotations, since it is a clandestine assassin of S & M. The acting was bad, except the parts of Michael Madsen. It seemed he wanted to laugh. I hope you have paid well for this bad movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B movie on cable, it's more like an F and should never be shown.
