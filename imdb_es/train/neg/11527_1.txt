<br /> <br /> The movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie. It is about the child who is chosen, has no parents and is madly in love with the school # 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there's nothing you can not guess in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Maybe children around ten years old can enjoy the movie, but it is a bit violent for the little ones. You can not stop thinking about movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All those titles are better. I almost went out in the last 20 minutes! However, one thing that could have been good was the computer animation, BUT not even that is something to put on the Christmas tree. So my recommendation: do not watch this movie, even if you get paid for it.
