Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrifying. It's hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would have put money into this. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films that have already been destroyed at the box office, it is almost inconceivable that a study of any kind will be associated with this script. <br /> <br /> At first, it may seem like a sort of political derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But just 90 seconds into the movie, it becomes obvious that this is a no-talent attempt by DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk watching the DVD of this one. I must say that I do not know if Cusack is sensible enough so that he can see another characteristic starring him again, unless someone else can answer for it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is willing to commit suicide. Tom Cruise was never so close to being so far away. Not even close.
