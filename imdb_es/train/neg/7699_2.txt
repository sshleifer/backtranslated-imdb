I expected a comedy like the "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the film was a strange mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This film has three arguments: the first involves Madea and his take on a foster child. The second involves a woman who is committed to a rich man who abuses her. The third implies a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is very little comedy in the movie. There is also a series of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea hits the foster child with a belt (comically) to convince the child to straighten him out. The girl, in fact, turns around. Apparently, it's worth it to hit the children. <br /> <br /> There are plots related to child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men who eat with their eyes young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place in a family reunion). The movie jumps from one plot to another in such a way that you are always out of balance. Is this a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
