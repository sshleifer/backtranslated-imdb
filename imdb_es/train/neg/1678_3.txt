I'm looking forward to a "Holmes con Puertas" word game but I can not put it all together. Conveniently dirty and over edited, WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time ... but how timid is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films show it all the time and they skip the graphic violence ... as one famous person once said about the double standard of American cinema: "kissing a chest and it's an X, stabbing it and it's an action PG 13 ". WONDERLAND also lasts 14 minutes, and in the end, the tenacious spiral we were all happy to escape from the cinema. How many movies called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and the dull color set the sordid tone, but the wobble-cam becomes boring, as if we were stuck in the nose all the time. Taking some indications from THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, everything becomes forgettable the next day.
