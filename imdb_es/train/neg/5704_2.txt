After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time to go see it. Well, I do not know why I bothered. Basically, this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a great hiding place of ancient treasures, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently, it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the Knights say they moved the treasure of Europe to America? How did Nic Cages' character discover that 'Charlotte' was actually a ship? How do they discover all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best kept paper in the world? These are just some of the holes in the plot in this crazy bit of Hollywood action that went wrong. Cage has been in some of the best action movies, 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock', so why has he stooped to this? Are you getting too old? Your character is quite annoying actually. Somehow, this 'ordinary' guy steals the Declaration of Independence, overcomes robbers with weapons, escapes from the FBI and, in general, seems invincible. The whole movie really does not make any sense and, in general, it was quite a disappointment.
