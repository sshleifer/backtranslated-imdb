Somewhere inside this movie there is a half hour episode of The Twilight Zone that tries to leave. While Cube was tense, well-done, claustrophobic and mentally attractive, I'm afraid that Cypher is a boring and tedious rehash of several worn-out themes that just do not add up much, especially if you've seen almost any other half of the decent science fiction movie before. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to drag all the way through his relatively short 95 minutes to the incompetent end. None of the characters unleash each other, and for a film made in 2002, the technology is really cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired film with the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good one. <br /> <br /> When you saw the grass grow and paint dry and you get bored with your insects, then, of course, watch this movie. but the other activities will probably be more stimulating.
