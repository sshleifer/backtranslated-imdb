Words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I saw it on video last night, and I just could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about a former soldier (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Rednecks in the style of Deliverance. The acting, writing, directing, photography and editing of the film are deplorable along with a song called "Soldier" which has to be one of the worst songs of all time! <br /> <br /> However, there is a gift. . "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) of "Welcome Back Carter" is in the film playing a bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at all costs.
