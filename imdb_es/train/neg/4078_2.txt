JESSICA: A HISTORY OF GHOST is like its name implies a ghost story. The subject pretends to be horror, but it is closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman comes who was brutally murdered and returns from the dead. This constitutes what this film tries to pass as an argument. There really is nothing more than that. The film is composed of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before his death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the initial scenes, this movie has the appearance of a "direct to -DVD" effort. Unlike gems like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives a bad name to "direct to DVD" movies. The direction is as poor as it can be with a complete lack of suspense, fear or tension. Even the dramatic elements are irremediably handled and represent something more boring than even the worst telenovela that you could have had the misfortune to endure. <br /> <br /> The action in all areas is absolutely abysmal and no actor involved manages to do so. show even the lowest potential of a successful career as an actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 instead of 1 is because some of the acting poorly combined with an even worse dialogue for some unintentional laughs. I emphasize the word "few" in that phrase. This is not, in general, one of the films "so bad, it's good", like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a horror movie about ghosts, see THE LEGEND OF HELL, THE CHANGE, THE RINGU, THE EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDE, A PERFECT CALL OR THE PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who has been lucky enough to avoid seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY to continue the good work! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not worry about that!
