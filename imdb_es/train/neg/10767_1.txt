Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but also the worst, without seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and it shows. We are all made to be a group of overly sexed fans and imbeciles. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we financed this litter. Of course the British character is normal. The rest is a stereotype of situation comedy, can you say "Norma !!"? The cinematography ranges from beautiful images of postcards to dark silhouettes of interiors. The actors always seem to be restless. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the idea of ​​film directors? Avoid this mess and check out some of the Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You will not be forced to leave your movies after 10 minutes.
