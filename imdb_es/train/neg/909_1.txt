Never ever consider seeing this sorry excuse for a movie. the way it shoots, illuminates, acts, etc. It just does not make sense. Everything is so bad that it is difficult to see. A lot of clips are repeated beyond boredom. It seems that there is no 'normal' person in the whole movie and the existence of the 'outside world' is, well, it just does not exist. And why does that bald guy suddenly become invincible? This movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
