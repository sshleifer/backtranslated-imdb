The enthusiasm for this movie has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set and, finally, all the visible elements of this movie.

Suffice to say that these characters are so stupid that they do not think about disconnecting a machine instead of ...
