Oh, where to start ... this movie was horrible. The writing was bad, the acting was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but I certainly did not understand that! I thought it would be decent enough since I'm not demanding. I've seen several horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, no matter how terrible they may be. At one point in the movie I made a comment about the "corn syrup blood" and in the special features, they really admit that it was the Karo syrup (brand of corn syrup ...) The film had all the necessary things to a terror movie. (Blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves) but something was missing completely to make it really good. The writer must take some classes or just give up!
