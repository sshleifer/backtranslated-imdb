The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in real life at the IMDb makes me realize that his junket staff is working hard to make people see this film absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> I have no words, I have no idea where to begin to describe the truly horrible movie I was sitting on last night: Dan in Real Life. The characters of Steve in previous films made me believe that I would feel something for him and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so artificial, the family was the cookie cutter of the Walton family and the movie has been so many times before I was surprised that someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and accept a pass in this terribly bad movie and do not believe everything you read in the IMDb since the first comments were written clearly by people sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD movie .
