Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most, is that the program was filmed in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have filmed it in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more faithful to the movie. The first scene in which they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with many pinetrees where it seems cold. That does not feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels as if they were running fighting against aliens in a Canadian forest. And it is so unpleasant that apparently, on other planets, the fall also occurs. You can see the leaves on the ground in the forrests that look like the forrests outside of Vancouver. It just makes the show even more incredible and silly. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russel. Sure, he does a decent job and tries to copy Russels' performance a bit, but he's not as good as Russel. And not as good actor as Russel. And Russell's way of playing O Neill, well, was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, it's too soft. I liked the fact that Russels' version just did not give him a shit and he had no trouble detonating the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a very good job as Jackson, although he replaces James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. He is not a Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks and acts like a robot. I have seen a better performance by Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and Ra's character and the people who saved in the movie can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly silly. What made the aliens so terrifying in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects in the real show are badly made and they look cheap. Especially a planet that they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they walk around a sound studio with a paint made wrong in the background. It is an insult to us the spectators who have made it so cheap. Especially when they could have done it in front of a blue screen with CGI funds. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before the SG-1 began. And they did not have the apparent budget of two million dollars per episode, which supposedly had the SG-1. They must have spent all the money on catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and useless show, it could have been great if they had filmed the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
