The 'Tashan' of Vijay Krishna Acharya is an exaggerated and stylized product. Surely it is one of the most elegant films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The movie script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. The script is the king, without a good script, even the best director of all time can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars that appear on it. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is tasteless. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could I accept a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact, he is the only salvation. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks awesome and leaves you, all standing. Saif Ali Khan does not have his deserved here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The failure of movies at the box office, if you stay away.
