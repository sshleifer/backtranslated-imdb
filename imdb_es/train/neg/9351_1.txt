This is only the second time I stopped a video / DVD halfway. <br /> <br /> At first, I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt, although it managed to be superficial, clich√© and stupid .. And without joy, annoying and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like a special after school program run by that strange ninth grader who thinks no one understands ... creepy and sad, with a narration that only the most cheated teenager I would consider poetry ... and some singing, and ... no, actually, the poor child suffering ... <br /> <br /> It was enough, especially when it turned into a cheeky, clumsy, and insulting the mechanical orange bell. And did I mention the song? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've seen, but it's certainly the one I least feel compelled to listen to. I do not recommend to anybody.
