Last night I decided to watch the prequel or I must say the prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" that went directly to DVD ... it does not surprise me ... completely ... and I mean completely to S % & KS !!! The last time I see it, I think it would be a waste of time writing about it ... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to the production of this sh # t-fest of a movie ... except just one fact I take off my hat ... Jay Hernandez, who plays the young Brigante ... reminded me how De Niro put himself in Brando's shoes to play the young Don Corleone in the Godfather II ... but the difference of Niro was incredible and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez, well, he has guts to try to be a young Pacino ... too bad for him, I do not think he's going to continue playing in the movie and, by the way, after watching this $ #% movie, I sat down and I watched Charlie's original way of removing the bad taste from my mouth.
