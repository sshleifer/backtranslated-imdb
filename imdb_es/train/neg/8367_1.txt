This piece of shit, since I can not call it a movie, can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> - A stereotypical black criminal with a black dwarf companion who gets into trouble - Black Midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitals. The black dwarf is confused (in some way) with the man and woman who want to have a baby. The black dwarf who commits acts of physical and sexual violence, defames white people wherever he sees. they, and they commit more crimes -Friend ending <br /> <br /> Honestly, it could have been a good satire if it had not been run so superficially and had bastard bastards without talent.
