This is not one of those reviews about the deficient special effects or technology, or the date, problems that only the dumbest people could relate to, but a review about storytelling, in which most of us are really interested <Br /> <br /> The plot is about a combination of allied World War II members and the German Navy, and two civilians (the hero and the heroine), who are together in a German U boat and end up in a wild land of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The manipulations are not so bad for film standards, and we know from the plot that realism is not going to be high. What films like this need are credible and nice characters, along with a little bit of reason in the actions. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks both. For a long film, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are barely studied. McClure's hero is beyond "routine," and does not make much sense in any era. <br /> <br /> The female seems to be looking for an answer to an enigma about the land of the dinosaurs that they entered, but the enigma. It is not an enigma, and we could care less. <br /> <br /> A lot of failure in a movie that should have been better, even at the time.
