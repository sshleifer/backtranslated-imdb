Certainly, NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, sword games and a cinematography of delicious landscapes that you will probably see, but this is not what makes a movie good. Help, but history has to shine through these things. And that's where Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is being forced, giving it the feeling that it was thrown together simply to make a "great" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story unfolds (and it is obviously obvious with names like Lee and Hern√°ndez). If the filmmakers want to involve us in a culture like the Play and the Kazaks, they will better use the actors / actresses who seem to be part of them. <br /> <br /> Tribes in conflict, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, an interest in the love that separates our "heroes", all are touched, but with so little impact and screen time that most The spectators will be set apart in favor of the next battle sequence, the next scene of the action horse or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during his filming, specifically the director and the director of photography. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (director of photography) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have a better view since his visions of the lands made the final cut we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the change to Bodrov as director may not have been the smartest option. From what I'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not on the people, which I feel come from the eyes of Bodrov and not Passer. A real farce. <br /> <br /> The most embarrassing aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic movie, with a focus on both characters and action. Unfortunately, the members of the hierarchy apparently decided that the action was what was needed and took the cheap exit (intellectually speaking). <br /> <br /> Although I can not give a positive rating to this movie, it's worth seeing. Simply because of the incredible cinematographic work. But that's it.
