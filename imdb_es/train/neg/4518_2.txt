Few films have frustrated expectations and disgusted me as much as Fire. The movie is pretentious trash. It does not achieve anything at the artistic level. The only thing he managed to receive is a ban in India. If only for the poor quality of filmmaking instead of the current controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable. <br /> <br /> Now that I have eliminated my problem from my system, I am better able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the movie seems unreal, especially when the protagonists begin to converse in English The director, of course, did not make the film for an Indian audience; however, he underestimated his international audiences by oversimplifying them. Seeing the character of domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Below, we regularly glimpse Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They rise as discordant and obstruct the flow of the film. I still wonder how that philosophical dialogue connected with history. I felt that surrealism had been lost. <br /> <br /> * The love scenes seemed voyeuristic and are probably intended to audition the audience instead of being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve either. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and, therefore, have been selected to surprise the public. However, as the film was not intended for the Indian public in the first place, the selection of concussion through the name does not pretend to achieve its objective, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the address It is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been mismanaged. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama from the subject. <br /> <br /> * The performance felt hard, although Nandita Das contributed some life to the paper, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not evident in this movie. The male drivers were simply trash. <br /> <br /> In case you are a fan of the Earth and want to see the director more, get away from it. Please.
