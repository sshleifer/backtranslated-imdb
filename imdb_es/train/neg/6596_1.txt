This is the kind of film that is seen in a horrified silence, open-mouthed, and that keeps looking, hypnotized, as if it were a train in slow motion. And yet, in the back of his mind, the thoughts are shaken: "Who in EARTH illuminated this garbage green?" <br /> <br /> Some of the comments from previous users say things like: "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to children everywhere. That children need some kind of training plan to learn how to love slapstick comedy shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others have commented on the fidelity of the characterizations of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy to which he would respond: WHAT, then? One might think that the series of BOMBS from movies based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply can not be recreated. Laurel and Hardy's films are available on video: why bother with this? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, an excellent theater and screen actor ... well, all I can say is, he must have been in trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, away from the television if this crap gets going!
