Well, I would be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still, it was more attractive to me because of its moral value. The first time I bought the VHS was when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and we have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie, "Hollywood Shuffle." It is true that you need to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make movies more credible, but your movies are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero with a contemporary urban touch. I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they would not provide the same scenarios that are shown in the comics. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: a meddling car, a bad neighborhood, local gangs of drug dealers who use children for distribution, etc. The scope of its mission remained practically within the community. <br /> <br /> It was found to be truly entertaining, apart from the performance of James Earl Jones in "the young forever," the way the neighborhood responded to their newly discovered powers. It was not long before they had a complete agenda for him, without his input, of course. It was funny to hear them offer to lend it to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the film was predictable, there was bad performance and continuity was bad, but it ranks number 1 with my children. Robert Townsend works to bring the movies "home", so to speak. I doubt that he will ever be recognized as the talented actor / producer / director that he really is, but there are and always will be those who love him for his effort. <br /> <br /> A point to reflect on The movie, which I find amusing: Throughout the whole battle with Simon, nobody bothered to call the police? Also, what mother and father know that they will see their child fight from a window? My mother would have been there, scrapped by my side, face to face. Dad would be carrying his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and take a look. It's worth seeing at least once and it's good for those of you who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great work with cameos Robert!
