This is the least terrifying movie I've seen in my life. How the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the movie. The blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape from it. The spot is very lucky to find a typical horror movie that, instead of fleeing, stays quiet for half an hour to eat it. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend you do it, it's too fun to be taken seriously.
