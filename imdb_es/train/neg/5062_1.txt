This movie is strange. Better said, it's "fucking weird". I could give you a summary of the plot, or some analysis of the city, but I consider it a waste of time. All that everyone should know about this film are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, homicide, post-mortem mutilation and a really disturbing infatuation. At the end of the film you feel like you should go take a shower to wash away the dirt, but not in a good way like after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's as if you were a teenager (or a high school student that I am myself) and I just did something that A: you wish you had not done, and B: wait for the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never know And to nobody likes that. My advice is that, instead of messing up your mind and seeing a piece of cinematic filth, simply waste your time on something a little less horrible and look at "Kazaam" (yes, I would prefer to see "Kazaam" than "Assassins maids", read what you want in it).
