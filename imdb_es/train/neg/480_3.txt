2 stars for Kay Francis - she is wonderful! And he did not deserve this horrible gut that Warner Bros. shot him! <br /> <br /> The double premise on which this film is based is ridiculous and extremely incredible. Kay is a wife and mother of a small town that yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a major actor arrives in the city and invites Kay to her hotel to discuss the possibilities, Kay tells her husband that she is going to the movies. The bidder of a husband's mother puts a mistake in the husband's ear that Kay is not being sincere, and he starts looking for her. He finds her with the actor in the hotel (they're just talking!) And shoots the man, who falls down a railing, lands face to face in a pond (lake?) And dies. Now here are the two incredible premises on which the rest of the film is based: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the man died * before * his head sank into water, they must find the husband guilty of murder in the first degree. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think that killing a man in an attack of anger would count as murder or murder 2 at the most, not the FIRST DEGREE of murder.Give me a break! But the conspiracy required that he be found guilty of murder 1 so he can be sent to prison for life, whatever.) <br /> <br /> 2) the husband's lawyer, after the conviction and sentence, tells Kay that everything is HIS guilt. Her reasoning is that if she had not gone to the actor's room, then her husband would not have had to go after her, hit the guy and kill him. He tells her that she is the culprit, not her husband, and she agrees and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is about Kay trying to achieve fame and money to free her husband from prison and correct the mistake he made by having him kill the actor as an actor in the first place. <br /> <br /> I can not continue with this revision. The movie was too painful. Four years before, in the days before the code, you would never have seen Kay playing a puppet! However, in the style of Kay Francis, he did everything possible to make us believe that this woman was a credible character. I give him a lot of credit for trying to breathe a little life and credibility to this ungrateful role. This character was very far from the roles of Kay pre-code and the fire of real life Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Get away from this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can strongly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, Dr. Monica and One Way Passage are also good, I'm sure there are other excellent Kay movies too, but I just mention the ones I mention) seen and I can recommend.)
