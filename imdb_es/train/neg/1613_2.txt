Now that Che (2008) has finished his relatively short Australian film career (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can join the two presenters of "At The Movies" without fail in Steven's assignment Soderbergh <Br /> <br /> It is usually satisfying to see a film director change his style / theme, but the most recent stinker from Soderbergh, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story, so the narrative (and the edition?) seems to be suddenly Soderbergh's main challenge. Strange, after 20 years in the business. Probably he was never very good in the narrative, he simply hid it well within the "avant-garde" projects. <br /> <br /> None of this excuses this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not form a whole." <br /> <br /> Biopic epic in name only, Che (2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! Certainly it has no legs, insofar as, with the exception of its unusual final resolution imposed by history, Soderbergh's 4.5-hour remorse reaches nowhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, more indulgent with the films of Australia At The Movies. duo, noticed about the repetitive loss of Soderbergh (high definition digital storage): "you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ...". I am also surprised that Soderbergh has not given us another 2.5 hours of ESO somewhere between his two existing parts, because he was still left out of the massive chunks of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For a biography of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh inexplicably alienates, if not deliberately insulting, his audiences by <br /> <br /> 1. never providing most of the story of Che; <br /> <br /> 2. impose unreasonable film lengths with mere repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. ignoring both the true retrospective and a narration of the events; <br /> <br /> 4. just developing an idea, or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. being claustrophobically episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignore the appropriate context for the scenes, whatever we get is stuck in times of disturbing turns; <br /> <br /> 7. Linguistically dislocate all audiences (even Spanish-speakers will be confused with incongruous exposures in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. Uselessly cover up your main theme in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their script solely on Guevara's memoirs. Then, as a poor student who has read only ONE of his assigned texts for assignment, the Soderbergh product has an extremely limited perspective. <br /> <br /> The public is captive within the same knowledge, setting and limited circumstances of the "revolutionaries", but that does not arouse our sympathy. Instead, we realize that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to hinder his audience like the Latino peasants at that time." But these are the same illiterate Latino peasants who sold the good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us mentally captive as well? Such a take-up of the audience must have a purpose. <br /> <br /> Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally numb with its repeated attacks on shrubs, the misery of perspective and the lack of arcs of variety or character. DelToro's Che has no chance to grow as a person as he struggles to educate his own ill-disciplined troops. The only disappointment is humor when Che deals with his sometimes-profoundly ignorant "revolutionaries," some of whom violently lack self-control around local peasants or food. Certainly, we do not have an idea of ​​what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of his guerrilla insurgency, as it was. <br /> <br /> Part2's countdown continues to be fearfully episodic: once again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus, even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demián Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. Any selected event is presented in a minimal way and focused on Latinos, with the interviews of Part 1 replaced by temporary meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and the officials of the Government of the United States who promise the intervention of the INC (!). <br /> <br /> the rest of the "forests" of Part 2 and the blue filter of the day at night simply exasperate the audience until they are watching the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro felt the frustration of many non-US Latinos for never coming up with a true and implacable story of Che's exploits in their own countries. When foreign governments do not yet deliver a free press to their people, for whatever reason, then one can see how a popular American indie producer might try to attract the not-so-well-read ("It may not be so.") read or write, but I am NOT illiterate! "- The Inspector General (1949) to his own local cinemas The obvious negligences of the film and the oversimplifications hint very strongly that it points only to the understanding of those who are least If they did, they would already have read comments on the subject and criticized the relevant social problems among them, learning the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> Those ideas are precisely what societies still need - -and not only to the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South America-, however, is what Che (2008) blithely does not fulfill: Soderbergh buries his clue because he is weak in the narrative. Stunned why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. 44 years have passed, the retrospective on Guevara was very desired: for that I went to see this movie, but the director steals us diabolically that. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) noted that while Part 1 was "uneven", Part 2 actually "goes rapidly downhill" from there, "tracing the final campaign of Che in Bolivia in an unbearable detail ", that" ... feels almost unbearably slow and turgid ". <br /> <br /> Che: The Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly not a travel notebook for Bolivia, painting a picture of misery and atavism. The entire second half can only be redeemed by the aforementioned humor, and by the dramatic, though tragic, capture and execution of the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this endless cinema is simply a confusion, an irritating misery. - Surprisingly, for a Soderbergh movie, it should be avoided at all costs. He is bound to break the hearts of all who know, even a little about the subject. (2/10)
