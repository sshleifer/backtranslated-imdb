It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is amazing in how atrocious it is. Turning off the DVD player was not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and give them a slap in the face. I will never recover that time again. Never. How is it possible to create a movie so banal, boring and soulless? I could not think of a course of action that would alleviate boredom. Writing the ten required lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful piece of film. What more can you say than reiterate how truly horrible is the performance? Please avoid
