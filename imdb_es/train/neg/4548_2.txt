Boring. Minimum plot There is no development of the character. I entered this film with high expectations of the book. It COULD have been an awesome movie. It COULD have become a cult classic. No, it was a giant disappointment. It was badly melted and had horrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels, the military, the church or all of them. I'm still baffled by certain mini-plots of the movie. I am stunned as to certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never fully explained. I felt like I was watching a cheesy episode of a miniseries on the science fiction channel. It seemed like a movie made for television. Do not go to see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
