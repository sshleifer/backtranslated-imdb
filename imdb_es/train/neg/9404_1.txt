This absolute rubbish is based so closely on the series on Friday the 13th, which is practically a carbon copy, and is accepted as an Australian film with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> There was once a child. He accidentally burned during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, several years later, the boy has already grown and is taking revenge on anyone who comes to the lake to film a music video. It is loaded with clich√©s and it is a waste of time and money, to see it just out of curiosity or if you are an aspiring actor who tries to learn how NOT (not to be able to) act. The main role that Alan Dale used to star in the soap opera Neighbors, but ended up in The X Files, how did THAT happen?
