It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone gave viewers a cross-legged ride that twisted the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, she's in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the successful erotic "Basic Instinct" with a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, it is possible that fans of the original do not even come close to it, because "Instinct 2" is a painful film, since the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones murders the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film begins when a car explosion breaks right at the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy) is suspicious and seems to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is appointed to examine her, but eventually falls in love with an intimate game of seduction. <br /> <br /> And there it is, without further explanation, the basic force that moves this "Instinct." It does not explain much and we have to sit through a bad quality C-class erotic movie. Sharon Stone stars in her first role, where most of the time it's a detour. Part of it due to amateur writing, sloppy direction and frighteningly low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a scene from menage to trois was cut so that it would not qualify as NC-17) than the first entry in the series. "Instinct" is a convincing torture. <br /> <br /> To top it off, everything that made the original movie a guilty pleasure is nowhere to be found in the film. The performance here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here, she becomes extremely odious. David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life, and it seems that he never makes more than two expressions in the film: confused and excited. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series, which managed to put the thriller with eroticism extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you ... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and, in fact, it is not. Some films should never leave the paper, and that is the feeling you have after seeing this. Now, it's much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg left, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a big paycheck for this ....... 3/10
