STAR QUALIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson ( Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconnaissance mission along with three new young recruits from the attacking team after disobeying a direct order from above. However, the night before the strike, they are all killed by a murderer with a seemingly inhuman force. With the French police wandering about with their own investigation, he himself looks for those responsible, only to discover a corrupt army faction that deals with a new deadly drug that alters a person's DNA and gives it a new and terrifying force. <Br /> <br /> Bad cover. Bad title Bad manipulation of post-production. And bad trailer. Very bad movie. But, I have to say, I do not think Attack Force is all the worse. I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other critics here (maybe not Steveday!) But I think a lot of the criticism comes from all the bad news that happened before the movie instead of the actual quality of it. <br /> <br /> I must say that there was not as much dubbing or cable editing as I had made it believe. The dubbing that took place (which made it sound like Martin Sheen with a problem in the groin) was pretty horrible and quite frequent, but it was not used for such a large segment of the movie as he thought. The plot flowed pretty well too, considering all the problems with the original finished movie called Harvester that continued. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the film has a nice Gothic look, a new twist for a Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute high point was the total and total lack of any exciting action. However, with only a few bad fight scenes filmed for any fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, I'd rather see this again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill. **
