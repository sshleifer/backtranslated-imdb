I expected a lot from this movie. Something like Lee as a character like Naustradamous, but all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. It had wooden performances, terrible scripts of Bible pieces like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was the end! The rest I had to wait and wait for something significant to happen, but it was not like that. This film is about a couple trying to discover the changes that are happening in the world, like places in China where there was an earthquake and ending in a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent ends up being the key to mistakes. The whole movie is deceiving and boring. One of the worst worst.
