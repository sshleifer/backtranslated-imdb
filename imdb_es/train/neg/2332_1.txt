What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and directors a great payday for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring movie. An ex-head pugilist falls in love with a rare woman and her relatives. He begins as a man of reparation for the woman, and ends up hitting a man and being trapped in a plan of kidnapping. It was so confusing that I can not even write a decent review. If you see this, my sweet, make sure it's at night so you can go to sleep.
