I do not know where to start, so I'll start with a fragment from the back of the cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's cube with Kitamura's own Versus." I have not seen Versus, so I can not comment on that, but I think Cube was an excellent movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone has clearly confused "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I'm going to go ahead and ruin the whole plot, because besides being a sacred Swiss cheese of a plot, it's also moldy cheese, and the movie is not worth spending time on, even if you do not know the plot in advance, so it does not matter. If I misunderstood the plan, do not hit me, probably because I had to work hard to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the US military in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. Apparently this makes sense because both are deserts, so they are probably practically the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired something strange that was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. Whatever is. The alien thing is now transmitted to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to move it from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another type. But instead of just getting someone out of the army, which is full of bloodthirsty people, and they're already on the military side, they decide it's probably a good idea to get a criminal out of the death row. Oh, and the reason why they choose this particular death row criminal is because he was the first person in history not to die from the non-lethal electric shock, which is the standard method of execution, because everyone dies the placebo effect when electrocuted. I do not know if they do this to be able to laugh in the staff room because of the way they all die, even if it's not deadly, or if they just want to reduce the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the film becomes what The Matrix would have been if it had been really scarce, and the superfluous fight bores us to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh, wait, now remember they already had a guy infected with the alien thing, so the whole movie up to this point was actually a total waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only time in the movie that I did not want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich instead, was when a guy was trapped on a wall by a pipe through his chest. , and he is circling up there and another guy is passing by. The guy hanging on the wall says: "It hurts, shoot me." And the live guy looks at him, and it's not like he's a bad guy or something, so he really looks sad and does not want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical pause). <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Gee THANKS TO FREAKIN 'HEAP."
