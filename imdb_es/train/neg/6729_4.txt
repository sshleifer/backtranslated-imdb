Obviously, many people like this, but I found the codownall childish and reasonably offensive, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there is a marked drop in the invention later). I do not get along with Monroe, she's supposed to be a silly blonde who is not that stupid, but she gets so stupid. Russell can not fully convince when he states that he has never been to a gym, but it is quite wonderful. Men are surprisingly uninteresting, as is the plot. In no way is it atrocious, but so irregular that, if this is a classic, God help us all.
