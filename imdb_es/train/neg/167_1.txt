Anyone who has been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the story, should feel embarrassed by this series. The Borg do not return until Q takes the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk finds them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to bear the name of the Enterprise ... do I need to continue? Berman and Pilliar have mocked the creation of Gene Roddenberry. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just followed their own path. No wonder Majel Barrett has been in every episode of Star Trek until this series. I do not blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor, as is the entire cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the precedents established by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people saw Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
