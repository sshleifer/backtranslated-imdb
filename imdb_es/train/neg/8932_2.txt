I must say that I was very curious to see this movie, and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It also appeared on several lists of bad movie critics, and this only deepened the interest, as Solo had to see why this movie was so bad. To see it, I think I have my answers. Although I will say that it makes it funny, the acting, the direction and the script are so smiling that the supposed satire is completely absent. Racquel Welch seems to try to take the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation, the film goes so far that she can not handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is not any help, since he licks and reads the screen, sometimes it seems he wonders what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces like Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own famous masturbation scene. Bravo for the debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a silly blonde; She certainly seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, possibly the most notorious role went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual advances seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not mean to discard this personally; But in this movie, nobody gets it right. The direction seems so insecure and nonexistent, that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Add some old movie images from old stars and the film gets disconnected even more. For everyone, for anyone who has enjoyed this, and I was glad to have seen it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that always had the reputation of being from the beginning.
