Alicia Silverstone (before "Clueless") plays a modern teenager obsessed with crime who tries to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which is not especially well done but which, however, is surprisingly serious in terms of its main character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in forming an interesting young girl here, even though the movie is undermining. The cast of cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last act is exaggerated. It's not a cheesy country festival, but nothing exceptionally memorable. * 1/2 of ****
