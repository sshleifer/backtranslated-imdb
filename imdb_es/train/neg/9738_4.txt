It's not so bad, as it is attributed to being (Hooper is much worse)? More disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, which is never used by Hooper with his economic direction and much less in the smoky writing (excuse of the play on words). It becomes so sinister and exaggerated in a very serious tone, it becomes ridiculous and out of focus, allowing all the pessimistic / narrative mystery impregnated with conspiracy to be easily telegraphed to end up in something completely abrupt. Because of that, the pace is still quite slow and Brad Dourif (great to see him in a leading role) seems to have problems with an unbalanced performance, although it shows a strangely extravagant intensity for his colorless character. Although it is done cheaply, there is a competent technical attitude to it. However, it does not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to get rid of unpleasant shocks (some work) and, on the other hand, steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper shows some frantic images with style (even more towards the last extreme), and the work of the camera is maneuvered quickly and the emission score is exciting. The performances are little in the whole store with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but funny cameos. especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but it is passively attractive.
