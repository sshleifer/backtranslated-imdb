This movie made me feel like I had missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I felt very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, besides that I have always trusted and respected the taste of Danny Glovers in his choice of roles, "Grand Canyon", for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably a little over an hour; We had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters that made you empathize or sympathize with them, it did not evoke any emotion in relation to this film and the clips from its past were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love seeing the whites scared and start acting like complete idiots, makes me laugh) became a loss of my $ 1 credit in the video store.
