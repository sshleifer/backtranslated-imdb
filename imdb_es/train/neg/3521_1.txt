I still shudder to think of NEVER going back to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen action movies, I have even liked some of them, but this goes further. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have the worst male actor (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the start (why not steal the money while the plane is on the ground , I would). be much easier) that it is required that a person with IQ less than his number does not believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real twists at all, a three-year-old could guess what will come next. It's a set of clich√©s (of the action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other films (it was even better in Rambo III if you see that movie as a comedy instead of an action movie). Now there is an actor who can not act A) surprised B) sad C) nothing but his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that could make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are exceptional, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. The LANDSCAPES are magnificent, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better views that way, instead of wasting time in this movie. <br /> <br /> Go see another movie in its place, There are hundreds, even thousands of best action movies.
