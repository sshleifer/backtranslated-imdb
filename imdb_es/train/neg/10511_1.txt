Note to fans of horror: the only horror here is when you realized that you lost 95 minutes of your life in a movie that has no value, is insulting. <br /> <br /> I saw it because: <br /> <br /> The premise sounded a bit promising: it is not. It's just an excuse to use the same pieces of other low-budget movies that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded good even if the movie turned out to be horrible: it is not. It is not. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are as sensual as the average homeless person. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: he is the king of low-budget special effects. and low budget performance. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to see this movie. It's not that it's bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and since then he has been working on horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a fact after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless rhythm; the way the director treats the "plot" and the "characterization" as an annoyance that he believes no one cares about anyway; and the terribly long and boring sequences of driving, walking and nature (undoubtedly added to increase the execution time for the film to be suitable for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and narration in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number one way you can know if a movie is going to be bad: if it is written and directed by the same person, it expects garbage.
