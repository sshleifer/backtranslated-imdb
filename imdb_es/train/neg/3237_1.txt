It is not that I am bored with joy when I see a realistic bloodshed, but when I place a DVD waiting for a bloodbath, what I get is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the end of the tail of a fake and loud clap. . a desk chair, I end up thinking "well, that's 43 minutes of my life that are gone forever". I would not consider this or "movies" of Flower of Flesh and Blood as an exercise of will; To see if you can sit through them. Flower of flesh and bone had some difficult points to see. The Devil Experiment did not do it. It was at best, stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectations were too high. I put the DVD thinking "oh man, this is going to be sick". After seeing them as a fake slap to the girl about a thousand times, I was seeing him in a fast forward. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People looking for F'd movies just to see how high they are from F'd, or 2) the most complete horror. I looked for this and the other guinea pig movies for the latter reason, but even if I fall into the category of the previous one, this movie would not make my boat float. In fact, I could imagine that this movie would increase one's blood thirst ... as in "YOU WOULD ONLY KILL B * TCH NOW !!" So, in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collection purposes. If you want a butcher shop that traditional horror does not provide, get traces of death. Of course, that also sucks, but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see if someone praises this shit is because they feel they should do it. No artistic merit you can understand, no reason for your notoriety, nothing. Just an unconvincing attempt to be shocking.
