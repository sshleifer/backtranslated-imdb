What The Bleep Do We Know is a deceptive and casual look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who ramble and pontificate in a completely unscientific way. Their interviews are divided into aggravatingly small segments and scattered along some banal and flashy magical miniatures. <br /> <br /> The film addresses issues of science, philosophy, theology and politics, uniting them regardless of accuracy. , and then somehow extracts some prosaic and absurd conclusions. They lead us to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult question to answer that the filmmakers would like to point out. <br /> <br /> It's a series of errors and logic. non-sequiturs How do we start with quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two is four, therefore I can move objects with my mind". <br /> <br /> There is nothing original in this movie, and almost nothing is accurate. Any viewer who discriminates will be annoyed with hard-hand editing, intrusive and nonsensical special effects, and general lack of substance. Educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence inflicted on science and all the other issues addressed by this film.
