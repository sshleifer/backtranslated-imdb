'Metamoprhis' is the story of a handsome young scientist, venerated at the local university, who is investigated by the financial providers of the university. This forces him to take shortcuts in the typical Hollywood melodramatic way. <br /> <br /> My first thought after the conclusion of this movie was this. "It's not good, but it's not bad, from the beginning until the mid-eighties." Of course, then I realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it to a '4', but decided to keep it in the mediocre '5' that it is. <br /> <br /> 'Metamorphis' On some occasions, it seems like a good movie trying desperately to get out. The performance, although not stellar, is above all competent. You can even see the occasional brightness of a modest quality. Stimulation is a big problem with the movie. After thinking that I had been watching for ninety minutes, I realized that I had only been observing one hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be competent enough to solve that weakness. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying a combined channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher. Reeves, he reminded me most of all of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does a good job, but is not distinguished in any way. Here is a role of 'naughty girl', and the actress does what she can with that, but it does not seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can not decide if he is grumpy, happy or just plain weird. <br /> <br /> The rhythm, as I said, is the worst problem of this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush. It is strange and inexplicable, until the final scene, which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with all the bad tricks of the camera and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> One decent time only Look at the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that will bring you back, and nothing to buy for yourself.
