This is the first of these "8 Films To Die For" collections that I've seen, and I certainly have not wanted to see anything of the rest ... although I've heard that at least a couple of them are decent. I do not know, this was not terrible but it really did not do much for me. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in the suburban type of things, mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they continued to bring home fountains of lost food wherever possible. The best part of this was the spooky Gothic sister, who of course invites a friend from school who never leaves. Anyway, of course, we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on. This family is something like the white bread version of the Clan Sawyer, they are unpleasant and do bad things, but they have no soul. I see many comments from people who have liked this, and I think I do not know what I missed, but I found it very mediocre and I would not really recommend it to anyone. 4 out of 10
