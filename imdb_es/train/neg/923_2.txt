For some reason, several young couples who walk through the Italian Alps split up to see who can first get to the designation of their camp. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds the skeleton of a demonic ancient gladiator and is possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet that belongs to the corpse. Then he spends the rest of the film running through the woods chasing his friends and cutting his limbs to add some stew to make the undead "Demonicus" come back to life. This release of Full Moon in digital format is stupid, meaningless, has a terrible performance and sound and the Los Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it is quite high on the scale of unintentional laughter, mainly due to the excessive performance of lead. You have to see to believe, whether with insect eyes running in a cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or letting out a neurotic Latin uproar over demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and the clumsy delivery of lines. Oh, well, at least it's not boring like most of the rest of the cast.
