Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this movie <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles, since his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later also has costumes <br /> <br /> In short, he is a useless detective who sends a case to his friend to obtain evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani. <br /> <br /> He disguises himself as a Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl. How funny is how easy and in a short time it does? <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters a TV to get lol tests and then as a Maharashtrian (yes inside the TV) <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same wrong identities and ends in a predictable note. There are some funny scenes like Govinda being hit by an African and many others. The portions <br /> <br /> The direction of Manoj Agrawal is fine The music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda proves once again that he is one of the most visible actors. As always, he is a fan even though he has played those roles before fitting in all the shoots and roles, here also the roles of 6 to 7 are not so good. Rani's gang seems fat, joins well with Govinda, that's it. Nothing good and I kept doing that kind of role Between the rest Nirmal Pandey is as always Johny Lever is too loud sometimes and funny in places in 1 role and irritates like the old Tinnu Anand is fine Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is fine Tanaaz is all right
