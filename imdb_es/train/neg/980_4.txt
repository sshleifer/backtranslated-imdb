My first full movie of Heston. The film to which everyone already knows the end. A "science fiction thriller". The countryside factor. Everything that accompanies this film was injected into my head when I rented it, and on the morning that I saw it, it was the perfect movie to see in the mood I was in (I did not want to move.) Put in the player, hide in blankets). And although I tried to understand what was happening to bring it to the end that will be forever ruined by pop culture, it really did not make it. Everything was everywhere, relationships had no spine, the end had no advantage. Everything was as if it were there in some strange way and the observer has no choice but to go partially stupefied at the end to which it arrives, because even though we all know that it is people, they are quick answers as to WHY it is that people make a serious attempt to enjoy the movie for something other than stupidity thrown out the window.
