I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I realize why. The performance was the worst I've seen in a long time. Lighting and sound are of poor quality at best. The plot does not make much sense even when you are sober (WARNING: I do not advise watching this movie when you are sober). This movie seems to be watching the home movie of someone who does not come out much. It really is a pity that all the little money spent on this project has become a waste, I hope to see if any of the wraps still have a career, apart from Eva Longoria, who is the only "star" of this movie. that apparently was not hit with the bad acting club. I regret that none of these criticisms seem constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill: do not try again. In the words of squirlyem "His severe lack in the good department".
