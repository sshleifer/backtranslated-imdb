As someone who has read the book, I can say that this is far inferior to the great American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are many reasons for this. First of all, Emma is too disgusting. Yes, she has flaws and is not the easiest person to please, but the viewer should not begin to despise her. Second, Mr. Knightly is a mistake. His melancholy and melancholy in this version adapt better to an adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than Austen, and they awaken the mood of the whole affair. Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; And why did they make her look so sick? Harriet is supposed to be blond and blooming, not to look like the next scene will consume her. Fourth, the structure has been discarded and the scenes cut. In the end, when Emma decides that she loves Mr. Knightly, she is completely disconcerting because this narrative has not been shown or adequately shown throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly was happening with Mrs. Elton's accent? It went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to everything that was American midway, and then back to English at the end. Finally, it is dragged at the end. The book and the great version of the film end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly. This version is confusingly prolonged after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> In general, a rather random attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version.
