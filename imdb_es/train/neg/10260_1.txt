This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and I knew it was a bomb. The performance was bad and there was no plot. The monster is so fake. the mouth does not move. Also, why would they have a doctor who would play a xylophone to kill the monster? Simply bad, do not even waste your time (1 out of 10)
