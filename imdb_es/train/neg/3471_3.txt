This movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was not seriously trying to act in any way, shape or form. He directly sucked. Nothing about the movie was credible. The first problems were in the introduction, where the man gives everything that has value to the Salvation Army of Santa Claus, but does not show why. And then Grandma sticks her head in the oven, really beautiful, and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, does not even have the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation of Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the house he chose; there was no credible reaction from the family he chose; and people get carried away here and there with no reason to do so (example: the characters of Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck slide down a steep slope, this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him.) Riiiight ...) Anyway, there were one or two fun moments, but they were a rarity in the movie. Seriously I needed another rewrite (or 4). I hope you enjoy it!
