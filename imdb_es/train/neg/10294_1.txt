Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then the characters without personality do not develop. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning or middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful photos that do not become beautiful because they are not even allowed, because this movie is not even. There is no "is" in this movie because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or period. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the movie itself is such that watching it is not worth it, so if you're really interested, I suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something like that. You will get everything you can from this movie without the fatigue, the headache and the impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
