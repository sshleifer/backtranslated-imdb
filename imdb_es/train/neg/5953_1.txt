How has this piece of junk been on television for so long? It's terrible. I want to shoot someone. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie from the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than see this nonsense. I remember seeing it when it first came out. I thought: Hey, this could be interesting, then I discovered how absolutely, incredibly ridiculous and stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually pulled out my pocket knife and put my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> Please, people, stop watching this and all the other reality shows, they are the trash that is clogging the networks. and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.
