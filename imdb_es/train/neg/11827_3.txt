I just returned from a free screening and I am very happy that I did not pay to see this movie well below average. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. However, it seemed that it was only the children who laughed at all the jokes and jokes (oh my God, they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). The film is quite young, unintelligent, predictable and mostly annoying. It seems that the characters come together to fill an empty space and the relationships between them seemed very forced without any kind of charm. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is almost normal and nothing stands out. They did a decent job imitating the muddy appearance of Wallace and Gromit, but apart from that they are very forgettable images. <br /> <br /> Although I was very bored throughout the movie, I chuckled a couple of times. It's not an absolute failure, but I definitely would not want to see it again. If you are a father with children (and you do not mind that your children see cheap jokes without meaning), feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else should not lose their money.
