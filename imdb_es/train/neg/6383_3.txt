Gayniggers from Outer Space is a foreign short film about blacks, foreign homosexuals who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon the Earth. Being homosexual, your goal is to have a universe only for men in which all people are homosexual. Therefore, when they discover that women or "female creatures" live on Earth, at first they are terrified; finally, they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist story, although probably intended as a satire, gives this movie a bit of an impact. However, there is little substance underneath. As another critic pointed out, there are few jokes besides the names of the characters (for example, ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at a little gay joke. I think I quickly understood the point of the film, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had had enough; I kept wanting the film to end (and it's a short film!). Not bright or particularly well written.
