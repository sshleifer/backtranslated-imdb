I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can not understand why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some in the summary of the plot says "but what Satan does not know is that he is stuck with annoying tourists" Well, they did not seem to bother him in the movie, only me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing About this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was just boring.
