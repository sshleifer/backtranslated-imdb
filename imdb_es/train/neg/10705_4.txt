Maverick policeman with family problems and fond of using his weapon? Check! Isolated place with valuable object that is asking to be stolen? Check! Interesting love interest? Check! Variety of fools bands cartridges cartridges of villains with unreliable European accents. Check! A bad boy who sounds German played by an English actor with a piece of cheesy dialogue for every occasion? Check! Corny one liners ?? Check it! <br /> <br /> My dear, is this movie so small or what? The clichés are as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stares at the sight of how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a blatantly cheap and joyful direct to the video of Die Hard alone On a mountain (complete with some lines cut from the aforementioned) we have all the usual action moves, clichés are progressively accelerated as We moved forward with a bit of old-fashioned violence and nudity to awaken anyone in the audience that might have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the complete cop in John McClane mode here, who even gets time for the bad guy with the gun to use all his bullets at some point. <br /> <br /> In the midst of this mess, there are some well-known recognizable faces that I can only assume that they needed the money and / or simply played it out of laughter from the useless initial scene that had nothing to do with the plot absolutely. The final conclusion unlikely complete with a cordial dialogue and even a riskier tone. Cts. <br /> <br /> When seeing these three quid of the effort of the supermarket bargain in IMDb, I am surprised that this error has generated not one but two sequels. I have to find these gems on DVD! It seems that the first sequel is a scam of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, well you know! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with each movie and even the character's name seems to change for the third installment. <br /> <br /> However, the blind purchases of cheap DVDs simply would not be the same if the studios did not continue trotting material of this horrible quality!
