I'm a big fan of B5, having reached only at the end of the third season. I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most thoughtful arcs in history to hit television. Even the filler episodes were interesting. The films, too, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to get to the theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the "River of souls". Naturally, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be acting in an Ed Wood movie instead of a serious science fiction story. The story itself could have looked good in the form of a schema, even to the story board. However, he obviously suffers when it was time to complete this idea in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where obviously they lacked time and simply improvised the dialogue to complete the story. If this had done the regular season, it would have ranked among the worst episodes.
