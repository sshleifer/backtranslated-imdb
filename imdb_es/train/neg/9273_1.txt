The first question that comes to mind after seeing this garbage is: who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name Omen in this movie? It is a shambolic, shameful and pathetic attempt to continue with the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the background music sounds as if it had been taken directly from a Bugs Bunny cartoon and, from that moment, the movie got worse. I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E, when they took it to show it to their teacher! After a while, it is difficult to know if it is a comedy, because what happens is very funny and, therefore, is not true to the originality it engenders. The acting is ridiculous, especially of the protagonist Faye Grant. She keeps making faces or do you find it hard not to laugh? It is difficult to tell. The worst consequence I have had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10
