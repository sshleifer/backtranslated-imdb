Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros at the cinema to see this superficial film without meaning. My points; <br /> <br /> The movie is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic point of view: as in most American films, the writer considers himself as an expert. After learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods does not make a person understand a culture. For example, shaving is the sign of a clean life in Asia, but everyone was trying to get the girl to stop him. The Lebanese are Christians (ok, they understood) and their forms, beliefs and cultural approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not ethnocentrism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our life as did the father figure in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is not much to say about it. Show me 10 girls who had this in their sexual awakening of which I will say that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please see Dr. Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black c√°lculoER must reflect the truth restoration and he has to focus on the ojos habitaciones .undary. Where is the truth Where is the meaning of the movie.
