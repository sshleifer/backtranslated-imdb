The film had a good performance and good times (although obviously a fairly low budget), but a bad rating because the basic premise is poorly developed. The main point of conflict between the two drivers does not develop in a realistic way at all. There are some scenes in which you disagree because of that, but there are no deep discussions that explain how you can be together to see the world so differently, especially because Glenn's employment is very present in this part of his life. lifetime. (and Adam is active enough to support him with time and money). In addition, several times, Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizes to Adam for his past), while showing that Adam is honest and "traditional." , "that the film claims to be the" good "final form, I do not like being preached to, I attended a discussion session with the director after seeing the LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said that in real life he is related to Glenn's opinion), that he could never date someone with Adam's opinions ... Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film, and the director said he directed this, his first film, just after reading (Directing Dummies) The direction was not so bad, but it is far from being a first class effort. worse things, but I rarely leave the movies feeling so frustrated.
