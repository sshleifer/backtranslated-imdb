The director Sidney J. Furie has created in Hollow Point a absurd postmodern masterpiece that constantly challenges and surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to wonder what happens with the traditional traditional paradigms tired of "plot" and "characterization" when the crutches of "motivation" and "reason" are eliminated. <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this movie makes sense, law enforcement officers are totally unpleasant and organized criminals are completely crazy.
