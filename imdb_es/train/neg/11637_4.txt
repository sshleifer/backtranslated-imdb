Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create an adaptation of the game that is at least somewhat faithful to the game; has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content in a film full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we're still dealing with Uwe Boll, so do not expect the movie to be really good. While it has its moment, "Postal" wears its welcome very quickly and becomes a nuisance to sit on. <br /> <br /> In its essence, Postal is a satire in the United States, as did a twelfth. One-year-old Boll seems to think that the offensive is linearly proportional to the comic value: the more offensive, more fun, and more exaggerated the more fun. This results in a film that establishes new levels of lack of flavor while being extremely unpredictable. Yes, some gags work but it seems to be pure luck. The highest points include the director satirizing himself, and the people who are violently beaten by trucks and other vehicles. The low points include ... well, almost everything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise fades, Postal simply becomes boring to watch. Yes, there is a good joke every ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters that are fired and chased all over the place for what seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> This has probably worked like a short movie, but it's not enough for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are good ideas and good intentions, but they are irretrievably lost in scenes of endless and meaningless action and content that is offensive only for the good 4/10
