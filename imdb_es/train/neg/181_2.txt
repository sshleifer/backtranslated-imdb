Ah, channel 5 of the Mexican local t.v. Every day, at 2:00 a.m., they broadcast horror movies from the 70s in the early 2000s. It was "Return to Cabin by The Lake," the movie that aired yesterday. I regret having seen it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a popular low budget and was widely accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film in some points seems like a soap opera due to its absurd dialogue, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this at all costs. It is a movie that should not be seen by anyone. Not even for mediocre movie lovers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
