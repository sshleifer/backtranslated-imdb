I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with those parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie in history. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain of the Power Rangers. and it has approximately the same range of rubber movement. This could be fine if the manufacturers were not as proud of their design as they seem to be. That is, for a man in a large rubber suit in an action / science fiction / horror movie that could benefit from some mystery, the shark has a lot of screen time. Of course, it is usually unstable and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume it's so scary that even the camera guy goes crazy. <br /> <br /> The camera is aimed at a person who is about to be devoured, the camera shark. The camera returns to the person who is about to eat, only now they are screaming and without arms. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costumes are bad, the acting is bad, and the special effects are below average, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can eat, or for something to explode. Because WE'RE GOING TO KNOW, the people who made this movie definitely came in with more explosions = more mentality. The characters shoot the cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHAT, all explode, so much that the damn shark even explodes at the end. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that someone would think that trying to make a half giant person half-shark have sex with a woman to do that The babies of the freaky shark people are a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The trouble is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its evil is not really enough to sustain a prolonged interest of the person. It may be a good option for MST3K with your friends, but beyond that, if you meet this bad guy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
