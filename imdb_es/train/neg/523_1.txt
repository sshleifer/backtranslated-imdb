I'm surprised what happens today for entertainment. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, and I'm out of touch with today's movie generation, and that's apparently the case with this film, since a lot of people loved it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I have not said that about many movies in my life, but it fits perfectly. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and I even found the jokes of homosexuals, not only not funny but frankly offensive (I'm not gay). The main character of the film is not even a nice person, just pathetic. When the movie finally ended, I heard several people comment on how disappointed they were of what they had just paid to see.
