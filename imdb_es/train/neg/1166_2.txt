Having seen Versus before, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Vivo did not deliver. Very slow development Potential loads with the cast and fresh visual effects. The premise was intriguing, but the reward did not compensate for the accumulation. I could have done much more in the end. Most of the movie is simply "sitting". To put it bluntly, three of us were prepared to sit down and watch this movie and in the 50th minute we strive to get to the end. I really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for fights like Ichi the Killer or Versus, save yourself $ and a lot of disappointments.
