Dr. Tarr's Dungeon Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon discovers that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is in charge of the patients, and the doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are simply boring and just make you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks it's a chicken, for example). I have to admit that the story is pretty good, but the movie itself is a bomb. The music of the film is really strange and like something that would be heard in a crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene that involves dancing to the chicken coops, which made me want to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rating: R for violence and nudity.
