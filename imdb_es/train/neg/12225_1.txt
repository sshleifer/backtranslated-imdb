My personal vision of hell is to be locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and make this film play for all eternity on every surface available in that room. The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man just begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous the premise of this film is. The most important thing about watching a movie is the concept of "being willing to suspend disbelief". . . It is impossible to do that in this movie.
