This film is defective on many fronts. Like many others before, it portrays more of the Alamo mythology than of history. The production is poor and, in general, gives the impression of a welfare project for many actors who might have had to work in Hollywood Squares. For me, this was the biggest flaw. I know that the ages and general personalities of the true protagonists of Alamo and the geriatric ensemble of television actors chosen to portray them never allow any hint of credibility to be hinted at. <br /> <br /> As a Texan native, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about the story. I can accept a decent production from any perspective (although I prefer more historical precision), but this never gave me the opportunity to enjoy it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this solid mess, although they are only a little less precise. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing: avoid it.
