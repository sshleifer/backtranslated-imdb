1ยบ seen 2/28/2006 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version that I saw entitled "3 Days of the Condor" - So the CIA drama is full of relaxed performances that make it very relaxed movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 of the 8 members of a CIA research group that was killed with the character of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, being the one that remained. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to discover while trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. On the way, it involves the character of Faye Dunaway, originally because she needs a place to hide, and then she finally helps him after a moment of love. This is one of a handful of innocent people in career stories, but this one does not have much suspense. Flat performances do not help and the finish does not seal the deal for the audience either. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the performances are not what they should be and, therefore, the film is not what it should be.
