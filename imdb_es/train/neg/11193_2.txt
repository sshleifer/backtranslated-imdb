Okay, I did not have many expectations, but this movie descended to depths I could not imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, involved a priest of an obscure 2-member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a devourer of sins. The devourer of sins allows Catholics to achieve salvation outside the authority of the Church and is another immortal in the cinema with lots of boring. It does not matter that this does not make sense, since a Baptist could give you salvation ... we will carry on. <br /> <br /> I will design the plot without giving much: the priest goes to Rome With his friend to investogate. He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not inventing it) who shot him during an excoriation and who loves him (nothing is explained about this, by the way), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as a cardinal. They arrive in Rome, they find some scary children who do nothing in the film, they meet an anti-papa S & M slavery team that the Irish drunk knows (does not explain) and who gives information killing people (oh, by the way, it's a bad guy, so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. The plot snakes around. Heath cools off with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater to spend a night and then other things happen and then (all off camera) the antipope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> About 1 hour in the movie one really wonders if something has happened. In the end, something has happened, but you can not be sure it is important and, since most of the drama takes place either before the move or misplaced, you really feel cheated.
