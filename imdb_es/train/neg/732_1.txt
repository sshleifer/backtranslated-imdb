A child sees how they kill their mother and hang their father. 20 years later, he gets a group of friends to perform an exorcism on himself, so that he does not leave like his father. All stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the "funny" guy the hard hood (but sensitive); the smart girl (she wears glasses, that's how we know); The nerd and two blondes without personality. Everything involves a stupid wooden statue that comes to life (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a great opening scene, we jumped 20 years later. ALL horror movies do that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except for Betsy Palmer, why Betsy?) And the murders are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people supposedly have sex and the statue pulls the boy from the bed to show that he is fully dressed! A really bad, stupid and incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
