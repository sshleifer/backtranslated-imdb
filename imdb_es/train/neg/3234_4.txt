Well, how do you rate a movie like this? Does it even really have cinematic value? It is a film that tries to approach as much as possible to be a snuff movie. Basically, the whole movie is purely a group of boys who torture a girl. It is not very attractive and, besides that, it is not so realistic either. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film tried to be as realistic and as impressive as possible. However, the film is too false to work as it should be. The slap and the daze is all soft and false, as well as the sound. They are often simply kicking on the ground, instead of the girl, obviously. Also the way in which the girl responds to all the torments is quite docile. I mean, if this were real, surely she would have shouted it. However, there are more cries than cries in this. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously low budget and is a brave attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. I do not really think that this movie had a big impact at the time it was released, although it should have done something right, since a total of six sequels were released after it. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and Gore will probably be disappointed by this movie, although there are still some fetishists who are going to have fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
