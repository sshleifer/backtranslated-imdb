In fact, we saw it twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we had missed something ... well no, what was missing had been lost since the beginning of preproduction. In fact, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting in the past now is a lot of disconnected things and blurry head rubbish. <br /> <br /> Then, the initial problem with the film was decided to do it, and the rest of the train collision progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works, it is not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photographs are overwhelmed by the random placement of the camera in interior shots. All the actors look, at least, uncomfortable (Angie Dickenson looks absolutely mortified), except Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that he is too unconscious to realize how horrible his performance is. The dialogue is one, long, incessant tremble. The scenes have no meaning from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the film continues blindly, convinced that it is saying something profound. <br /> <br /> This is too bad to be funny; It is simply unbearable. Gus Van Zant has made other excellent films that I encourage you to watch, and I am happy that he survived (and it seems he has learned from this disaster).
