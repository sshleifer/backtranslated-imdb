I completely agree with Jamrom4. This was the most horrible movie I've seen in my life. Holy shit, it was terrible. They warned me not to see her ... And foolishly I saw her anyway, about 10 minutes of the painful experience I gave up completely to see the atrocity ... but I remained seated until the end ... just to see if I could ... well, I did it and now I wish I had not done it ... it was disgusting ... nothing happened and the ending was all the predicates ... no movie that has the right to survive ... I implore you all you can save yourself the terror of the fat impulses in the bus ... if only you had heard the same warning ... please, save yourself from this movie ... I have the feeling that those who rated it in an important way were involved in the making of the film ... and they should be erased from the face of the planet ...
