TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the USA. UU In the 20s during the filming of the first version of DeMille of the 10 Commandments and that is reawakened when DeMille sets are unearthed in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is: were the filmmakers serious or joking when they made this movie? If this is serious, it is a ridiculously bad movie and a great movie to choose because of its evil. If it's a comedy, it's less good but fun for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh a lot in this movie, probably more than many other "comedies" in Hollywood.
