This is not a terrible comedy, but it's very crowded. He barely laughs and wastes his luxurious production values. There is a poignant moment near the end, when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him that "You have been my only worthy adversary, and now we can start again." That scene, however, along with Burt Kwouk's funny cameo at the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
