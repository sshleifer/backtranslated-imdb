What else can be said about this movie, except that it's just awful? Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why you see this, but that's all, but your talents are wasted on this crap. I think they used a double in some of Adam's scenes, like when he's running because you can not see his face. If Adam were ashamed to be in Zombie Nightmare, just think about what he must have felt when he appeared in this. If it was sooner or later, I'm not sure, but even so, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (look at the first and last version of Mystery Science Theater 3000) compared to this. The gang is very annoying and exaggerated by some. of the actors. A scam by The Wild One, starring Marlon Brando, of course. Although Tina looks impressive. I hope she and Adam received a good paycheck! Happen!
