The truth is that a film based on a novel by Harold Robbins will not win any prize. This is not an exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B image in budget, distribution and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie made for television. The acting is very uneven. Jos√© Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is a shame. As one critic of a certain performance of Katherine Hepburn said, her rank goes from A to B. Mrs. Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. However, everything can be very funny in a trashy way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for some fun ... and you are not too sober ... this could be for you.
