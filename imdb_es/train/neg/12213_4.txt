Like 'First Blood', this tries to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam veterans, but there really is not much time for that between the monotonous shots, the fires, the stabbings, the tortures and the explosions like an impossibly Rambo Indestructible takes half of Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, several vehicles and anything else you can aim with a rocket launcher. The only woman in the midst of all these children's toys is soon hit, which allows testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully looks after all the clich√© themes of the Russian rat-a-tat to the Chinese ching-chang-chong, just in case we do not understand well who we look at, provides us with useful information. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him.
