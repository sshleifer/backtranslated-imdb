After seeing the trailer for this film in the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for a suspense movie, placing it in the competitive world of computer companies. The cast of stars was another message that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not go to see him in his first week of release, then he disappeared in week 2, I was afraid something was a flaw. Patiently I waited for its release on DVD, then I bought it running home for a pleasant evening. The anticipation on the way home was much better than the movie. To begin with, the address is atrocious. He has not thought of anything and the director only becomes a part of himself, so that he can appear in the film. I would not rush to use it in the future. Second, the main role is completely wrong as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually a cool character like Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but in this he is supposed to be a clumsy hero who tries to portray slipping when he runs and has geeky friends, but he does not look good. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani do not have enough, but when they do, none of the performances is near their best level. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been created for him and it is his genius of fire and his mysterious ways that drag the film. The final point is that this movie is another that fills the trailer with scenes that you do not see in the movie and instead appears only in the section of scenes deleted from the DVD. Causing even more disappointment, because although some of these scenes are raw, they do fill important gaps in the story.
