!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> While watching the first half of GUILTY AS SIN, I could not believe it was made in 1993 because he played as a clone of JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas since the mid 80s. It begins with a murder and is left for the public to reflect on: "Are you guilty or innocent and will you go to bed with your lawyer?" But in the middle of the film they show their credentials from the early 90s by becoming a "attorney". manipulated and harassed by the type of film of his client, which ends in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous end in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very poor thriller, but the most unforgivable. is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet, the same man who brought us the classic drama of all times in room 12 ANGRY MEN
