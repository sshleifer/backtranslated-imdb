Another scam on FRIDAY THE 13th, even with part of their music! A group of young adults meets for a small high school reunion and begins to be massacred at the height of Jason Voorhees. Could it be that the nerds that used to torment in school? <br /> <br /> The slash-fest routine is fun for fans of the genre, and it contains the usual T & A quota for movies, if not. The ending is a little more imaginative than your standard launcher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Classified by violence / blood, language, sexuality, nudity and drug content.
