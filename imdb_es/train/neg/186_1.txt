I did not know whether to laugh or cry at this distortion of Canadian history, particularly the damage to the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> I leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive story of the Klondike Gold Rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896- 1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an indomitable frontier, submitted by individual heroes armed with six cannons, continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the western United States. United, this time Wyoming, which turned its herd of cattle into the country of gold. The image is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruence is the main assumption on which the plot revolves. that there was only one cop mounted throughout the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lack of law. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs house is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the sheriff?" asks Brennan. <br /> <br /> "Up on the Pelly River. Problems with the chilkats, "someone answers, he has a really hard job, that sheriff, he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles, sometimes he does not get home for two or three months at a time." <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that Yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state that British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in a considerable number long before the Klondike strike. They controlled all the routes to the Yukon and did not accept nonsense. They collected customs duties, often for the laments of the newcomers, made arbitrary laws on river navigation and returned the men if they did not have enough supplies or if they just looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they established moral laws for the community. In Dawson, the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut its wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern-faced police called "giving a daring performance in the theater," usually nothing more than dance suggestively on stage in too revealing pantyhose. <br /> <br /> In such a community, a gun belt was unthinkable. A notorious villain in Tombstone who tried to pack a gun in his hip was personally disarmed by a young agent, who had expelled him from a room for the atrocious crime of speaking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb, but protested when the policeman, upon discovering that he was carrying a gun, told him to hand it over. "No man has taken a gun from me," the American said. "Well, I'll take it," the agent said softly and did, without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for only a dollar and bought as souvenirs to keep them on the mantelpiece. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the great year of the stampede, there was. Was not it a serious crime? let alone murder? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, Denver's trusted man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country, Dawson is seen as a lawless community, what is the Skagway character of Soapy Smith? His name is Gannon in the photo? can easily control (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border was confiscated all his equipment and a police sergeant mounted on his back returned him to his back). <br /> <br /> {In the movie, the lonely Mountie says} "Yes, I am the law, I represent the law in the Yukon Territory, about fifty thousand square miles of it." <br /> <br /> "Then, why is not there more of you?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday it was a desert, we did not expect you to arrive by the thousands, now that you are here, we will protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "There will be a publication set up here in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? Will he be here to maintain order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. " <br /> <br /> "What about the rest of the time?" <br /> <br /> "Choose a good man, swear him in. Does he act as a marshal?" <br /> <br /> The movie Mountie goes away and does not appear again in the image. His amazing suggestion? That a US city marshal, complete with a tin star, be sworn in by a group of citizens living under British jurisprudence? It is accepted. Naturally, they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal; He clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of a loner who takes care of number one and that's why another man is chosen to be shot. And he does it Others are shot. Even Walter Brennan is shot. Stewart finally arrives at the reluctant conclusion that he must finish all the shots with some own shots. He looks at the tin star and he and the stalker, Gannon, shoot themselves in the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> For anyone with a knowledge of northern Canada, this bald re-telling of The Story passes rational belief. <br /> <br />?
