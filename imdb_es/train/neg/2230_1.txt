If you want to see an expert in Karate homosexual delayed hitting a group of Mexican gangsters who try hard to try several times an hour, then this is the movie for you. If not, choose another DVD from the 20c container, which is the only place this movie belongs to. The acting was so horrible that I had to force myself to see it until the end. The cover makes it look so great, but it's just another cheap gangster movie a key grade B in the line of 2 g and bloody streetz and threat. Not buy or would rent this movie unless you're planning apedrearse and draw, edit and act really does not care. It is truly the worst movie in the history of mankind!
