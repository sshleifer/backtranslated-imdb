There were some scary scenes, which I've always liked more than direct gore, but otherwise this movie was pretty weak. There were too many unanswered questions, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still unclear. After watching this movie he still seemed lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. That movie was also unsatisfactory, but even better than this because it tried to work and the story really made sense. This, not so much. <br /> <br /> The performance for the most part in Abandoned was decent, but the film went on and never gave any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, there were some spooky scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a disaster. I'm sorry, I can not recommend it.
