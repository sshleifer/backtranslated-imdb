The romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the love relationship that grows between an attractive hippie (Kay Lenz) and a Los Angeles real estate agent in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly affable within this highly invented arrangement). The script is light but not without some reflexive passages; even so, the scenario is a middle-aged clich√© at this point that most of the image appears as childish. It may have worked much better with different clues: Holden and Lenz do not mix well (their stature is so slight that it seems to rise above it), making their intimate scenes less moving than simply uncomfortable. Dated, fuzzy-romantic, and mostly not memorable. ** since ****
