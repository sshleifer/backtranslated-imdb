The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was going to be a good sasquatch movie. Usually, when you have these types of movies, there is usually ONE sasquatch, but in this one there is what? 7 or 10 of them? The acting was good, the plot was good, I liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first victims, very good work with the camera. I expected it to be a bloody movie but it was very small. This movie was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more sasquatch movies, I mean I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm reviewing is fine, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I'm not reviewing it. Let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for any other occasion, no.
