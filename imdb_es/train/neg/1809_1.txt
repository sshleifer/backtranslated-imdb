There is nothing that I hate more than the self-complacency of pretense. Kevin Smith deserves to be hanging on his toenails to inspire all white middle-class people who want to make a movie about why they can not have sex. I do not really care about inexperience and low budget productions, but when the writing is so obvious and cloying, it really burns my potatoes. The money invested in this could have been destined to a true filmmaker with difficulties who has an opportunity like John Gulager. If you see the Greenlight Project, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who fights the system. Anyone can grab a camera and make a talkative image that does not really say anything. When will we be saved from the Herrononites and gedonetas of the world? The revolution can not come soon enough. Go see for the first time a real effort buying Desperado or looking for Friends with Benefits. Thank you and good morning.
