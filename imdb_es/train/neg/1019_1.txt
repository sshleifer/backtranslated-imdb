Honestly, before watching this movie, I had heard many people say that this movie was a disgrace. I did not believe it, since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took roles in this movie and saw it on my own. Apparently they were right. I was very disappointed and I was wondering all the time during the movie: why the hell did I see this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect much from Justin, since he does not really belong in the movie / theater. deal. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not help wondering why the hell they agreed to participate in Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think that if the players stink, then you should pay more attention to the story. In fact, this story is the core of a movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to give credit for its history. Imagine this, a smart journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and, at the same time, learned to become a "real" journalist for his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant researcher (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> My God, I could not even continue with this. Just remembering the movie is already making me sick. I advise you guys, do not look at this! Please save your money and time for another movie.
