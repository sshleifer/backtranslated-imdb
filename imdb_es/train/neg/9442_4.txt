I tried to like this slasher, as I try to enjoy all slasher movies. I mean a senseless murder mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you make a mistake? But I think that Unhinged is an example that that formula went wrong. The main problem is the horrible performance of the three main girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and that prevented me from being interested in their situation. The film points to the suspense and the chilling, but the direction of the numbers exhausts it, and leaves the film quite boring. It's a shame, because if the movie had been better executed, it would have been an ace. The story and the characters are quite spooky and there are dark and strangely funny moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There is some good nudity, and occasional bloody splashes, but not enough to give the movie the kick it needed. The ending is quite twisted and scary, and it gives the movie a big boost but, unfortunately, it's too little too late. Therefore, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love the dark films of Slasher. There is a lot of potential, but the film offers very little to be worth.
