The drivers of racing cars say that the 100 miles per hour seems fast until you have driven 150, and the 150 miles per hour seems fast until you have driven 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog looks awesome strange until you've seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems incredibly strange until you've seen Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten seems incredibly strange until you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. To the fans of the race, there is NOTHING in the world of cinema like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> Alabama's Ghost is about as close as any of its films to having a coherent storyline, and it only involves the hippies. Rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, which crosses the Sunset District in San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> What is really amazing is that someone gave you A LOT of money to do the Alabama Phantom. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, many and many effects. Somehow that makes the Alabama ghost so wrong. You see a horrible cheese ball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the rarity is excusable on the grounds that they were obviously making the movie out of space on their Discover cards. But the Alabama Phantom was made with a real budget, and that is BAD. I mean, I have a script about a tribe of cannibals that live in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the Twizzlers forest, and no one is banging MY door by waving a checkbook: how did this guy get the funds for FOUR? the skinniest movies ever made?
