This is one of the most putrid movies of the 90s. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This image presents African-Americans as wild sociopaths, uncultured, violent, inarticulate and smoldering. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his group of homies are continually disrespectful towards others in the bedroom, not only whites, but also Asians, and are never disciplined by their actions. Despite all that tolerance, they keep whining and crying for the evil white oppressors who manage their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it is Fudge's influence that makes Remmy join the heads of the skin, drop out of college and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads present themselves as an undercover group of low-achieving people who share a leave campus and, generally, stay away from everyone else. They never play their music to annoy people or make fun of the police. They commit serious crimes, such as assault and rape, but they are not as repulsive or as threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of material in this movie that almost offends. I made myself laugh Some of them are the following below. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads appear as students at the University of Columbus, but we never see them in class and it is not entirely clear how they pay tuition. It only remains to speculate that the weeds they smoke have something to do with their finances. Although they are students in what appears to be a private university, they can not pronounce a single line of adequate English. His characters develop only through their compulsive moans and their xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems that the drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunk Billy was taking her home. She even asked him to get a rubber band so they could start. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape, whereas it would be a good sex only if he had one at hand. Later, Kristen assured Taryn (Jennifer Connely) that she was not responsible in that matter, and that despite intentionally jumping into a boy's bed, she was not prepared to have sex and was brutally exploited by a sexual predator. Then, about a week later, he met and slept with an ultra sensitive maker who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The director emphasized in-depth contraception. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and complete garbage that makes black people look like punctures and women look stupid and fragile. The performance of Cole Hauser and the accent of Laurence Fishburne are the only reasons I can think of to see it. The writer / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Move forward and limit yours watching this shit if you want, but keep in mind that the neurons do not grow back. Simply follow the tips at the end and UNLEASH.
