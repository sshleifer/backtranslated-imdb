Truly a disgusting, vile movie, with only a small amount of real humor. <br /> <br /> The character of the father in particular is extremely vulgar (intentionally, obviously), and portrayed in the most pathetic, sordid way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film terribly disturbing, with absolutely no redeeming feature. Frankly, I wish I had never seen him. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort a sick and serious shame. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this movie have a skill that I totally lack. : to rejoice in a show of deep depravity and misery. <br /> <br /> Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
