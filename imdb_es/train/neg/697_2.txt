The two things are good about this movie, they are two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and flexible, with an appearance that still covers her body today, steals the beginning, which is all she is in, and that's all. Obviously, she is just beginning because her performance improved with her upcoming projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the score of the well-known composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what prevents this stinky person from getting a star ... yes I know that one more star is not much, but in the case of this movie, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid, mindless horror of a couple of college students trying to clean a bedroom that is due to being knocked down, torn apart one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah. .. we all know where this is going. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
