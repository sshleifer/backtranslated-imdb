This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the hammy acting. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a homework project from the film school, but it was certainly played as such. It is not even particularly successful in its central idea of ​​trying to appear as one continuous shot. The horizontal pans of the camera are a cheap and unoriginal way to hide the cuts.
