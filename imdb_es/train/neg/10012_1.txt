This movie must be online for the most boring movie in years. Harrison can not even prevent this movie from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the murder in this movie is the point of interest of this film, but it is not, nothing is of interest. The cast is not all bad, but the script is just horrible, I just sat in total amazement during this movie, thinking about how someone can find this movie entertaining <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very smart . They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses in their cast. People will go to box office success and probably watch this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this should be good and rent this movie. (Guys, they're in a horrible moment) <br /> <br /> If you like to get ripped off and rent this movie, some people liked this movie, but I like to watch a movie with meaning.
