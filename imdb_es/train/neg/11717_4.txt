Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Le√≥n, then other parts felt like other movies, I do not know which, but there is a familiar feeling throughout the film. It was nice to see it, but it would have been fantastic! If the story had been more original. The little girl, bad assassin of Leon, is a little modified. The first scenes are very good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the cinema :-) My biggest problem was remembering which parts were from Leon, Nikita and if they were from the French or American version. . If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best Regards / Rick
