Let's be honest: the only reason someone bought this, the only reason someone checked it and the only reason someone could claim to enjoy it is because David Lynch did it and because he wants to have David Lynch's children . But guess that? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch would like you to overcome normality and experience the absurdity itself as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps it is assumed that the atrocious, the sounds of the cacophonists and the visuals of the scratches imply something about the place that humanity occupies in the world, about our relationship with the real, about the absurdity of everything. <br /> <br /> Instead, just one thing tells me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted offensive offensive, I could rip off Hansen at full speed and let me bleed for the ears If I wanted something absurd for the sake of the absurd, I could just throw a plate on a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a unique redemption quality for Dumbland: it's goal, goal funny. I mean, it's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. However, this fact is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself the agony.
