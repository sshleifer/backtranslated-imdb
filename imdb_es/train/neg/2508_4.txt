It was time to release this movie on DVD. I know some say that WB hastens the release of this film because of the movie The Dreamgirls. But how can you speed up the release of a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, without any special feature, without 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do much better than this. The quality of image and audio in this movie needs serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems that WB did not devote so much time and attention to this film because it is a black film and I have good sales. They could have saved the CD which, by the way, does not have all the songs that the original CD has. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to go to add some more special feature. Take notes of other group movies, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation where you can see only the performance, and the sound of both is much, much, much better than this DVD.
