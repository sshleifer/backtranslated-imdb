As the number of Video Nasties that I have not yet seen decreases, this small pile of garbage appeared on my "rentals" list when I saw that it was available. <br /> <br /> The premise is a fashion model or something being hijacked and taken to the jungle to be rescued by a group of idiots. Another fool is hired to bring her back and she is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, although if she returns with the girl and all the money, she gets a significant cut. He has brought a helicopter and a pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors in history! Of course, all of them are totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After robbing us in the jungle, we learn that nearby there is a cannibalistic cult whose carnal god of the earth wanders through the forest like a human King Kong in search of tribes that plunder and devour. Now, this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeups, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's it. Their grunts and grunts are a feature always present in the soundtrack, and I found myself silencing many of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was banned, although there is a specific scene, about a second long, in which the god attacks a girl and disregards, but it is not a redeeming factor for the fans of the movie. Gore In addition, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual in T and A and shows long close-ups of the female genitalia and, unfortunately, is also male. So, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you have it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this garbage to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just an excruciatingly cushioned garbage that only a Nasty Video fan will probably see, and even then, if it's making its way through the list, leave it to the end. If you look at it first, you may have the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
