I have never seen a movie in such a short time. The only salvation was the fast-forward function in the DVD drive. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC movie. Obviously, there was no money for the lighting, the shooting, the sets, the location, the writers, the editors, the actors ... Oh, there was no story either! I need to write ten lines of comments ... Bad, horrible, horrible, miserable, agonizing, tortuous, bilious, nauseous, sickly, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, desolate, stinking, stinking, vile, dreary, everything - many down, and I do not know if I can keep going to complete the ten lines of how bad this piece of fucking-o-matic production was!
