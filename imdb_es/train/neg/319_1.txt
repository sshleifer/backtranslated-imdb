A friend of mine bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then it was too expensive. Despite having big names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as fun as pulling a chisel and hitting it directly through his ear. He uses tired, comic book techniques at the back of the canyon: he constantly breaks the fourth wall when Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly useless assemblies of "hot girls". <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise Who wants to do it as a successful comedian to succeed with women? When the resident comedian of the ship, blatantly named 'Dickie' because of his unfathomable success with the opposite sex, is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character, Shecker, gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's quite locked in the bathroom, probably dizzy. <br /> <br /> Maybe from his mouth he simply vomited the worst movie of all time.
