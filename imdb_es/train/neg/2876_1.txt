I question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the motives of the BTK murderer. Are you trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not you think that the people involved with this monster are suffering enough? What a blatant lack of respect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: what bothers you the most, the slaughterhouse or the human murders? They used the real names of some of the victims ... this movie was frightening, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
