Look, I'm sorry if half the world is offended by this, but life is confusing enough. I do not need to see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even saw Fracture, and I knew it would be a smoking stack of Quentin. But this is not well thrown away, and it's not daring, even if it's artistic. Well produced films have reasons for quick cuts and edits, this excuse is not "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation". This will make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving image that has ever got you anywhere. I still love AH, and I will always give him another chance, but if you do not have time to see bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
