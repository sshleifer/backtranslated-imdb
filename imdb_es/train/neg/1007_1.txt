It was very difficult for me to see this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to hold 45-50 minutes before turning it off with disgust and watching Monster House (which, by the way, is very fun). <br /> <br /> The story has huge holes. The plot line is way over and it's boring, the acting is horrible, especially by Justin TImberlake, who really should stick to what is good (look silly and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman was incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he made himself dance around rock music for no apparent reason in the middle of the movie after he and Timberlake met. It seems that the characters of Freeman and Timberlake are supposed to have some type of father / son relationship or something like that, which is simply not obvious, apart from the fact that; Although the character of Freeman seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never stops to help him discover a completely ridiculous cover-up. <br /> <br /> Incredible suspension of disbelief to give credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a pure waste of time.
