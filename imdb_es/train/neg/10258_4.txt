The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a lot of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has said since that he was tricked into appearing in this by his producers who told him there were many important actors involved) is Padre Pergado and can do his usual routine, serious and terrifying. The cast is not so bad, although most have already withdrawn from the performance. The movie has terrible sound effects (created mainly by pressing the keys on an old computer) and sometimes reflects ridiculously: it shows a scene from the sky, for example, for what feels like hours at a time. Despite this, the story is quite humorous in a way the world is condemned and production is adequate. Interestingly, a scene presents Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Medal band; The writer Frank Ray Perilli and the assistant of Charles Band Bennah Burton. Despite his complacent nature, I really wanted to see how everything worked and, therefore, I liked it a lot.
