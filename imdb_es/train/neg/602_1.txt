Another example of the total loss of money from the UK Lottery. How commercial did this movie show? The Film Council, which financed this miserable garbage, must be stranded, in one of the disused stations of London Undergrounds, for allowing this clich√©, a frightening specimen to be dedicated to filming, a half-mutant thing composed of all the films of terror that the director has seen. and I felt in a position to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins is the rather obvious failure to make the main character sympathetic until the last minute. It's a bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, in the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the stage of the script. Add to this the terrible performance and the laughable appearance of the creature and you will get an excellent example of how not to scare.
