This movie could have been very good, but it falls short. Special effects of cheese and so on. I could have overlooked if the story was not so bad. If there was more than one background story, it would have been better. The plot centers around an evil druid witch that is linked to this woman who has migraines. The film continues over and over again and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps moving forward heavily. Christopher Walken has a part, but it does not make any sense, as is most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it seems that it is really badly made for the television movie. I would avoid this movie.
