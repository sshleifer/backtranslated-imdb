Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a lot of actors of fine characters, can save this ill-written attempt at wartime comedy, since his patented time has little to work on. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the start of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court the daughter of a Colonel (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, played by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in several adventures related to training exercises, filmed in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount generously budgeted for this effort, employing some of its best specialists, but the direction of the generally reliable David Butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a comic element missing from the stage. A change towards the end of the film to create an opportunity for Bolton's heroism is born with the bad work of specialists and the action of the camera as evidence. Interestingly, Lynne Overman is given the best phrases and this veteran teacher of the mockery manages very well. Dorothy Lamour looks charming and acts very well too, and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb, like his father, whose voice is unique on the screen or on the radio, but there is little they can do to save this film , damn as it is with an error in the script assignment.
