Special effects? All right. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. There is no plot. There is no depth. No meaning. This movie made Superman a hero without a sense, a hero without an archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, he represented nothing but the Hulk. <br /> <br /> Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that this movie did not have any depth. I can not see how anyone can get something meaningful from this movie, when Superman was, and is, created daily to be a significant hero not only in comics but also in people's minds. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this movie could have taken. <br /> <br /> Only a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on. and in. He was just another foolish incarnation of Hackman. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What was he standing for in this movie? Nothing more than another figure of "savior" hacked. <br /> <br /> Wait until you get to the dollar theater if you see it.
