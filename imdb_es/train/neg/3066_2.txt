This is a terrible remake of a marginal film, but much appreciated, from the early 70's. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie 'packed' in 2 hours or whatever the runtime. The story of Cheesy, which by the way, is completely different from the original. The greater participation of the government was implausible. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original, you could go for a beer or go to the bathroom and continue like this. <br /> <br /> It only took a few hours of film to change the oil pan in the car. It takes many times more time than that in real life. The boys in the car notice this. Besides, the fool or the fools who chose to destroy a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger must be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact that they are not "car people" is painfully obvious, and their demise will not be saddened. <br /> <br /> The actors lacked emotion, everything was cut and dry. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, the radio DJ said that the Challenger reached the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). That is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack of it? LOL !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
