You have to ask yourself how some flics are made ... this decided to jump with the why among many other things and simply deviates from the subject. <br /> <br /> And yet, there are a number of decent actors who do everything possible to instill some life into the story. The blue tint throughout the film is exceeded with 'again', which in itself would be depressing, but here is an exaggeration. The idea that it is not a medical condition, not a house or gypsy or a curse of trinket, but something that, for no apparent reason, begins to happen to our protagonist and then to all those around him, simply It ends up being like taking a big drink. of an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have superpowers but others do not know or do not know they have them. It seems that they are as clueless as we are. <br /> <br /> It's a scam of a poor man from "Invasion of the Body-Snatchers" with the "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense" by Keifer Sutherland. You all three seriously.
