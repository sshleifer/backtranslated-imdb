I totally agree with the other comment. Someone should make a Lily tiger. With this movie. <br /> <br /> It has to be one of the worst French movies I've seen in a long time (actually, along with Brotherwood). of the Wolves, 2 horrendous movies in a too short period of time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is pretty funny. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort among my beloved ones, I was very disappointed to see them engaged in such a poor film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is pretty bad, as usual, which shows he's a pretty face. and famous parents can get involved in movies, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> avoid this movie, if you want to laugh, watch a Alain Chabat or some fun-filled piece from the era like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
