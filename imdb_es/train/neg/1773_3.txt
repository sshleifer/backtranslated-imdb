Oh my gosh. Rarely did a "horror" movie bore me, or make me laugh, as much as this one. After an energetic start with an intriguing premise, it descends into not much more than a slasher movie, with some supernatural and sexual aspects. The usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted on this one, and the twists of the plot are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you're really desperate. Score: 3/10.
