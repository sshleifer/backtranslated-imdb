I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I did not care about his delivery. He just came out as an asshole in a defamatory and badly edited youth discrediting campaign. The editing cuts in abundance, etc. The camera would focus on it, and I would see 2 or 3 editing cuts in the course of a minute or two of dialogue. Add the constant boom microphones into the camera jack, which is a no-no movie. <br /> <br /> This documentary deals with a subject with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the film is so easy to make. Choosing religious fanatics is like messing with the retarded child. It's so easy that it's wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look like wallet bags? To make them contradict themselves, just let them recite more than one or two verses. I like it when he jumped back among people of the same religion and showed that they contradicted themselves completely. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist who talked about brain activity never materialized. It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious attacks compared to drugs or sex, or? I could have played more with women who rejoiced in Passion's play that was more like a rap scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have entered into the story of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had a colorful past. Deepen science v.s. religion. One is a very methodical and very strict process to increase confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid base upwards, a new layer on a more tested layer. A huge burden of proof is required every step of the way. The other begins at the top and is presented with irrepressible claims. It's like that, because well? I said. <br /> <br /> Done well? I would say make it into an original HBO series? hit a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It was a revelation about one thing. I must have been blind. Well ole G.W.Bush ... it's no wonder he was chosen. He had a religious majority. And well ... now it is the blind leading the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer ... Well ... what can I expect from a guy who delivers himself in Sutra on Newport Beach?
