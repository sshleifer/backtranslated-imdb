The 3-D that appears in "The man who was not there" means DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy presents terrible three-dimensional effects that make the three-dimensional effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" look better in comparison. Not to mention that the movie is stupid to the extreme. This was one of the many films of 1983 to present the emerging effects of the screen. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were caught in this mess, but at least they did not kill their careers. Tambor would continue to star in HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" box office, while Guttenberg followed this failure with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon." What they in those projects instead of them here in "The man who was not there." If you do it, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
