The package implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are getting a big bank robbery, but that's not what I got! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character (no introduction) in each other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long and annoying chase scene in low light. There's always an irritating sound in the background, whether it's a ticking clock, a siren blaring, a whistle on the train, or even the horrible score of Quincy Jones. There are also many parts that are ridiculously bad. Like, the bad guys who chase Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or, the police arrive at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
