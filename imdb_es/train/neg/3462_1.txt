The slash movies are few and far between, since a few days ago, so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard good things. Those good things that I heard were wrong ... very bad! This movie is bad and I mean MALO. It is simply stupid. All about it. Especially the origin of the murderer and how he stays alive and how he cares in the end. There is nothing original or exceptional in this movie. Just another aspiring slasher with those "Hip", "Self-conscious". Characters of "connoisseurs of the movie". I'm so sick of that shit. Someone does something different because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
