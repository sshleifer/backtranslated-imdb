Jesus Christ, I can not believe I've wasted my time watching this movie. I just watched because I'm very much in love with Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost takes away my grief. This is absolutely horrible! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 for this. <br /> <br /> The leader of this was very insipid and generic. I would love for the great Tiger Mistuharu Misawa to handle his butt through a glass window. It infuriated me every time I said "lake" and "cabin". I'd kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she could not even keep this complete joke of a movie. Unfortunately, I could not even act like I was crazy when I took that drug really. It seemed hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also loved the part where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time when ... it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at this movie because it's horrible.
