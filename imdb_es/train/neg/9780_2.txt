Good sir, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other critic must not have seen this movie, he must be seeing something else, or he has never seen a movie before ... 9 out of ten stars? Are you saying what, this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Unintentionally, incredibly funny characters, incredibly absurd situations, it seems that it was filmed in Griffith Park (which works quite well - MASH was shot in Griffith Park), shit script, almost everything that could be wrong with a movie shot in a package Visualization should be required for all possible filmmakers as an example of how a movie could be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something that a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give this a pass unless you use drugs and are in high camp.
