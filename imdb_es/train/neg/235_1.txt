The excellent cast can not raise this routine story of a secretary murdered by her married lover. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since we only have the side of the prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is the kind of rate that attracts the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs of America. As it is presented, it is the story of an innocent woman who has just been "caught" in an affair with a high-profile, married lawyer. Is it possible that IF, she had not been with her boyfriend twice and having an affair with a married man, all the nasty murderous and sordid incident could have been avoided? When you see this, do not worry about going to the fridge, you will not miss anything.
