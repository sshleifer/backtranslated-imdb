I can only assume that the other critics of this "film" are shareholders of the production company, since it was possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the first shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill to be considered "B-Level". Both my wife and I were in a good mood before starting this movie, and we were eager to see a fun popcorn movie. We knew we had not rented Citizen Kane, and we did not expect to see the most incredible movie in history. However, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painful and ungraceful garbage I have ever seen, we turned it off instead of losing other minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If it's a "comedy" without laughter, Terrible acting, slender plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better, at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this image because I have already lost almost an hour trying to find a joke.
