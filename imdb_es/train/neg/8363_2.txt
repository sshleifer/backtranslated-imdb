I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having to clean your teeth with a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic Certainly no action (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We do not ask about anything. We do not know how the people arrived where they arrived. It's always surprising to me how things like this are released. I agree with the previous writer that it is not even funny. I know. It lasts approximately 90 minutes and that will fill almost all the space in a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought in a sale of hungry artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
