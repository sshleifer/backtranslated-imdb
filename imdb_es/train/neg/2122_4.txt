Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative styles, Gabriele Muccino's project is quite mediocre. The film becomes increasingly silly and manipulative as it moves towards the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is more an amateur imitation of Amores Perros by Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 grams, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is that the story is quite predictable from VERY easily through the movie. That's very bad, because Seven Pounds could have been so authentically "good" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.
