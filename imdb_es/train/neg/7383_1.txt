I feel blessed to have what is known as Steven Seagal's worst film ever made. I knew I was in something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the movie, my eyes started to hurt and I almost fell out of my chair with an uncontrollable laugh. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with a constantly changing voice) and is totally amazing in his role (as always). Who the hell allows people with horsetail mullets with bad diapers to enter the Forces anyway? He also always writes himself in totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years younger than him. All support actors seem to have been filmed in the dark. By the way, did you film this movie in the dark with just a flashlight to illuminate? <br /> <br /> This is truly abominable in every possible way. Invite all your friends and make a social event, this is really special.
