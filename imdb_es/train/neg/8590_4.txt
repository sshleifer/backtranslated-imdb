Ridiculous. Annakin, 9 years old and angelic, becomes Annakin, 19, who is attracted to her son, who somehow looks attractive to Amidala, 5 years older than him. Now, the 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero, Annakin, has a couple of nightmares, and that is why he sacrifices the children, his friends and the whole framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him that his precious wife I could really die. and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think that people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are incredible (literally, not the perverted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor of the whole series, but in the climax, he cuts Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and lets him suffer. Does not anyone think it's a little out of place? Not to mention that it was stupid enough to risk living with him, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I expected at least one story that showed characters consistent with plausible motivations. None of that here. The story could have been written by a 10-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is pretty good.
