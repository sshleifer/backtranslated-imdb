It's not funny: how can someone link this with Monty Python? That's absolutely ridiculous, there's no laughing. This is not funny. Above, but ugly, weird just for the sake of the weirdos and it seems to me that these people were in something all the time. Unfortunately, something that did not make them funny. <br /> <br /> You must give some points for effort, etc. Actually, there seems to be a hint of laughter, or is there one? Hmmm ... Since there are almost no laughs, that's a questionable question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm committing an injustice, maybe it's some kind of exercise. Some kind of art: in that case, anything goes, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with sharp voices and arrogant noses. Come on !!! It's not fun <br /> <br /> There is only one apparent heir to the intellectual ingenuity of Monty Pythons and that is Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
