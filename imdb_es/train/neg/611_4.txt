Agree, "enjoy" is a fairly relative term, but flexibility is in order when it comes to a filmmaker of the caliber of James Glickenhaus. <br /> <br /> McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous. Action movies I've seen, without the unpleasant edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief with respect to the heroic middle-aged commanders of the film, but what about making a film in the Philippines that takes place in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact, the only character that is seen in a Hispanic way is good, Victor Argo, as the vile "El Presidente"! Oh yes, we also have Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso overestimated as a crazy rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing hymn to the glories of US imperialism.
