There are laughs in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and used to be funny (before deciding he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this movie, is how unpleasant are practically all the characters. Apart from the two main tracks, everyone is a jerk. I mean, these little losers in the city are as rude as you can get. Just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. On the other hand, the worker of the American factory presents himself as a lazy and ungrateful bum. It made me wonder if this movie was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, of course, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
