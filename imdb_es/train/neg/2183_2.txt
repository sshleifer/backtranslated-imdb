This movie was really bad, whether you take it as a science fiction movie, as a horror movie or even as a comedy. Everything is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea what the performance is and the script clearly shows that it was made along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster was added to the closet because the living head was not scary at all, it was even pretty, and they thought they needed something more impressive; They also failed here (the makeup is horrible even for the late 50's, quite fun). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer never materialized; He was very bad in both. The same goes for the actors, leading and supporting. <br /> <br /> The best achievement of "The brain that would not die" is its short execution time.
