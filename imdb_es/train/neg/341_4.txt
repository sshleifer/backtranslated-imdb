Oh man If you want to give your Crow T. Internal Robot a real exercise, this is the movie that will appear in the VCR ol '. The potential of cutting lines in this movie is infinite. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers below, hey, do you mind if a movie of this quality is "damaged?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for her when a child falls in love sexually with the father of the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for her of the same sex, and I do not think there is a term for that. It may be because his mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose sober bite, her neoliberal sexuality and her seductive figure make me forgive any amount of bad movies or unfriendly characters. Here Dana not only has no idea of ​​her daughter's behavior; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic competition of the Indulgent Mother. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana will miss Traci's killing streak because, to tell the truth, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It's only because the script dictates that she manages to perform any type of body count. <br /> <br /> A particularly hilarious note in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid whom Dana describes as a long time ago who is like one of the families, although she dresses with what the director thought I would say: "I fell off the tomato truck in Guadalajara". Carmen is so wise to Traci's machination that she can also use a sign that says, "Hi, I'm the next victim!" Indeed, Traci confronts Carmen when Carmen is coming back from the mass and hits her with one of those slightly angled studded keys that car manufacturers put beside her spare as a joke. Rather I suspect that in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette takes a flimsy dress to a vineyard, under a cloudy sky, talking to the owner. Cut to her with another flimsy dress under a sunny sky, talking to the owner's brother. Then cut to it using the first dress, in the first location, under the cloudy sky, but it is supposed to be later. You get the picture. We are talking about a bad address. <br /> <br /> As for the skin, do not expect much, although Traci has a pair of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for a litter, 8. For any other person, 1/2.
