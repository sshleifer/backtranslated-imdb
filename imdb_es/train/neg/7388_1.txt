drss1942 really took the words directly from my mouth. I loved the first Segal films and I feel like the only one who is still faithful to him. I just watched this movie (okay, I fell asleep around 90%, so I did not see the ending). When I woke up and saw that it was on the DVD menu, I felt grateful that I had not submitted to more of that movie and I did not dare to find out what happened in the end. There was something strange in the voice of Segal and others. Something reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice was doubled, but in the same language (Australian is English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, everyone would point now to this injustice of Segal.
