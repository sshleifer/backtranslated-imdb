Sheesh! What a terrible movie. An unreliable camera work, a script with more corn than Kellogg's, and acting in such a way that he could open a pig farm with him. <br /> <br /> To top it off, you do not know which audience to aim for, we have Cornel Wilde, or is it Corny Wilde? - get into your soap box about the dangers of smoking every time someone lights a cigarette, dear oh dear, and in another uncomfortable scene we have the evil one, Wolf, forcing him to, if you prefer, 'male friend' make a Striptease dressed in a bikini Try to explain one to the children ... <br /> <br /> Launch an excessively contrived Treasure Island-cum-Jaws story, and the result is such an unintentionally funny movie that it's nice. I should not wait. A special edition DVD anytime soon, however.
