I knew that this movie was supposed to be so bad that it was fun, so I came in with that expectation. It just seemed so bad to me that it was tremendously boring. The subject of whining is fun for about 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing smart, except its intentionally irritating quality. Seeing things sprinkled with tomatoes ages in about 30 seconds. There is simply nothing smart or funny in the movie, except the premise. Maybe I could hold a comedy sketch for 3 to 4 minutes, but this is simply not a feature film of any kind.
