I've only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and I really do not remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for photos because she made people happy. <br /> <br /> She really did not think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos he took were certainly tame by today's standards, and it's funny to see men with excited cameras, and politicians pontificating about the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played an excellent role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an excellent biopic of the most famous pinup girl in history.
