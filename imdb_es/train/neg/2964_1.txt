He laughed a lot, because it's incredibly bad, I'm sorry, but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen ... I know it's low budget, but anyway: the actors behave as if they were playing a soap opera, dialogues are absolutely horrible and the last time I've seen such strange images was in a junk nest in a youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people get together and film cheap films, but at least a certain quality must be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film were quiet, interesting and they looked good, and it was really worth listening to the score. The cover of the DVD promised a lot, but that's by far the best that this movie has to offer ...
