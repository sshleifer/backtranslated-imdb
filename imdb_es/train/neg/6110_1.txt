Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying one thing or another. She traces it (how?) And he tells the stories of the natives of a giant monster whose nightly howl can be heard throughout the jungle. It turns out to be the same Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue in the movie), who rescues her from the bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them alone in these dying two hours to romp naked while Hot Monkey watches and encourages . Normally I am very open to different opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unbearable," which is the best summary of a word I can think of. The Maltin Film Guide comments that they almost had to think of a rating lower than the PUMP.)
