Because it is, that's why! This is the same movie of jealous people who kill their daughter we've seen a billion times. Rosanna Arquette does anything worth seeing, and Mandy Schaffer's short nude scene (after joking in a garment with little clothing throughout the movie) in the end almost makes it worthwhile this trite blarney, but not altogether. <br /> <br /> * of * ***
