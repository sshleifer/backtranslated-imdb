Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent too much time creating the atmosphere of Hovis and laughing at Catholic demands. Then, very quickly, the fascists and socialists compete for the family's attention and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> Still, my wife thought Liam was cute.
