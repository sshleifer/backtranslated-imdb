This movie was o.k. But it could have been much better. There are some spooky moments, but there are not enough to make me want to see this movie again. There are some scenes in which you can move fast and not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, and that is the reason why I rate it so low. It is observable but do not expect anything great.
