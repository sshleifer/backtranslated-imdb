Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-intentioned but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) who tries to connect his scientific niece (Ryan) with the common kid Tim Robbins to relax and enjoy life over the years fifty. To make Ryan like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is nice, but the film fails with cheesy situations and ridiculous dialogues. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the excellent support team do everything possible to keep this stupid comedy afloat, but they can not rescue the film. It is unfortunate that so much talent has been produced to produce such a lackluster film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are great admirers of Meg Ryan.
