It's amazing that a script like clich√© and completely absurd can make any screen, even the small one. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmonica of the bad ass, the master of martial arts, impersonator of Elvis, gunslinger, who bets on the life of a former football player who became addicted to the game and played by the winner of the craptastic program of the NBC "Next Action Star". His performance is as cold as ice and not cold. The "movie" takes place in Las Vegas, and since people play poker there, the writers considered it the perfect setting for a movie about a man trying to survive 24 hours against a rich and omnipresent player who has offered his Target $ 2.4 million if you can. Do it through the day And so the hunt begins. A hunting that stinks with unimpressive explosions, configurations in the construction yard, bad quality cinematography and one line phrases that contain the word "bet" or "bet". The winner is also thrown into the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry, fans of "NAS" losers also make their memorable cameos. The surprise ending will surprise you if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reevaluate his decision to sell even more. I wish I could return those two hours of my life.
