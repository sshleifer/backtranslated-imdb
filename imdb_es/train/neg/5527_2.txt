The revolt of the zombies is bad. There's nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is boring, lifeless, badly performed and poorly written. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my liking, well, this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster. The run time of 65 minutes seemed 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: an expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". A man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens, free the zombies that are under their control and give horrible consequences. That's. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male protagonist. It seemed so familiar. I had a lot of time to think about this. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the "zombies rebelled", he hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had recently seen him as the General at White Christmas. That's how I "entertained" myself during most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of cinema compared to this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse).
