Normally, I would never rent a movie like this, because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I discovered that the videostorist gave me the wrong tape. In the box for Wes Craven's Nightmare, I found this film boring. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot does not make any sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the movie was really about. At the end of the movie, you have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> On the scale of 1 to 10 by Max Power, I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS: I would like to correct the Corinthian review (right below mine). He says that Robert Englund is tearing off the lingerie, riding a bare horse, etc. The guy who did those things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
