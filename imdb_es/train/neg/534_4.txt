This shit is like looking at the paint in its tracks. I am very disappointed because I was so anxious to see her. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not make sense. If it was never done, nobody would notice or care. It is promoted because of all the big names in it, but if "nobody" was inside, nobody would give any love to this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the point where I was in the middle of the movie. I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry up and die now!" This is like the "Club of luck", without any joy. It's "Ocean's 13" (nothing more than a cast of big names) from films of mothers and daughters and completely anti-climatic ... oh, until it's finally over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone will be nominated for the Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for the cinematography and the ability to convince the great actresses to commit themselves to this trash.
