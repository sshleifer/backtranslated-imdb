Jude Law gives it all in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little more value. It completely lacks eroticism, emotion or prominent women with appeal. A decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a plot of a note. <br /> <br /> The film is philiphed in a series of conversations between the character of Law and a stubborn homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are posted on the cross of the banality of the film. <br /> <br /> With a minor actor in the lead role, and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis cinematography, crocodiles would mix with The Sea of ​​Low Budget Vampires.
