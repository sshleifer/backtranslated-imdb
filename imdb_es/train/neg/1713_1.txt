If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you have not. A contest like "make your own horror movie in a day" could not have an entry that this insult an insult to the intelligence of any viewer. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, an argument, an appropriate dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and the accredited lighting designer obviously forgot to appear. It seems that it was recorded in the crudest of the handheld cameras and copied into an even worse computer. The make-up effect consists of black mascara for the zombies and yogurt that is poured over people's heads to simulate the fusion of the skin. This is just a home movie, and also very bad. It was just fun to watch friends, family and neighbors who were willing to attend the filming. For my life, I can not understand why this mockery of a product appears in ANY magazine or serious movie website. I have homemade wedding movies that are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is more of the same garbage.
