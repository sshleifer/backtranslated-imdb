Seeing this movie? I thought to myself, that a lot of garbage. These girls must have stones for the brain, even to accept being part of it. A waste of time seeing it, weak skies, I only hired it. The performance was below standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone who is contemplating watching this movie, please save your money. The movie has no credit at all. I am a true movie buff and this is worse than "The attack of green tomatoes". <br /> <br /> I just hope that this garbage has not cost too much. The money would have been spent better on the homeless in the world. I just hope there is not a sequel in the pipeline.
