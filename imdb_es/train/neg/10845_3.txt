Surprisingly I had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less argument (I do not want to mention Asian movies but ...). I thought the camera was not bad for a cheap movie like this, and also that the atmosphere was not so bad. There is no real reason for most things that people do and how they react to what happens. Although I think about many movies, in this case it was horrible, of course. <br /> <br /> He ripped some movies so bad just for individual scenes. The performance was bad but I've seen it worse. The movie was bad but I've seen it worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, fits of laughter, death wish, sadism, cornea and entertainment at a low level. <br /> <br /> So if you like bloody movies with stupid plots, this is the right movie for you. . <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it CAN be entertaining if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in a good mood.
