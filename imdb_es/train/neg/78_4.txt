The annoying mouse and the lullaby really affected me and they really had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I would have done my first year in film school. Very sad. Also, the story seemed to crawl for no apparent reason ... there were too many things that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team did not really know what they were. doing, or simply that it should have been shorter ... what would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just seen all the episodes so far this past week ... I must say that this was the worst, and I wanted to warn others not to start with this one.
