I had so many hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like Arabian Nights. On the other hand, I was disappointed by a film that did not catch my attention from the beginning, although I tried to see it twice! <br /> <br /> It was an advantage that Caradine was in this movie, but it was not much, since the actors lacked sympathy. For something a little similar, Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for the action, the comic moments and the fun in general. <br /> <br /> Well, then Son of the Dragon has a lot of potential fans, but if you're looking for something that you have to wonder about in terms of martial arts and plot you will not get it. If you just want the children to calm down on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe this is for you along with the 3 ninjas.
