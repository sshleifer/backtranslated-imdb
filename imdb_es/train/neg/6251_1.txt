I was able to stay alone for the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie. The most obvious absurdity was that, while US prisoners in a prisoner of war camp in North Korea allegedly suffer severe deprivation of food and medicine, they go without bathing, shudder in fragile and dirty parkas, and sleep in flats discovered, and let's not forget Lasting torture: they always manage to show impeccably combed hair. With the exception of a Harry Morgan looking suitably austere as an army commander, the casting and acting are simply awful. It seems that Ronald Regan can not stick to portraying a single character and, instead, creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying officers from the North Korean camp could have been forgivable, but when Russian officials allegedly acted as advisors to the Koreans they were strutting around wearing Nazi uniforms with full burrs with jodhpurs and booty boots (obviously recycle the Costume department of World War II movies) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six kinds of fools. Do not waste your time on this.
