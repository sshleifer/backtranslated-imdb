A saga of "misfits in the army", which half treats of being surreal (the strange subtitles) and vulgar (gags of flatulence), but ends up being a mixture of many different types of humor, none of them followed with much success. Barbara Bach, the Bond girl in "The Spy Who Loved Me," has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
