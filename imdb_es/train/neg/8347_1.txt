The title should have been "The Walker". That was just what he did on foot. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good in the movie. The description of the movie does not really meet the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a terrible person with a low life. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I was waiting for it to be better ... than error. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is one suggestion I can make for the producer to be re-directing his life to another field, because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea.
