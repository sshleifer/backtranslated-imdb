This could have been interesting? A story of a haunted house set in Japan from the point of view of a newly installed American family? but it is deflated due to an excessively simplified treatment and the inadequacy of both the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> The film has the same problem that I often encounter with the modern popular revival of this kind of native food, that is, the fact that spirits prove to be bad for no real reason other than that you expect them! Also, do not you give a lot in the fear department? Is a giant crab attack simply dumb? as, in general, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause it to act in a totally unusual way, such as Susan George, the diplomat / friend of the family who seduces Doug McClure and Edward Albert, forcibly feeding his daughter with a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At some point, does an old monk appear in the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there? Eventually, he is called to exorcise the premises. However, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only result of the tense situation duly created. leading to a violent but involuntarily funny climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu duel of karate to the death. At the end of the day, this arises as a harmless waste of time. tolerable in only 88 minutes but, by no means, essential visualization.
