Quote: theurgist: Anyone with an I.Q. More than 50 would have seen this movie, an intelligent and well-acted prequel to a modern-day classic, yes, it does not have a successful cast or a big budget BUT it's still very well done and it hooked me throughout the duration. <br /> <br /> An IQ more than 50 say ... what you most want to say is that you have an I.Q. less than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Ascend to power !!! which means that I should have something with the first thing to do ... <br /> <br /> everything and everyone is a good movie if ... CHANGE THE TITLE AND THERE ARE NO CHARACTERS NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps do not comment on a movie if you do not know anything about movies. but I guess an I.Q. less than 50 years, you will not know what the hell I'm screaming about ... <br /> <br /> Peace be out!
