This film is an abomination, and its realization should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of film making is the reason why no one has made a faithful adaptation of this wonderful mystery to the film. It is a tale of a really exciting mystery, a good romance in the old way and a dry English humor. Why the creators had to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective, present the idiotic role and the caricature of his English servant, change the main story about the murder charge and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the accused? , etcetera etcetera.? These producers and directors who always think they can create a better story than the book should write the original script and not violate someone else's product.
