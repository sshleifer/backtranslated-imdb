Once I used the name Wesley Snipes as a clue to go ahead and watch a new movie, without trying, in which it appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes movie recommendation method has failed. Absolutely. First I should have come here to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow their otherwise fervent efforts to be wasted on "The Contractor". <br /> <br /> One of my worst movie fears has come to a bitter fruition. I feared that the trembling, fuzzy, pseudo-documentary style of direction and editing, "not considered" (which caught my attention the "Bloody Sunday" directed by Paul Greengrass) could spread to other films. The sickly style of Greengass was taken to nauseating levels in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear had come to pass. In my opinion, these films are very badly made by these methods that induce the disease of movement, which confuse blurred strokes with "improvement of action". But the "Bourne Franchise", as Greengrass, so affectionate, calls her dairy cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood not to be professionals in the pursuit of fast and big money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, Hollywood types. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, not simply hinted at by lazy and deficient cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" even goes so far as to emulate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in insanely repeated sound fragments, hoping that their (apparently evaluated) youth audiences can not feel them. For example, if I listen to a police radio "Yankee-Romeo" once again, I will just scream. There are many possibilities that I will not hear it again: I will certainly never see "The Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to those of you who have not yet seen "The Contractor": just happy with the peace of mind that this lack brings to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10; I'm tempted to lower that to 1.
