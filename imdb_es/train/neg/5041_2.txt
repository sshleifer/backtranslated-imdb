Ye Lou's Purple Butterfly film confronts a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in the Shanghai war. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) are on opposite sides of the conflict after a casual meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the critic of Paris. The film replaces a complicated semi-historical conflict with a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to worry about the characters or their causes. The sudden change of time does not help, since it seems completely unjustified and meaningless. Normally I do not care about dark films, but the absence of light, the camera images that shake the bones and the bad film making techniques make it a difficult movie to watch and one that interests me. I also agree with the viewer From Georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography", but I do not think that helps the film. The backdrop of the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not think you can do it justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. Excessively melodramatic moments do not increase your observation capacity. <br /> <br /> All the actors are suitably melancholic. Zhang Ziyi, once again, proves that he has an exceptionally limited range of performance, as he spends the entire film doing what he seems to do best in all his films, meditating and looking generally annoying. However, at least, add some variety to this role by chain smoking and participate in the worst lovemaking scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> In general, a very disappointing movie, especially watching the director of Suzhou come. 2/10
