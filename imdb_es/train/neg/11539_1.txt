This is the biggest load of garbage I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was while watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no point in this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every phrase of the dialogue that has to use the word "F" to minus one A couple of times on it. It has an extremely cheap performance and is very low budget. My friend and I finally turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this harshness. DO NOT LOOK AT IT!
