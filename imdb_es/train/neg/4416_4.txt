A less than subtle touch of the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church receives a darker tone of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor plays a medium through which various commonly heard rhetorical questions are asked, especially "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (although some might disagree) of her stereotyped religious teacher who talks to the "company line" and condemns half of the world to burn in hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of your school, invite your first students to return and hold their Christmas contest. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updates" its game to parody Sister Mary's "fallacious" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiraling through an unhappy chain of events . The end finally leaves the audience with a feeling of illness in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go see the game instead.
