Put the blame on executive producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this big-budget debacle: an update of "Dracula", with a condescending verbal blow to Bram Stoker (who probably would not want his name on this)) and nothing else for the Rest of us, except shakes of slasher and gore style. Christopher Plummer seems winding like Van Helsing in modern times, not just a descendant of Van Helsing but reality; it is maintained with the leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, which is exhaled from his coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and transferred to New Orleans. This is just what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced but without a single original idea (except for multiracial victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat itself. * since ****
