Oh man is this bad movie. It flows horribly. The story is about a racing driver who is in love with himself, and then he has to promote a chain of fast-food chickens and, in doing so, he does not love himself. Try to get out of the contract and horrible and painfully unpleasant gags happen. Jim Nabors seems as if he's walking asleep, not acting. You'll miss Burt's teammates like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while you watch this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is downright scary, which shows that tons of hairspray did not come out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of which, Burt's wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie, ever, up there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, fortunately, did not have a sequel) are fantastic and fun movies. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, sucks. You will crave a Jackie Gleason villain that is fun to hate. And yes, this is not one of those fun movies to take. It is lousy, pure and simple. Even the shots in the end were boring and boring, and worst of all, without grace. And I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before its revival years later in "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" years before, shows that man can act. Pretty good when you have a decent platform to do it.
