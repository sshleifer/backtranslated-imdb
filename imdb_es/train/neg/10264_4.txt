The head of a common family in New York, Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) in "Smyrner's Candy Store". After the traffickers kidnap Ms. Grandin in the purchase and sale of women as prostituted prostitutes, Ms. Gail and her police boyfriend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the young woman with a threat of virtue. <br /> <br /> "Traffic in souls" has a reputation that is difficult to maintain; It is not very well done, and it does not show anything very special in having the "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex merchants. Maybe, it can be backed up like a movie that deals with the subject in a longer length than usual (originally it was said to be ten reels). The location scenes of New York City are the main attraction, after all these years. The shooting of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems capable of making the cameras move. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
