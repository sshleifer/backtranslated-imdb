Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and a poor address. This is the case of "The tomb of the mummy." <br /> <br /> The script contains leftover ideas from old and better horror films such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The address is hackneyed and rancid. The acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand," and the producers are foolish enough to add much better prequel images of Christy Cabanne and point out the weakness of his own movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this movie was and, essentially, he remade it from scratch two years later as "The Ghost of the Mummy" with a much better script and a better director. The result was probably the best film in his "Mummy" cycle of four films, although it is not as good as Karl Freund's 1932 original. <br /> <br /> The images of Cabanne elevate this film to a 3. The "new" material is a 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their characters fired so they would not have to appear in dreck like that!
