He only gets the third turnover (behind Arthur Treacher and Virginia Field), but this was effectively David Niven's first lead role and he's charmingly silly like head butt Bertie Wooster of GG Wodehouse, master (name only) of Jeeves, the most Unfit for valet parking. As an adaptation, it is more like a THE 39 STEPS diluted than a true Wodehousian excursion. And that is very bad since the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not far from the brand. Unfortunately, the movie "B", the tropes and the forced comedy becomes exhausting even in just 57 minutes. The follow-up of the following year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more out of place, without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forced to play the goof.
