This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a long, long time. If you knew how often I went to the cinema, you would probably say it, it's hard to imagine, but anyway, it's true! After watching the trailer of this movie, I knew I had to see it. If you are a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why would not you? The trailer is nothing short of intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these. <br /> <br /> From cinematography to script and acting, this film is a complete failure. If you are reading this, you plan to go to the movie expecting emotions, mystery, action, horror or anything else that is not a waste of one hour and forty-five minutes. I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. <Br /> <br /> "Why is it so bad?", You might ask. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor full of suspense. Nothing about the movie made me in the least "on the edge", scared or curious. The script was, at best, ridiculous. There were numerous occasions throughout the film in which the dialogue was so ridiculous that I started writing it as a comic relief, only to discover a few seconds later that it was not. The performance was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but this was a mistake. Without exception, all the performances in this movie were incredibly below average. The cinematography was horrible, without a single moment of suspense or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie a mile away. <br /> <br /> Generally I am not a very hard critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy, I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, badly performed, badly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
