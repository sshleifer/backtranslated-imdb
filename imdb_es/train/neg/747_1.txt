Finally, I thought someone was going to do justice to H.G.'s classic. Wells, not another version in the wrong place or time, but one based firmly in the book. Well, definitely follow the book very closely, and that is the only advantage of this mess. <br /> <br /> This lasts 180 minutes (yes, 3 hours), the book has only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I have never used a video camera or been in any type or school of theater in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid a good amount of money to get this shit in the UK from the USA. UU., Do not make the same mistake as me.
