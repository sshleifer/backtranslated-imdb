In Hollywood, in the 1930s and 1940s, I think that all studios can do a western, except Warner bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except, perhaps, because they die with their boots on, which is a Western cavalry). I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said it looks like a mushroom. Right! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too much of the twentieth century to be credible in a western movie. The story here had no surprise, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I imagine I can see Bogart and Cagney dropping their little guns and sticking their hands in a machine gun to get away from the stage in a 1930s black car.
