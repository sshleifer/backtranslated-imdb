When a lot of people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen", they tend to say that about practically any movie they did not like. However, of the almost 700 films that I remember seeing this one, it is one of the two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I registered in IMDb just for praising the evilness of this movie. I went to see him when he was in the theaters (I and my two friends were 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years I can not remember many details, but my attitude when leaving the theater is very clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh my, where to start. The fat loser who remains at the altar, goes the weekend of skiing, meets a blonde bomb who is interested in him, takes him home to join the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main dish, a pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kick everyone Cula and run away with the brother's girlfriend, live happily ever after. Threw up. First of all, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUN, and that this was a COMEDY. The special effects, the few that exist, seem to have been done 15 years before. The dramatic finale was so bad and bad acting that it was almost unbearable to see (hits the whole cannibal family with rakes on the lawn, which raise the style of Tom and Jerry when they step on them). I am sure there is much, much more, but I have no intention of seeing him again to refresh myself.
