As if the story was not depressing enough, this film shows how the cows are sacrificed graphically in a slaughterhouse for five minutes while the protagonist narrates her early life as a butcher. Weird things. Then there is the main premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts his cock because a man who loves work says that he would have gone with him if she were a girl. Is this person a psychopath, a masochist, just a condemned queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? He just was not adopted and had to live with nuns who at first loved him and then hated him because he was ungovernable. Try to explain the reasons why he did what he did, but it is really very difficult to empathize. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it supposed to be fun? What was it really about?
