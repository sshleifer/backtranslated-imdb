I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors were talking as you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to talk if he pretended to be a jaded, stone-hearted policeman or an ultra-evil villain. Scraped voices seemed amateur to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and get better opening music. And what about all the 1984 police torture things? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the real events of history. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be great, but it had nothing to do with the story. It is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges's stories so good is their minimalism: they are closely linked, without superfluous details. This movie is the opposite. I stopped looking after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the Yidische Zaitung guy, or out there. I lost $ 4 when renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction writing this review and, hopefully, prevent others from making the same mistake.
