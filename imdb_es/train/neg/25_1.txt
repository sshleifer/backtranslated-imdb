['Sometimes, a movie is so horrible that it has a destructive effect on your morale. You start to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so low? Can you honestly expect us to support so many clich√©s and stay entertained? <br /><br /> Of course, it is still a pillar of Hollywood to make the GUN the main character, the device of the plot and the source of all conflict and resolution in the movies. The character needs a weapon. Obtain a weapon I can not do that because he has a weapon. Put your gun first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do? You have a weapon! It agitates him, acting more maliciously than real human beings. He shoves it in someone&#39;s face for 90 minutes, screaming questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br /> It is a real challenge to make such a tired and trite formula work again; A film has to be very intelligent and well executed. This is none. It has no life or personality, and will absorb these components of YOU. It will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space you do. Really, who needs that? So yes, I&#39;ll say it: I think this could be the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen. Anyone who has been involved in making this mediocre garbage to kill souls should feel publicly ashamed of the bad service they have done to us all.']
