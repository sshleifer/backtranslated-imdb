Rex Reed once said of a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that it looked like it was filmed through pomegranate juice. I remembered that while snoring through Purple Butterfly. It looked like it had been fired through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it did not help that in much of the scenes the actors' faces were literally out of focus or only focused after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> In addition, they all looked the same, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. This is what I call the syndrome of the "Society of the Dead Poets." <br /> <br /> There was no one to worry about, nobody who was interested dramatically, and the film did not shed historical light on a very interesting period of time and a set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
