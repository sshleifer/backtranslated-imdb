David Mamet is a very interesting and incomparable director. His first film, "House of Games", was the one I liked most, and established a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they enter into complicated situations, and also the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This is 'Homicide' that, from the title, tries to put the mind of the viewer in the usual criminal drama. The main characters are two police officers, one Jewish and another Irish, who deal with an area with a racial charge. The murder of an old Jewish store owner who proves to be a former veteran of the Israeli war of independence unleashes Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> These are the flaws of the movie. They are the most obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way in which the detective finally walks up to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is intelligent like Mamet's, but disappointing from a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give good interpretations, but the shortcomings of the story are too obvious to compensate easily.
