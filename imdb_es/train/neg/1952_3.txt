Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That's the first, the most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to re-imagine Scooby-Doo and company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound like it has ever sounded in either of them. The previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They also changed the outfit and the classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they're up to, with the villain's angle, but it's certainly not following the formula used in any of Scooby's previous programs. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very strange and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo animation. But the strange animation used for other WB programs grew on me; this could, too. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out - once - if you can handle the lack of an appropriate Shaggy voice. That there is enough to get one to enjoy the show correctly. Also, I'm trying not to be an inflexible fanatic. It evolves or dies, as the saying goes. We will see how it looks after two more episodes, by then I will have formed a much stronger opinion.
