"I just watched this movie last night and I do not think I think the same of any of the actors involved, because this movie will stay in my mind." <br /> <br /> The above The statement can be considered as something good or bad. Every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A Few Good Men" which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown," which is a VERY bad thing. <br /> <br /> I took this thinking that it could be something intelligent or at least making me Laughing and with Arye Gross and the mentioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought that at least it would not be bad. You could say that the movie was made with a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. INCORRECT. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT fun or entertaining in any sense of any word. It's just there and lasts 84 unbearable minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin. You almost care about NONE of the characters, and since the protagonists are two Hollywood writers with a dream that are the two writers with a dream who wrote this need, you must know them. Okay, the two REAL writers know all about the onscreen versions of themselves, so they think the public too. They do not even think about the development of the character, except to try to link the story with "The Island of Gilligan." <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are also twenty other people living there. The rest of the story is artificial and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon's favorite deadly sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can not find a good story to make a television movie, so he creates one. Now replace the television writer with a screenwriter, transform Mantegna into annoying actors half his age, and remove the comedy and you will have this movie. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for about 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. She is still hot, but it would be helpful if she really STAR in a movie instead of constantly doing CAMEOS. As for all the others, I do not think it was the actors' fault because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Go see the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
