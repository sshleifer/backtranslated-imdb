What happened in the making of this film so that it ended up being the total disaster that it is? Just one year after "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire" (who, by the way, looked and acted in the latter as if they were still the misfits of the secondary school, but without the grasp or discipline to portray their roles. <br /> <br /> It was the address or the writing.Since it was the same person (Joel Schumacher), they must be both, but Schumacher has already given us "The Phantom of the Opera," "Phone Booth," "A Time to Kill," and two Batman movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever," which range from a good direction to a great direction. it went wrong in "StEF" because it has no genius, no comedy is worth anything, and is far from what really has value in life. <br /> <br /> Example: the character Wendy (a rich girl with a heart to do good and help those less fortunate played by Mare Winningham) reveals Billy (a vague ingobe He is a man who cheats on his wife and girlfriends, drinks too much and has no sense of order in his life properly interpreted by Rob Lowe) that she is still a virgin. Billy really sees a challenge and a possible conquest, but Wendy "is not ready". Wendy, in fact, is not so smart that it's hard to believe she's in this gang of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, whose wife has left him, took his son and married another, somehow he has put together some of the threads of his life. Billy goes to New York, abandoning and abandoning all parental responsibility for his little daughter, convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "farewell gift" for her. And Wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, does not seem to be eliminated by this despot. Give me a break. The only thing he can only give once, is he give it to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There are many more examples in which there is a complete disconnection between what is real and the value that is thrown overboard and acts resemble virtue. <br /> <br /> I suppose some may say that "that was in the 80s", but I remember it was in the "80s" when men began to take responsibility for the children they had, either in a marriage or outside . <br /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what is really valuable and correct. <br /> <br /> As for the technique (not the story), it was terrible as well. It is disconnected and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited at 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. Pick up what's on the floor of the editing room, put it back and the movie would probably flow much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have done it) or maybe he forgot about writing the St Elmo's Fire script or maybe this group of actors took over the whole and went their own way, that's what I really think happened.
