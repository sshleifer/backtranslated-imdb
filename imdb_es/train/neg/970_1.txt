Normally I'm not the type that scares with horror movies, but this movie is the exception. somehow this movie got in my mind !!! It is a very simple film, but at the same time extremely effective, it has a great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the father of the girls that comes downhill is a real highlight. Another view was the family photo, I did not expect that and I jumped out of my seat. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, with the lights off it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
