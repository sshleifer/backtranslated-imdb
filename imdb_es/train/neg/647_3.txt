The acting was horrible, as well as the script. It was badly done and made you almost want to laugh at the various scenes of murders terribly depicted. The end was even worse. Everyone was still dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly fine! They did not give enough history about the teacher's obsession, etc. The film needed more time to develop a better story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for the young actors. They needed better training. They really could have made this a good movie, but the script and the acting failed miserably.
