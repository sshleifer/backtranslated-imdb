First of all, I have no idea how this movie came to the big screen. It's not even the low-budget SCI-Fi movie, it's just horrible. Me and my friend that we love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. We went to see this movie, waiting for this movie for me, a Transformers with dragons, entertainment without meaning. All we got was an hour and a half without meaning. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so horrible along with the performance that it made up for it. It is basically a Chinese leg of dragons that return every 500 years ... Does it sound like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should, not only leaving gaps in the plot, but with magic, and a real very small war between dragons (rather large snakes) becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor to the film that failed. My friend and I laughed at the whole thing (along with all 5 of the audience), and we can not believe that we spend money on this. The short trailer on television makes up for most of the action, while garbage makes up for the rest. I have seen many B films like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want a non-stop laugh for an hour, look at this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but I would have helped before watching this movie
