This movie has to be one of the worst I've seen on DVD! The storyline could have clicked if the movie had more backgrounds and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sick scenes in which I warn parents ... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there were something like a disc through a filmmaker, it would have come from that. It reminded me of many of the quick films that were published in the 1960s, bad writing and script shooting. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the whole movie were the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the movie could easily have been done by high school kids. I give this movie a grade of 1, since it is really horrible and I left all my family with the feeling of being cheated. My advice: Do not look at it!
