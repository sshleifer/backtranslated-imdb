The tomb of the mummy begins with a review of the events in The Hand of the Mummy and then advances the story several years and crosses the ocean to the United States of America, where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and revenge those who violated the grave in the past. <br /> <br /> While I loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as the Imhotep mummy, and I quite liked "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this movie), It was so taken with "The tomb of the mummy". <br /> <br /> It is made in a style similar to that of the previous film and has a similar plot although in a new scenario. Lon Chaney Jr is fine as Kharis, but he really does not stand out. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie, that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but there is nothing really surprising either, so the viewer is left with a story about a rather bland mummy.
