This Hal Roach comedy short, A Tough Winter, is the ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Basically, a showcase for the black comic Stepin Fetchit that receives a special bill here, we see him going to his hut where the gang meets. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and Stepin tells him to read it since he can not read it during the day while going to school NIGHT. It turns out that it's from his girlfriend in Tennessee, so now Farina has to have ears full of cotton, since it's too hot for her to hear! In another room, Weezer transmits instructions to Mary Ann on how to make taffy from the radio, but because she keeps running to the kitchen, she misses the madness of the announcer with the arroz con leche and the Spanish tamale that confuses Mary Ann with the additions of Tabasco and Lux! Once the mix is ​​complete, Jackie and the rest of the gang are helped with the horrible taste but with a very sticky substance, as everyone is trapped on the walls as a result. While everyone tries to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement of several pipes and outlets that combine functions of variable appliances, such as a telephone with vacuum cleaners, a sounding vacuum cleaner and a refrigerator that plays music. The end. What I just described augurs the meandering nature of this short film from "Our Gang" that served as a pilot for a possible short series of the movie Stepin Fetchit. It is just as good that it has never taken place, since Fetchit's characterization of lazy black was fun only in small doses and today would be considered highly offensive. Many of the scenes I have just described are good for some laughter, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too blah for me. So in summary, A hard winter is a curiosity that is worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
