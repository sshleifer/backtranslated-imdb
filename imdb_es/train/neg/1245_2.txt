['Absolutely the worst movie of Burton, which seems to get worse with each film he directs. A miserable script loaded with clich√©s is only the first of many objectionable aspects of this film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you&#39;ll make sure you hear someone scream &quot;you&#39;ve lost your weapon!&quot; or whatever it is for everyone to know. Carter is really horrible and so is Wahlberg, who can not play correctly and be convincing. Very good effects and photography, but bad music in the mold of John Williams by the friend of Burton Elfman. Heston appears in a pointless scene to release his most famous quotes from the first movie. Very bad results. <br /><br /> If someone else saw &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, it is likely that they will have noticed, as I did, the decreasing quality of Burton&#39;s films. I have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was incorporated as a director, in which case his judgment should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slide; The evidence is there in the movies. In &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; I could not decide what kind of movie I was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British actors (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think it was some kind of movie of monsters&#39; rally (never scary, as fans of horror know). The film was not successful in horror or comedy because it was very schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to soften the two together. &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is very similar, and the result comes out more like &quot;Total Recall&quot; or &quot;Tango and Cash&quot; than science fiction. It has also fallen into the routine of so many other &quot;big&quot; directors trying to satisfy as many audiences as possible. Go to Burton, if he&#39;s out there, choose something and do it directly, or use a bit of style to put it all together (as in &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; or &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;) or he could retire, because people like it Those of you who are a fan of your movies will stop going.']
