I've seen enough of Little Richard in interviews and presentations, and enough of poor Leon typecast in these musical biographies of the 50/60 to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but fails to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> The actor Miguel Núñez, who played Little Richard in "Why do crazy people fall in love?" It was a much more appropriate option, having achieved the powerful but effeminate personality of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, then the film will be too. And this is what has happened here. Glossed or overlooked are the incursions of LR into homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well in capturing the group's boom, warts and all, this movie is completely lost. <br /> <br /> What is happening with the director Robert Townsend who started very well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He's a talented and funny guy, but he has not delivered anything close to that first effort.
