Well, I had to be generous and give this a 2. This was mainly due to the free holes cut in that lady's shirt where her breasts are. I thought it was fun. Apart from that, this movie does nothing but provide a good laugh with a friend. It's funny if you're willing to throw comments about "mysterious science theater" with someone, but it's no better than a 2. And a 2 is pretty bad.
