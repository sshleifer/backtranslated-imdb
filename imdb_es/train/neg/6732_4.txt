I discovered this movie at IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For "small" love stories, some of the stories really went on in this movie. The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses talked about their real sexual lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I must admit that I want to start seeing again some more romantic views of the first sexual encounters, as in "Strike! (1998)", when the acquaintances of Odette Sinclair began to ask him about his presumed first time, and Tweety asked: "Was it beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some might think that recreations and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think it would make things worse. It does not necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
