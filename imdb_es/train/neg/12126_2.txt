Here is another film by Diane Lane where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time it is set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the man in the blouse. I'm not so surprised because that's very predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws milk. I would not be surprised if she also slept with the milkman. I would not be surprised if she had also slept with the ice cream man because this is a very boring movie. Then, after throwing some milk, she regrets it and returns to see the man in the blouse. Duh Then, while she does it with him, her son is stung by the wasps. My mom always told me not to throw stones at a nest of wasps. This mom of the children did not have time to tell her that she was too busy with the man in the blouse.
