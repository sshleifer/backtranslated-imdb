The reasons to see how it comes out of this ... err ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It is on while your channel navigates and nothing else is on. - Someone pays you to see it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get the DVD for Se7en, download it, download it in iTunes or put it in your Netflix entry and skip The Flock completely. The Flock the same story with some changes. In addition, the edition only makes a dent in Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst is probably the helicopter flight of the desert, with sounds of people speaking on the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one. <br /> <br /> In a few words: I call it flagrant lowering. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute movie, go ahead, but go see Se7en.
