Is not anyone more tired of that old clich√© in which a person almost dead appears in a horror movie, gives us some information and then blows his head for no apparent reason? I know that I am. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that its use in this movie is worthless. If you have seen the first movie (the first new version I should say), then the information provided is completely useless, because you would have already known. I guess it might not be worth it for the main characters ... but then, why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Would not I want to live? Sure, he would have died anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is the second movie titled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first is the sequel to the original movie of the 70s. This is where it gets a bit complicated for someone like me. Look, I'm probably part of a minority of people my age who even knew there was an HHE2 to start with, let alone an original HHE1. And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is called exactly like the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it makes it worse! But anyway ... <br /> <br /> Hills Have Eyes Original Wes Craven was decent. In the end, however, the idea was better than the presentation, but probably had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not as good as a horror director. He just made some good horror movies (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good (Scream) and a lot of horrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh, yes, and did Swamp Thing, too ... but the original HHE2 falls into the latter category. I've only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has co-written the new HHE2 ... and it is a big disappointment! The new version of HHE last year was even better than the original movie. It was tense. I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a group of teenagers crazy about beer, marijuana and sex. It made us feel dirty. During the first hour we were in hell and finally, in the last moments, the good ones took revenge of the bad guys and it felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tension. Without any suspense. Only violent things happen to people who are mostly stupid. There is almost no threatening presence here. Only ugly hobos that hide under the rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm getting tired of horror movies where people die for the stupid mistakes they keep making. It was only the other day that I saw "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson kept walking around the water, while delivering the speech, and then a shark devoured him, just because the idiot stayed near the water. Something no one would do in the given situation! Here is exactly the same. People go alone to filter themselves even though they know that people are dying ... seriously, could not I wait for a bath? And then, when you think that people would have learned, another person goes alone! Seriously, is not it more scary when the characters bring their A game and still lose? I think so ... <br /> <br /> Even under deliveries. I should have made the first remake look like the remake of "The Fog" (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything. <br /> <br /> But really low. Less bad guys. No tension. Of course we have more time in the caves, but not much happens there. In the end, it just seems like there are two or three bad guys. The last movie made him look like a tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who keeps watching them through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things that this movie should have brought us, but it ends with the same promise that the last movie gave us, with the same scene of "being seen". Come on! I will give the devil his due. The look of the movie is good ... but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that Gore fans like this ... although I'm probably wrong! There is gore (although the majority accelerates while it is in the dark), but without the tension, and the characters that interest you ... the gore does not do anything in my book! In the end, you are not scared. You're not in shock (unless you're an 8-year-old girl). You do not even feel you've seen something new.
