After reading the book, I loved the story. When I saw the movie I was disappointed that so many changes have been made. It is understandable that books and films differed, but they were two different stories, only the names and part of the history of the book were left. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you worry about them. The locations were in accordance with the descriptions of the book. Some characters not included. Television has put so many great books and stories in the microwave, this is a perfect example of that. The author's comments do not always ensure a good movie, but sometimes they can help.
