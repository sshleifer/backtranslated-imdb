I admit to having been a fan of the original theatrical production. I never saw the film version until recently on the cable, and I saw it in advance, to see my memories come alive again, because I loved the original program. Imagine my consternation. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show to the movies that has ever been made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I was waiting for a trip on the path of memory, singing to the extraordinary play Music and the mirror, In the ballet and Hello to the twelve, Hello, thirteen. Do not! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they ruined the plot, adding songs and external arguments (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) that were not present in the original, and injecting "drama" where it was not necessary. The original had a lot of pathos for itself. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not bother. I'm sorry I've wasted my time and diluted my memories, seeing this gut.
