Unless you understand the unfortunate excess, this movie will not really mean much to you. An attempt was made to inject a little humanity in a cold and gloomy period consumed by alcohol and drugs, it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak makes her big disco number, her voice is so obvious. Nicknamed is pathetic: producers could at least have gotten someone who sounded remotely like her. <br /> <br /> The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and offers a much more real vision of that period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; However, it does an incredible job.
