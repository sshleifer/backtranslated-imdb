I had high hopes for this film, since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes came to earth in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Neither the performance of Heston nor the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or short nude scenes) could save this film. Some of the spatial effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this one. Grade F
