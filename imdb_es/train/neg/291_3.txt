The film version of Sandra Bernhard's off-Broadway show is jovially pretentious. Sandra talks about saloon and superstar acts, but her sense of irony is just interesting and fun. Your fans will say that it is frankly honest, and that may be true. But she is also shrill, with a bravado without apologies, on your face that does not adapt well to a film of this genre. She does not want to be nice, and she certainly does not want to make friends, and that will always annoy many people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. The filmmaker Nicolas Roeg worked as an executive producer and, although not directed by him, the film has its characteristic and cold style. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; his strangest touch was that all of Sandra's internal audiences seemed completely boring, a feeling that many real viewers will probably share. * 1/2 of ****
