My sincere advice for all: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even go near the theater where this movie is playing! Even a glance is bad for your health. serious. No jokes It's 3:30 in the morning. And I came back from this most horrible movie in this universe. FOUR HOURS !!! I'm proud to have survived after all! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated. irritated. disappointed. It was pure waste of time! the money went to the drain! Without plot I hope that I wake up tomorrow healthy and without memories of this night !! BLONDE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day for each and every one :)
