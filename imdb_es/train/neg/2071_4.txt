I had two reasons to see this swashbuckler when it aired yesterday on Danish television. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida, and she did not disappoint me here. She looked beautiful. Secondly, reading about the film had given me the impression that it presented an absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in the films of Philippe de Broca. For this reason, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found predictable jokes (aside from some witty comments on the subject of war) and completely one-dimensional characters. In addition, the action scenes were performed in a strangely mechanical and uninspired manner, without any sense of drama. I kept looking until the end, but I got bored very fast and I sat there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
