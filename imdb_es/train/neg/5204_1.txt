"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and dumb movie I've ever seen. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There are more activities to walk than in the three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche booklet while watching "Trigger Man" on the way. Horrible. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time and money. I would give that movie 0 stars out of 10, since this is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
