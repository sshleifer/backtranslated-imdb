From the point of view of plot and movement, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater with the hope that it would end and I was relieved after 80 long minutes that fortunately ended. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, the son's girlfriend and two male characters of the child's age that appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homoeroticism, but nothing of what was really revealed in one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son's girlfriend appears in a window outside their room and they engage in a strange conversation. Photography and acting lent an incredible seduction to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting that she had another man who was "older". End of that story.
