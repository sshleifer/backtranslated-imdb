Okay, I'm not going to criticize this movie in depth. I observe the many laudatory reviews before me, and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have had many doubts to make a derogatory comment, and in this way almost a year has passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner moan. Anyway, may the praiseworthy voices annul me! But for other moviegoers like me, be careful. <br /> <br /> Expressed in the simplest and friendliest terms, here is my stance: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and overthrow that provided the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop background for a certain period of my life: through the newspapers I read daily in my local pub in central Europe. At that time, I followed the news reports, but I never fully understood what the hell was happening. Reporters tended to report, either in non-partisan terms, or with a conservatism that disapproved of groups that disturbed the peace or fomented rebellion against the establishment. Those were moments when other winds of agitation swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague and several places in the United States, all whose problems I understand clearly at that time, but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to deal with the Portuguese government simply as The Establishment, not as a well-structured "evil empire," to use terms from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> So, week after week, I read about the riots, but never found an intelligent editorial that could provide the history behind them, or evaluate the practices and socio-economic impacts of the dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> Then, when buying this film, I had at least two hopes: finally understand the details that lead to social unrest, and enjoy a well-conceived drama. This movie did not give me any. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have extensive knowledge and deep emotions regarding historical events. And the drama, well, as I said, I want to encourage María de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but it was trite and shallow. <br /> <br /> I obtained my copy of the DVD of France - "Cannes 2000 Official Selection - Un Certain Regard". The box shows smiling clean-shaven actors, the protagonist who gives the sign of victory in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French might have thought, although as a superficial piece of "real cinema" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand his natural inclination to praise him for his "honesty", but ... <br / > <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Without taking into account chaleuruex sur la Revolution": a cordial greeting? Try to describe the overthrow and murder of Allende with a "cordial greeting"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole line of overthrows and civil rebellions! <br /> <br /> Another revision: María de Medeiros, a person who pays a son, a son, a woman and another story. "Garbage, garbage, garbage! At least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal ... In all of Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and a country It makes an empty film come true, I will keep my old VHS tapes of Black Capes and A Cancao of Lisbon, meanwhile, I am trapped in a zone 2 by the previous title that could also go to the trash.
