History: The film covering 4 odd hours covers in appropriate detail the events in the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and had penetrated deeply into Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To know more about the story, I would suggest that readers read the news related to Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If one is looking for a formula story in this film, then you can be sure that it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many bullets and blood. The movie theater where I saw this movie was full of whistles and cheers when the movie shows Indian Bravery. The audience of the film seemed similar to the audience, as in a cricket match between India and Pak. <br /> <br /> Watch the film as a tribute to the sacrifice of the Army and for the characterization of the heroes of the real-life war (4 heroes honored by the PVC). They have sacrificed their lives so we can see this day. The film has made a brilliant representation of the Army that has fought against all odds in adverse weather conditions. The negative of the film is that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring.
