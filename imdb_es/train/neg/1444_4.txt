The film is very long and, unfortunately, quite different from the novel. If you want to see the movie, then do not read the novel first, as it will surprise you. However, the cinematography was fine and if you are a person who loves the genres of adventures that explore Africa, then do it. Acting performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother instead of a lady who was looking for his father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave, while here it was shown that she was a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
