I have read all the Love Come Softly books. Knowing very well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit, (although both parents come in the book). That is all. The story line was so twisted and so distant and yes, sad, from the book, that I simply could not enjoy it. Even if I did not read the book it was very sad. I know that Pioneer's life was tough, but the whole movie was a disappointment. The qualification is for having the same family orientation of the movie that makes them great.
