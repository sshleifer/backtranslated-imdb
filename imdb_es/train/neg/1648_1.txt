Personally, although I am able to appreciate really good movies, I also have the uncanny ability to enjoy even the most horrible shit. You know, those moments when you just want to sit there and watch a horrible action movie to kill time. This is the only movie that I remember having really turned off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of returning to finish it. The plot was so artificial and predictable, that I was saying what the next scene would be easily (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were horrible, I've seen better acting in high school plays. Even the scene cuts were bad, the flow was incorrect. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot the funny thing.
