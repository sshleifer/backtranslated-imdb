This is the most loaded and clich√©d romantic comedy I've ever seen. Each scene is extremely dignified and the two main actors: Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very silly and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. <br /> <br /> Neve Campbell and the urban Legend killer are the only redeeming qualities in this poor film attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) is in his mid-thirties and the girl he tries to sleep with. It seems that Corey is still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; There is nothing soft about this movie at all. 1/10 Avoid
