In agreement. For starters, the taxi driver is amazing. This, this is not a taxi driver or incredible. what it is is bad but I thought it was very funny, which means that it had some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue ... wow there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid and the film was predicative. There were some places where I thought the movie would be submerged in taxi driver-type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the film in the head much harder. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this movie. Yes, it's worth seeing if you're really bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least try it.
