I saw this movie in DVD format. It is possible that my copy was affected, but I was disappointed by the lack of a menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason to see this movie was Claire Forlani. Although it is fun to watch, I feel that it did not meet my expectations that I have found so far from his other films. In fact, I was pleased to see Arkin become a humorous act. The other two actors I was not very familiar with, so I can not compare their performance, were also quite nice. Acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some might say something convincing, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem comes from the script and not from the direction of this movie. If you enjoy a lot of these actors, then I recommend this movie, but for the rest, leave it alone.
