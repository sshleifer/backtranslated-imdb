This is probably the worst movie I've seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie starring Kevin Costner). <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this movie, and his supporting actors did not even seem like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful comedian, but he can not transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two tense laughs in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this However, the movie, avoid it like the plague. Go to do something constructive and more interesting, such as looking at the weather channel or seeing the paint dries on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give it a 2/10! <br /> <br />
