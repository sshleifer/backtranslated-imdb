... And be disappointed bigger than ever. I will not make any direct reference or anything here, but at the very least, this movie is pathetic. If you have military training, do not bother looking. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends who want to see an interesting action / war movie. Why could not I have read the reviews first? <br /> <br /> Already in the first scene of the "bomb", the film has big flaws, and they continue to show up and get bigger and bigger. My two friends, who were not connected to the army in any way, saw a couple of errors of the filmmaker almost as fast as myself and asked me if some of the things that happen are realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not, at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can ignore these completely idiotic and recurring mistakes that are being made. 2/10 for capturing my interest at the beginning.
