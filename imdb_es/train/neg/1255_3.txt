The acting was bad, the script was bad and the ending was just terrible ... the only good comment I could make about this movie would be the special effects and makeup ... but other than that ... this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001 ... why the hell did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it ... why?
