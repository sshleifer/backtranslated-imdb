I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. That mistake! The acting is a disaster, the special effects (if you could call them that), it seems something that would not be out of place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie that you will shudder as soon as they are on the screen, which unfortunately is very frequent. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, do not waste money on this movie, it has to be one of the worst things I've seen. If, for some reason, you like this movie, look at Troll 2, you will probably enjoy it too.
