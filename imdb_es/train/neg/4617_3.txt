Eight nominations to the academy? It is beyond belief. I can only think that it was a very bad year, even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leaders, I would probably have swallowed the bait and seen this anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and as a result I feel clearly cheated. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy, right? Can anyone tell me where the humor is in Prizzi's honor? No doubt, it has no flavor (the shot in the head of a policeman's wife is just another supposedly comical interlude in this intentional farce about the life of the mafia), but with the exception of a joke about "your Mexican cigars favorites "(which I think is an old joke for Americans who have been officially banned from buying something Cuban for the past 50 years, I could not see anything of a comic nature, and I tried.) There are a lot of clichés of the Mafia, but the cliché does not constitute humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a kind of romantic comedy? Never.The characters and their relationships are so incredible and superficial that they are on par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it an ingenious parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years.The plot is simply mindless nonsense instead of comically absurd, and usually has the feeling of a very bad (and cheap) mafia movie. It feels more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and little humor written for them, the actors are left with unreliable accents and grimaces. Well, it's not enough; even when the teacher of the comic facial expression pulls the face, Jack Nicholson (repeats with the swollen upper lip ... now, does that mean being a parody of Brando's stuffed gills in The Godfather? ... Oh Who, do I care? All I know is that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Launch in a slow and laborious direction (this film lasts for 2 hours), some meaningless and cliché dialogues like; "Do you remember the Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll track you wherever you go," and style manners and you'll hit that fast-forward button before you can say "capiche?" Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's "masterpiece" and it's a pretty poor last job. Definitely, it is a work in the canon of the great director who should be given a specific coat and thrown into the Hudson River.
