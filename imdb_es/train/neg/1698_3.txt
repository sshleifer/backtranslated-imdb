Lynch. Man has some really great things! He knows how to bother us, and then reward us by making us think in different ways. This, however, is totally different. The reward of Dumbland is an absurd comedy of 1%, obtained by supporting a stupidity of 99%. I may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started to see the fast forward. You did not miss anything I was relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. It is an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, which is completed with annoying animations, voices and sounds. But recognizing this and its other absurd qualities still does not make Dumbland worthwhile.
