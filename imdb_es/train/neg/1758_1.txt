If you have not seen him yet, tell him to go ahead, walk through the park, do not waste time. Neither the stage nor the performance are worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide which was worse: the film itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? The interpretative talent of Ellen Pompeo is very questionable, I hope she can improve it over time. The story is simply amazing. Cannon loose American police fighting criminals in Europe on their own? Infamous Slavic mafiosi protected by only two guys. An emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang? Spanish police stupider than a bag of hammers? Give me a break. However, there is only one good thing about this film: at least, the production costs must be lower than those of "Ocean's 12", which were as pointless and as exaggerated as this one.
