I like end-of-day movies. I like serial movies. I was hoping that I would like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the lines that wreak havoc. I could ignore unexplainable events, and the fact that the film is based constantly on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to achieve world peace are the bad ones. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's just boring. Actually nothing happens; almost all the scenes in the film are designed to push the morale of movie makers to viewers, at the cost of having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
