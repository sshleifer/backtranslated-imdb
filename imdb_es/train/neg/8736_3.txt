The film had a good concept, but the execution simply did not measure up. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, as for the story, it's "Dirty Harry" meets "M". A child killer has begun to terrorize a city. The leading detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. The mayor and the police chief, desperate, secretly hire the local mafia to speed things up ... to go places and do things that the police could not do to end this disaster as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie does have some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked the look of the killer's hiding place. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has a mysterious sewer. In some of the shots, the light bounces off the water and creates undulating reflections on the walls; Often, these scenes have a spooky and dreamy quality. <br /> <br /> The performance was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who improves with age. <br /> <br /> Once you get over that, though, it's more or less going downhill. <br /> <br /> The movie is in rhythm. too fast The actual research process of both teams feels very rushed instead of feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been solved in two ways: lengthen the film or cut out some of the many subplots. Any of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the real mystery. <br /> <br /> To see an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial keys that helps them focus on the right suspect is this: at one point in their life, the suspect went to a store pets ... That's right ... I'm serious. It is as if they passed from point A (the first track) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped all the "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones I really liked were the two pockets you found in the middle of the movie. Considering they are secondary characters, I would say it's a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a mafia angle. This is the one that pays me the most because THIS is the reason why I coughed up the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! There has been an absolute excess of serial killer movies in the last 10-15 years. The mafia angle was a trick that COULD have helped him outperform the rest ... but he did not. <br /> <br /> I thought the mobsters' methods would be brutal, but fun and exciting at the same time. ; Something like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they would even throw some elements of the theft movie too. We are talking about criminals, after all. Instead, they give us some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid. The detectives interrogate the witnesses. What does the mafia do? They interrogate them and kill them. It's not even that these witnesses are really that bad either. In fact, I found the criminals less friendly than the killer they are hunting. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to capture your interest, I would say do not miss this opportunity. Maybe one day, reuse the same idea of ​​history and do it CORRECTLY. I hope so. I hate that such a good concept is wasted.
