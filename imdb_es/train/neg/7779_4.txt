The "true" story of a late monster that appears when a US industrial plant begins to pollute the waters. Fun, although not really good, the monster movie has a lot of people trying to get the monster and find out what's going on, but not in a totally immersive way. Give him points for giving us a giant monster that was clearly built to scale for some scenes, but removes some because it looks like a puppy that does not threaten. A funny exploitation movie that is pleasantly silly in the right mood. (My only complaint is that the impression used in Elvira's release is so bad that it looks like a copy of a very worn videotape that had passed its peak 20 years ago).
