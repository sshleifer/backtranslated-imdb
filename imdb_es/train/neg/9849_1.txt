This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life! It's bad, even at the TV Movie level. The plot is devilishly flawed, and the names known in this film are wasted in confusing and uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a movie together, it's so bad. Announced as a "psychological horror thriller", it is certainly horrible. There's nothing exciting about it. And it could hurt you psychological! The first initial scenes were so promising: a possible boarding over if the soul is only one aspect of the brain, but the total confusion that followed the scene of a car crash is beyond belief. No matter how hard you try, you could not care less about the characters. There are so many ideas sprinkled that the film is, at best, a collage of disconnected phrases by Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, the movie will really make you go back to Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I have bought more than 300 movies on DVD, and this is the FIRST one where I am going to get my money back. STAYING AWAY.
