The worst show I've seen in my life. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have superpowers, and when they use some special device, they transform into strange, poorly designed suits. The acting when they are not in the delayed-looking suits is decent. It's definitely not good, but it's not the worst performance I've seen. However, by wearing their costumes, the acting of the actors goes from bad to worse; much, much worse Hyper-animated idiots have a lot of unnecessary movements that they do. Even when they talk, they seem to be having seizures. The villains are stupider than the Rangers. In each episode, some weak and idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers. Then send a force of hyper-animate aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initiate their 10-hour transforming animation, then annihilate the aliens. Then, the evil villain, who may be a villain in armor who really looks and acts badly, to a creature resembling a humanoid ladybug with trumpets stuck to his back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight against the villain, then the villain becomes Godzilla, either by a cloud of rain or by a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot nuclear weapons at the creatures and the creatures become giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summoning their Zords, which are obviously toys in which the producers of the program used special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets angry, they all teach a "valuable" lesson and the show ends. That's. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, false kung fu battles.
