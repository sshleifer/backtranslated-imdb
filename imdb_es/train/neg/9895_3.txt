If this book remained true to the book, then we can only assume that the author ignored the story. Mark Anthony never died from the injuries obtained in the battle as shown. He died to the death of a coward when he committed suicide and even then asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose to commit suicide instead. In the real story, Mark Anthony was embarrassed by the great value of the slave and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. He screamed for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She tugged her litter on ropes and Mark Anthony died shortly after. If you want history do not watch this movie. If you want romantic nonsense then you probably enjoy it!
