I watched this movie twice through a Pentecostal church that my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 70s. I was 6 years old, my brother was 4, then again when I was 8 years old, my brother was 6. The film terrified my brother and me and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It was not only the film, but also the philosophy that involves so many "Christians" about the "mark of the beast" and the rapture. This film, the church and a volatile and negligent education, lead to a severe paranoia towards the future. For years, I lived under the delirious effects of the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. Now I am 40 years old. He went through years of counseling. Once I explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. I was caught in a delusional disorder. In fact, I started to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me that this cult philosophy really happened. I no longer fear the future, I have reached an agreement with the fear injected into its members by the church. I have used this experience to fulfill a purpose, I am approaching my license as a psychologist specialized in childhood trauma.
