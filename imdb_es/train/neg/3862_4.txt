I just saw it. A couple of laughs, but nothing great. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD Gag Reel consists almost exclusively of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be marking a clock, but, again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so "well done", I suppose? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was modern and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (hilariously), in 10 Things I Hate About You is also funny. It's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold the clothes, and I feel like I just did it.
