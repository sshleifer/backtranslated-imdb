There is no doubt about who is in charge of the formation of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier from his cadets, the bomber. But he is not stiff enough to be unfair or hostile. In fact, he even changes his opinion about the value of women who work in the army. It is hard when it has to be, but at other times it is a clear combination of coach and pastor, roles that he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural on paper and interprets it elegantly. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular end of special effects.
