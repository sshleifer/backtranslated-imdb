This show is boring, lame, and basically starts all kinds of things to make it "original". First: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is horrible ... and everyone is upset. The twins resemble the female Dexter teens in "Dexter's Lab," and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Lab"). Secondly, the plots ... are painfully boring, which makes them difficult to follow. The gags are cheesy, and nothing makes me feel really forced to laugh a little ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but those only turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third: the whole theme song begins with the melody of "American Idiot" by Green Day. And, although I'm not a big fan of that band, it seems really silly to me to take the same opening melody and then subtly change it to make it their own. <br /> <br /> Case At the point ... it's a big, ugly, fat hole. 1/10
