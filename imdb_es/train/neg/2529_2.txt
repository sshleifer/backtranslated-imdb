Bobby is a silly child who smiles too much and wants sex. So he buys a truck to help with this search. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is nothing more than a chain of clichés and little loose emotions. The creators of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the madness of other films of the time, but they fell short. They even turn to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add a comic value. <br /> <br /> I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another kind of classic DeVito role, but it's just a supporting actor and it's there for cliché value.
