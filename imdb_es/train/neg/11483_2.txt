I was totally encouraged to watch this movie. I had been waiting a year for it to clear up here in New Zealand. I should not have built myself that much because it was so disappointing and it's definitely Clark's worst movie. There is a lot of evil with this movie. First of all, some of the performances are great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most were so out of touch and incredibly amazing. , especially Leo Fitzpatrick. Now he is a veteran of Clark's films and was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he reverses his lines with such solemnity that he turns his scenes into a virtual parody. The script felt as if it had been written by a first-year film student. I'm not sorry, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaning of the existence of these children? It sure did not stop him from getting into a fucking pervert. I'm not rude, but I did not need to see the breasts and buttocks of teenagers every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I think you'll never get over it.
