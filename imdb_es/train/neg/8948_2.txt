'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and nobody can be trusted. It's a very dark movie and it will not make you feel good about yourself. It is a romance that takes place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and that human nature is self-centered. The film has some very good ideas and it is good to portray this society with dark tones in colors (in contrast to happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects, people and places. However, despite the cunning of the film to portray this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to understand it at all. He seemed to spend too much time being smart instead of telling a story.
