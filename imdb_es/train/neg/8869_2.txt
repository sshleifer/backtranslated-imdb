With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry has really bottomed out. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a quiet life for the past few years with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day, an old friend of Stefan arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan is doing a small messenger job. He is supposed to bring a suitcase full of heroin through customs in Sweden and Germany. Unfortunately, things in Germany do not work as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish movie that breaks the traditional pattern of family drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight of the film is the unprovoked sexual scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts only a few seconds, leaving approximately 90 minutes of purity, let's say what it really is, garbage.
