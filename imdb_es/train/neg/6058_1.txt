A plot that tore apart and stank of irreconcilable differences of opinion constituted a critical chaos with one pro-life side and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was omitted and replaced by a dull effect in general, possibly to be horrible, but, instead, it showed a bad dose of beliefs that ridiculed each other, despite the title itself. Being a Masters of Horror fan from the beginning, this ridiculous twist of the plot with its sordid depictions crumbled like an old rocking chair after sitting. I see this episode as launched from the beginning, it never really took off anywhere else other than to see how it's worth it and alleviate it when it finally came to "The End".
