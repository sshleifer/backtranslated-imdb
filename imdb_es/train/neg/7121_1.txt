When you have a disembodied skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a naive engineer and a gardener nutzo, throw a minister and his wife. What do you have? <br /> <br /> The AIP response to insomnia. <br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" gets points for daring, offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fear for watching the movie. A pretty sure bet, when people who believe they are in a production of "Suspense for Dummies" relax in a stupor. <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a cute girl, anyway. She had some good acting moments here and there (especially when trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else fills a nightgown like her. But that frightened face that she makes ... is scary in itself. Whoa <br /> <br /> On the whole, however, there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime. You can not be scared with this movie, it's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, thanks to one Mike Nelson and his two robot friends, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy that SHE got ("The movie jumped, and it was really scary!" ). <br /> <br /> A star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about a "screaming" hole ....
