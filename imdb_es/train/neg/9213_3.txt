I captured this movie in a small screening made by members of the gambling club of my university. We were warned that this would be the "craze of the coolers" of the games and this movie more than the one that was presented. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who starts his college career after "resting" for a while. semester. What we, the viewer, discovered as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was an irremediable addict to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game he comes back to know after a group of players recruits him to a bell. . <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous on many, many levels. One of the scenes shows the group "games by candlelight", which is probably the best way to describe it. Although I'm sure this was meant to be "cult" in some way, as most players know, it's horribly inaccurate. Most role play sessions are held in well-lit rooms, usually with some chee-tohs and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> The performance, although not of the caliber of the Oscar, is not so terribly horrible either. . This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still one or two years beyond the horizon. The cast of cast, although not very memorable, still offers decent performances. <br /> <br /> Mainly, the evil lies in the fact that it was a movie made for television that shows the "dangers of the game". See if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
