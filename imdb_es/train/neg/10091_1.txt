I can not believe that this movie was created. I think that at some points the director is trying to turn it into an artistic piece, but this only makes it worse. The zombies seem to have applied too much makeup on their eyes. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies in total, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one, is the credits, because the painful experience was finally over. Again to reiterate the comments of other users, voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense throughout the film. In addition, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl that simply does not make any sense. It is never explained.
