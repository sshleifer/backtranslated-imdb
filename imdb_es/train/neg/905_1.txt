A single woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is pregnant by a rich man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her for a sense of obligation, but she rejects him and decides to raise the child on his own. Things go well until the girl named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually get worse (and as expected). <br /> <br /> I have seen the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". Neither of them affected me very much (and I cry easily) but they were well made if they were dated. Trying to redo this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to achieve it. This (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and is dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado give good performances, this film really drags and in the end I got bored with a fool. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help to support the roles. Endeble and boring. Really, who thought this would work? See the 1937 version Stanwyck instead. I give this a 1.
