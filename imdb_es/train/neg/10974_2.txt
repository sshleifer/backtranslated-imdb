I am Irish and I have been living in Denmark for a while, so I was anxious to go back home last week to see Intermission. And I will leave a record of what has been said: <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS IMPONENT. <br /> <br /> He's not as bad as the "Most fertile man in Ireland", but he's definitely not standing there with other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are quite funny, like the American-style Garda Colm Meaneys. But the movie itself is shot completely wrong. The rebound of the camera and the constant approach and distance try to give the film a cutting edge look as if it were a rough drama. But is not. It is an Irish barrel, shares and two smoking barrels, and must be fired in this way. It must have a smooth movement from one shot to another. The movie just looks sloppy and thrown. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine, given the horrible script. A friend of mine told me that it was as if they had only followed Colin Farrell through Dublin for a week. It gives a decent exhibition like a Dublin Dirtbag, but it does not compare with its performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was that of Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a middle-aged woman with sexual frustration who has just been abandoned by the manager of her bank, the husband, by a younger woman. I think he should leave his frightening posture and focus more on his performance. <br /> <br /> In general, it does not meet the expectations of the Irish press or it deserves it. even to be considered one of the best Irish films of all time. <br /> <br /> I am expecting a backlash from these comments because most of the people I have spoken with have said that it was great. But before answering, ask yourself: Would you think this movie so well if it were set in England or the United States?
