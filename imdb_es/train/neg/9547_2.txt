A video game of appearance inferior to the average one becomes a species of conspiracy so that the next terrorist is shortage in the backyard of EE. UU Welcome to the madness of low-cost video movies. It is full of actors and actresses with no name with an unworthy plot. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game continues and our "hero" bets real money and does it well. It's a kind of game, except that the game part is gone and sucks. Instead, it's an online game with little real value and you'll get authorities in your queue if you do it right. <br /> <br /> What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs struggle in some way and everything is saved in the end. I will leave the viewer to see how it materializes. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not even worth the $ 1 rent. Lend it, please "RE-"
