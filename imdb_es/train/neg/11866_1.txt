First, this movie says he won the "best movie" at the "Worldfest" film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I would not call this the worst movie in history, but it certainly sucks, it's more or less as terrible as another B-grade student "Body Melt", but at least that movie did not look like to have been filmed in the HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I suppose the filmmakers saw many Troma movies and Gore movies very badly, thinking that they could also break into the business by releasing this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love very low quality movies, just the fact that some of the characters put fake American accents, almost as if they did. It gives them more opportunity to sell it in the states or something like that. A really disappointing final too, the match could have been much more exciting, and some good fight scenes. You can see completely that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad taste" with everything, the explosion of a car, the rocket launcher and countless people who are shot down, but the end lacks humor or style as "bad" " taste. "<br /> <br /> If you like to watch really bad gore movies, or if you are interested in making movies without a budget, look at it, otherwise, go away.
