Horrible! Absolutely horrible! No plot, no point, no end. It seems that the director turned on the camera and then the whole team went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to give this video away, but nobody will take it. I give it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'm going to have to say the opposite. <br /> <br />
