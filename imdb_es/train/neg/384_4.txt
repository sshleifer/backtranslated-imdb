I do not give much credibility to AIDS conspiracy theories, but it is interesting from the sociological point of view to see the dramatized phenomenon. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the frightened and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme San Francisco demi-ma. The city, famous for its beauty, has rarely appeared more ugly than in this movie. A sense of darkness and decay invades every scene. <br /> <br /> While the performance and the plot can not be said to be well done, the unique cultural context of the film and the oppressively dark humor at least in part prevent the film from being a complete loss. Actually, I found that the most interesting performance was Irit Levi as a Jewish police detective, lesbian (?) Jewish and cynical, crusty and cynical. It is interesting, although it is not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: the use of the ostentatious Turandot movie is an effective motif and there is a sublime and silent cameo of the iconic performance artist, Ron Athey.
