This is not a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that resemble the unedited results of a 10-year-old boy with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have the theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor, the one with the greasy hair, the lost look, the ipod and the nervous tic, probably filmed herself in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you got beyond the ten minutes I did, do not bother trying to fit what you saw in the context of the European Artist mentality praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine shudder. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless series of characters packed in vacuum is representative of what now passes for much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors filming social relationships at the Wal-Mart snack counter?
