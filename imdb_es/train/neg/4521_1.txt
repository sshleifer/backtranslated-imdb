The entire Biker Movie genre must be made up of the worst movies ever made. This offers many combats, generous amounts of blood, cyclists who fight against the Indians and a shantytown that explodes and knocks down one hut at a time. The acting is more than terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point, he was in some of the major studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie really explodes, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it's a good image to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little careless to have seen it!
