"You're not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place, they did not hurt you, they can be radioactive in the second place." Ah, the joys of science fiction without 50s budget? However, despite the strange gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men are quite uninspiring, even with a run time of 58 minutes. It's more than cheap (Superman's flying shot is an incredibly inept animation box with few frames) and quite boring, although it has a surprisingly altruistic message. The silent Mole-Men, tiny actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats that look more like Mr. Mxyzptlk without a hat than the underground bugs, freed from their underground world by means of oil drilling are not malicious, they are simply misunderstood, and the Man of Steel of George Reeves tries to avoid that the local mafia of a small town led by Jeff Corey kills them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
