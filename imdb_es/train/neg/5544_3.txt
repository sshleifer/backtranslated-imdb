While this film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, it is surprisingly visible on several levels. First, for fans of old movies, it is interesting to see the main role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later assumed a very respectable role as a supporting actor (he even won the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him from this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This movie only shows that if an actor can not act in his previous films does not mean he can not learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst movies of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A second reason to watch the movie is its recklessness . everyone. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are waded through the water, it is obvious that they are really walking in their place and the bottom is badly projected behind them. Also, once they get out of the water, their suits are 100% dry! The horrendous continuity and the meaningless bad dialogue abound throughout the film, to the point that it is hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film, since both starred in many horror movies of grade zero. . In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if I give it a 3 it's probably a little too generous, it's fun to laugh And short, so it's worth seeing for the bad movie fans.
