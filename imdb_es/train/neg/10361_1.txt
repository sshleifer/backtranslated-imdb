This failure of ABC direct to TV does not do justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Mrs. Madeleine L'Engle took children and adults alike to a magical, fantastic and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in its "quartet of time", is a beautiful version of life, the universe and time itself. However, it is easy to understand for any child or teenager. His unwavering morality prevails throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing more than a mockery of Ms. L'Engle's artwork. Honestly, what were you thinking? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is soft and uneven, the dialogue is implausible and almost all the magical characteristics of the novel have been lost. This was a horrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent and dignified director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) makes another attempt to bring this book to the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to the boring, fake and cheap art of a motel room that has no basis and has no impact on the audience.
