Arthur Askey's great ability as a comic was in the way he communicated with his audience. His youthful jokes, silly songs and nonsense dances were good because he was able to involve people and draw them to his world outside the wall. The lack of a live audience was a clear disadvantage for him, and he was never completely comfortable in the movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been designed to make the most of his talents, but Askey, the artist, needed to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in The Movie is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a silly honeymoon couple; Linden Travers goes over like a 'crazy'. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who off the screen married Phyllis Calvert, as the main character, who gave a totally insipid reading of the part, and with the protagonist Carol Lynne, who appears in an equally insipid performance. It remains for character actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a single lover of parrots that is shattered by Dr. Morland Graham's brandy.
