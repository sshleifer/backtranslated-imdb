There are two points that I need to clarify at the beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscars were REALLY treated of. It was the way the Academy showed people that they are not racists and never have been. They wanted to erase all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is a bit pointless to comment on the program, because really, what difference will it make? But, it's fun to write about that. This is the year I got fed up with the Oscars! I will never see the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when the real winner should have been Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, look at it and you will agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when it was released did not receive nominations. And as far as this year is concerned, well, bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann does not get the "Best Director" nomination! Are you kidding? "A Beautiful Mind" is ready for "Best Makeup" ???? "Training day" is nominated? The movie was horrible, and it seemed that Washington did not even show up at a presentation, all he tried was that he knows how to use four-letter words! That's why he won the prize! He removes the language and I bet he was almost playing himself. I liked "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how on Earth Altman can not give it too! I mean, come on, if we're just giving the prize to people to clear up any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and not Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about the Oscars this year, but, I'll live with that, as long as I never have to see another show again. The highlight (and the ONLY) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance at the awards ceremony. That will happen as one of the best moments in the history of the show.
