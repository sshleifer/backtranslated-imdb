Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare games, it has been seriously left here. The bad direction, the stagnant study work and the erratic performances ruin a good tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the city of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been fighting for centuries, but tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet The bloodshed soon explodes ... <br /> <br /> The study work, especially in the daytime scenes, seriously paralyzes the energy of the work. It is a story that, with its energy, deserves to be filmed outdoors. Along with this, the costumes are horrible, with too many meshes and ridiculous pieces of code. The fight on the stage seems horrible, with too much stretching and running to be attractive. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the plot is set in motion, but his majestic and soft accent, often inexpressive, limits his range. It is very difficult for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet. Capture the naivety of the character, but a little more anger would have been welcomed. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles are not much better. Friar Laurence by Joseph O'Connor is fine, but many of his best lines have been eliminated. Mercutio by Anthony Andrews belongs to the stage and not to the camera. Gurns and gesticulates excessively and as a result it seems pretty ridiculous. Alan Rickman, minimizing his role, practically has no presence as Tybalt. He developed an advantage and intensity to offer some fine screen functions in later years, but that is not evident here. The Prince may be a good role with his brief appearances, but actor Lawrence Naismith gives no authority to the part before the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, probably in his best role in this series, comes out of this with dignity. His Capulet is well played and it is a pleasure to see him. <br /> <br /> Instead, see one of the other versions of this story.
