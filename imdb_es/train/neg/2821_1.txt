I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has very little or no plot and seems to be nothing more than continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it was starring Zoe Trilling of the second "Night of the Demons"; And I wanted to see her playing somebody normal. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's script is just beginning and is not going anywhere, since Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the stage and the plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; Hiding from this movie!
