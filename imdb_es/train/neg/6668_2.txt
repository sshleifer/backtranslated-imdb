The longer this movie went on, and it seems that it lasted tediously forever, the more annoying I became, frankly, what a waste of time sitting on this total nonsense. How the hell can people make movies like this, or even get funding for such nonsense? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings in IMDb, since that shows that you can fool some of the people all the time. And in this image, the main players have an obsession with weapons, so it is not difficult to develop the way in which this film will ultimately develop. The United States can never understand that the rest of the world finds it strange that society in the United States has such an obscene and fatal "weapons culture". <br /> <br /> Anyway: <br /> <br /> The main actor portrays a loser who escapes the fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl. He meets a family with two spoiled spoiled children, a teenager and a child; Attended by a strict single father who can barely cope. The cowboy is seduced by the teenager or vice versa, and the impressionable boy seems to be caught by the madness of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all his time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then works to live, and then commits a robbery in his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to see a sad loser failed in a fantasy world with a death wish, or even see a poor family that is not really So much better than white trash ?! <br /> <br /> This movie does not make sense drivel. <br /> <br /> He only saves himself from getting the lowest possible mark by means of music that can be heard half-heartedly: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
