Let me tell you first, I saw this movie around midnight, and there's usually only junk around this time, but this movie broke the record <br /> <br /> First of all, the main character is a creepy old unattractive, however, he gets af * ck to all the girls that come in his way, for example, he goes to a store, he talks to a girl and then you see them f * ck <br /> <br /> in second place, there's a lot of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, I would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie said: put on your clothes fast to be able to f * ck! <br /> <br /> Thirdly This film should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family. This movie only shows a soft erotic and misinterpreted, so I wonder why those actors accepted to play in that garbage.
