Poor Michael Madsen; It must be kicked to know that people have heard about this horrible movie. I really can not think of anything worse I've seen, except amateur porn. It's so bad, and everything here; acting on wood, bad script, horrible moral ending, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is: "Who the hell put $$$ on this piece of doggie?" At least we could have seen Michael's sister, Virginia, naked in a scene, but I do not think that even that would save this stench ... <br /> <br /> For a great guy who has done some exceptional films, I want to know what crazy Church sponsored this piece of crapola.
