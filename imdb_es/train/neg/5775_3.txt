They are showing this in some outside the network. It's good shit. While it's not as bad as the B-movies that show up on the science fiction network on Saturdays, but it's still a pretty big pile of trash. The acting is passable. The plot and the writing are quite sub-standard and the rhythm is completely too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where things are ending before the credits, not the top of the movie, the outcome. In addition, large portions of the cast seem too old for the age range they are playing. Everything is predictable, boring and not worthy of being observed. Save your time It's not even worth the time it takes to see it for free.
