Apparently, this is a Z-grade DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading that book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You came here, now you can go out again!" (after taking a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listening to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it is not so clear what this film did in the era known for post-structuralism , it is really about, or if it is simply a bad cinematographic realization. The acting is atrocious, but some actors I know, so are they doing it? <br /> <br /> An old house, obviously cut with a contemporary home, is the site of the murders. A (bad) film is made in the field and the story repeats itself again.
