Summary: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory on how to produce energy, knowledge that could unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately desires to leave the Soviet Union. KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology. Therefore, they start a scheme. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB intervenes, takes Markov to a secret location and entices him to reveal his secret by saying that they are in Sweden and working for the UN. In support, the KGB kidnaps Markov's daughter. The CIA now sends its best agents, a team of Ninjas (Swedish?) To thwart the KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult film that, despite not being very good, needs to be seen. The film is quite ambitious but lacks many areas. The first thing is that it is very dark, probably to hide locations and negative effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what is happening. The second thing he lacks is the martial arts, despite being a ninja movie. Of course there are some, quite bad quality, but mostly ninjas shoot automatic weapons or sets of explosions. Automatic weapons are also a problem, since they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets, while the Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What does that have that talks about that then? The most important idea and ambition. Some really, and especially for a Swedish movie, decent action scenes but not martial arts. Some nice scenes in slow motion and enough blood and blood. And some very interesting new weapons technologies that make victims explode the heart or the brain. Mainly all the parts you are looking for in a B movie. <br /> <br /> As it is definitely a B movie, you can not make any mistakes there. But if you wait, and you see it as a B movie, it's entertaining. But do not forget, it's not just a B series movie that takes place in the eighties. Some girls, for example, besides using ... let's say "interesting" clothes, have lethal doses of eyeshadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In general, consult the status of cult and ambition. Enjoy it and then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
