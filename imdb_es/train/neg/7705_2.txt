(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should have calculated. The DVD did not even show the time or how much time it was. I thought that Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I had ever seen. This is much worse. Has no sense. Plot thrown together. Everything so that we can see the large breasts in a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It had to have been a student movie. That must have gotten a grade C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I discovered it was not going to end). the end does not make any sense <br /> <br /> reproducible: 0/10
