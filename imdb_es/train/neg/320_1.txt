With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most idiotic movies ever made. It's about the cruise waiter Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a comedian on the cruise. First of all, there is not a funny or intelligent line in the whole movie honestly. It's so funny that it's pathetic. Surprisingly there is not much raw or sexual humor, but the word "f" is abundant. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the movie. It takes place on a cruise, but it seems that they only had money to rent a small boat and they only had money for 10 boat extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are lively and cheap, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone who sees this will also hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for the language.
