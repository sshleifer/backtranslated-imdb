Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (based on class films like "Sling Blade", "A simple plan" and "The man who was not there", among others), it was inevitable that it would be the weird turkey there. What I did not realize, however, is that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this movie is: the most fun dialogue is this: "Knock Knock", "Who's there?", "The great man who sucks", "The great man who sucks", "The great man who sucks, you are YOU". Yes folks, it's really that bad. Billy Bob is only in this for about two minutes (I guess he needed the job at that point in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. Although for some reason, although it is undeniably horrible, I do not hate it. Probably because I keep my anger for any high budget, special effects loaded with junk like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a "no budget" movie like this one. 2/10 in a push.
