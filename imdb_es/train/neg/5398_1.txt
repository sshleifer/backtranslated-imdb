This self-indulgent disorder may have made Mr. Branagh's career fashionable as a Shakespearean film adapter. (Launched 4 years ago, I do not think there has been an adaptation since then). I just finished seeing this on the wire: Holy God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the feeling of a critic below who said that. To review something so obvious and lamentably horrible is an ungenerous act that presents itself as acute. That said, I'll risk it, if only because * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who overestimated Mr. Branagh's director skills in the past. Branagh has always been a terrible director: with a literal mentality; star unforgivably ungenerous with his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, making sure he has all the good lines). <br /> <br /> In that sense, the sad thing is that * Love's Labor's Lost * is just worse than the endless, frightening, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996. In fact, this movie may be preferable, if only because It is approximately 1/3 of the length. Branagh decided that it would be a good idea to update this early Shakespeare's bad work in the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he puts the thing in 1939, leaves an eighth part of the text intact in favor of atrocious interpretations of the standards of the 1930s (wait to see the actors raised in wires to the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven") , and Cast of actors not known for their dancing or singing (including himself). The result is a disaster so surreal that one is stupefied that they simply did not stop him horrified after looking at the first newspapers. I do not even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing!" NO ONE could do well in this hodge-podge: the illustrious former student of CSR is no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could act in this? <br /> <br /> The first error of Branagh was to think that "Love's Labor's Lost" was a work that is worth filming. Trust me, it is not. It is an anomaly in Bard's canon, written expressly for an educated clique of courtiers, NOT the usual audience for which he wrote. Therefore, there are a lot of precious word games (and TEDIOSOS), references to contemporary school nonsense, parodies of * Euphues * by Lyly. . . In other words, hardly the kind of material to attract a broad audience. Hell, it does not attract an audience already predisposed to Shakespeare's comedy. The work can not be organized without drastically cutting the text and "refreshing" it desperately with any contraption that comes along. What the question raises: Why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that the cream pie of a Shakespeare play could be served with a secondary order of the Gershwin jam. Clearly, the idea, or hope, was to make an unintelligible Elizabethan exercise acceptable to modern audiences while managing nostalgia for American pop culture at the same time. But, again, this raises the question: Why bother? <br /> <br />
