I could not believe it I had to rub my eyes a couple of times. It was true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins; they all have some kind of talent, but here they were all in what basically adds to a Cinemax-style skin movie. On board a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, "Alien Intruder" tries to be unique, with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call it Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this type of high-tech virtual reality station to board a spaceship where four men can live their fantasies while the system is supervised by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here everything develops as a well-padded episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams overcomes all classes of right and left, and it seems that he would rather be doing something else, anywhere else. Oh, the things that people do for money ... <br /> <br /> The FX are pretty static, maybe even less than you would expect from a person as cheap as this one. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than one would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, gets ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that is mocking and brainless, check out "Alien Intruder." Of course, you probably do not have to look beyond Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, not even for the power of the star that this movie can muster. <br /> <br /> Leave this lost in space.
