I saw the Peter of the Rings version of Peter Jackson when he was halfway through reading the Two Towers and I thought he was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this time the animated version of The Lord of the Rings was released in DvD, but I said to myself that I will finish reading The Two Towers and The Return of the Kings before I saw it (as I thought) that showed the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was actively bored for 20 minutes, which was really weird because I love the book and I'm surprised that the creator of this movie could even think about fitting in at least one and a half of the books in a movie of 2 hours and 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had any emotion when they talked and they seemed like I read it from a page, even my favorite character, who is Gandalf, did not seem at all interesting. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only correct thing in some parts of the movie, except for the orcs (they looked very bad) and Aragorn and Sam face each other. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good for the manufacturer to run out of money because the film could not have improved. <br /> <br /> I just hope that nobody judges the books of this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
