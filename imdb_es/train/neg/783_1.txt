I saw this program and I just did not find it funny. It could have been the first episode. Lately, I realize that ABC is playing in a lot of stupid programs nowadays and it is falling like a station. All the characters in this program are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and the script are pretty horrible and even then they could end the program. I would say that I think this program will be canceled, but since ABC is doing quite badly for the quality of the programs they are playing, it is possible that they will keep this simply because it is average compared to them.
