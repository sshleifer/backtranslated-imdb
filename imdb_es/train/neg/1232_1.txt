['It says that a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this &quot;movie&quot;. No wonder he does not have other credits in his name for writing or directing. She made a serious vocational mistake by choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /><br /> The downside of this film, aside from its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete failure of LOGIC. <br /><br /> ** After she leaves the mall, four bullies approach her while they surround her. Tell me, what woman would aggressively AMAZE a potential attacker while surrounded, and verbally insult? I do not want to say after an attack has already started, because, of course, it is completely normal for someone to defend themselves. But she pushed that boy and practically scaled him to the next level. No woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) had the confidence to know that the backup is very close, and therefore is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak of appearance that she is quite sure she can take them. None of that was applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone who is asking to be raped or robbed. And, by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he got to see Kim Basinger, why did not she run to him for help or scream? <br /><br /> ** When she leaves after the security guard is shot in the head, she drives to a deserted part of the city, and crashes. He had a good three-minute lead over the pursuers, instead of just running on foot in a diagonal direction behind the houses and climbing fences and continuing, he pulls out his red Toolbox and starts playing under his hood. I understand that she was trying to fix her car, but she should have run. <br /><br /> (I did not even want to say this is a chronological summary of the film, because I hate the people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence in this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I should comment on that. ). <br /><br /> ** Why would he carry a noisy red toolbox while trying to sneak away in the dark? When they catch her, one of the pranksters asks her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then opens it. And take out a key. This scene here is so rich in subtle nuances of the total failure of the dramatic effect that I have to decompose, it&#39;s one of the dumbest scenes in the whole movie. When asked to open the box, she resists at the beginning as if it were her plan to get one of the thugs to open it out of anger after she did not open it, in the same way that someone in an action movie could have a device that an enemy asks that person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy takes that device, only for that device to automatically dispense a chemical / fire in the face / render Him unconscious, which was the hero&#39;s plan all the time. I feel that&#39;s what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as he opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly pulls out a KEY, dispatches one of the thugs and, in some way, RETREATS from him and the others three thugs. <br /><br /> ** Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this woman from the house in the suburbs, who sneaks through the forest while loading her red Toolbox, taking out various tools that are used as weapons to KILL ITS ATTACKERS. <br /><br /> ** When she was running away, how did she end up moving back to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had the radio playing loudly in homage to the dead guy. She somehow crawled towards them when I thought she was getting away from them. <br /><br /> ** Finally, all this premise is so weak because the whole reason she was persecuted in the first place is because from the point of view of the thugs, she witnessed a murder they committed against the security officer before, so They felt they had done it. to kill her How ridiculous. As even one of the thugs said, they could have left town and returned to the city they were traveling from, nobody, except her, had seen them anyway, and she probably did not get the license plate. Even if these possibilities do not work in your favor, how does raising the hell and chasing someone to kill them increase your chances of getting away with the original murder?']
