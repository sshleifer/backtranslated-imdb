There are so many negative comments about "Stay away, Joe" here. I can no longer keep quiet and let this injustice happen. Here is a side you have not heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for one simple reason: they are perfect films for pure relaxation because I do not have to think when I see them. That means that I do not have to worry about losing a complex plot because there is never a suitable plot to start with. I can take off my shoes, drink a beer, sit down, disconnect my brains and enjoy all the general nonsense and the rock and roll catchy melodies of the most wonderful decade of all. <br /> <br /> In my books "Alejate, Joe" definitely falls into the category "so bad that it's good". Now, if you're like me and appreciate "the value of garbage," this is the best camping experience of the 1960s. It's so bad that it's almost surreal to look at and, just when you think it can not be worse, it surprises you in the most imaginable way. In the end, you are so surprised by all the new levels of stupidity that you simply do not know whether to laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it's so funny that there was once a generation that really made movies like this. Even so, I give it 1 out of 10, but once it reaches the top 100 it will become a classic of the movie.
