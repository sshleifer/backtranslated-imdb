What the heck of a D-Movie was that? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / stories I've found. The only good thing here was Coolio, who had a good cameo like a scared cop. However, the rest of the movie is horrible and boring. It's not even that bad, you can laugh at that. Just a simple shit. And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead series could also compare Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones (well, well, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
