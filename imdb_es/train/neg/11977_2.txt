Roy Rogers and the company try to make "Sintown" come back to life: it is a ghost town that can grow if silver mining succeeds. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") hits around. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses a bit of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' keen eye. Foy Willing and the Riders of the substitute purple sage (or, is that singing?) For the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail." A loose floor board offers the winning comedy. Mr. Devine's mule kicks his heels. There are also energetic human actions, but the material is not great. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
