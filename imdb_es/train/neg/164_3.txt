I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was waiting for this. I was intrigued by the pre-exaggeration descriptions of the Enterprise, its narrow submarine style and its crude technology compared to the Treks we're used to. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything so interesting in this pilot I discovered that the plot was complicated and confusing. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that I liked something about the development of the character: the representations of humans as a 'teenage' species ready to outdo their witches were entertaining. <br /> <br /> And that Vulcan babe had an incredible and incredible shelf. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'm hooked with this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
