I, my boyfriend and our friend saw this "movie" if that's what you want to call it, and we agree with the last person, but we were stupid and we bought the damn thing, we thought it was really Devil, so we bought it. <br /> <br /> we really hate it SUXZ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so be careful: DO NOT BUY THIS THING THAT CALL A MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> We would return it, but not No, if someone wanted this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another thing, you should not call it "The Devil's Legend", you should call it "Legend of Chance". <br /> <br /> and this movie is classified as R ????? This should not even have been qualified. <br /> <br /> We think Diablo would be crying with laughter for this stupid movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that would have been made. for a Church. <br /> <br /> these "actors" will never become anything because of this movie.
