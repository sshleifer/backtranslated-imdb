Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst comedies. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried it more than once and I can not go through a full episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting is horrible. Everyone is exaggerating to the point where it is annoying to see him. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language. I have seen better acting in a kindergarten play. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, IT IS NOT FUNNY. The plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or FUN. Should not it be a funny comedy? Why am I not laughing? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventies about? It is as authentic for the seventies as "Happy Days" was for the fifties. <br /> <br /> OH and what about Ashton Kutcher? Who launched this dweeb without talent? And now he's making movies? Ah, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think that this is quality television, I worry.
