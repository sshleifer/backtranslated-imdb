No one, but no one, could chew the stage as the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example of this. Although she sometimes plays the role too much, look at her when she is surprised that Raliegh writes the lyrics of a song that her bridesmaids are about to play: at that moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to govern and govern absolutely! At other times, she ends up with the sappiness of the script. When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she is weak and cunning. This has the additional effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her battery and threatens to impart justice, it is difficult to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex was able to attack his It delves into Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally unsuited to convey the complexity and sheer evil of man. It also does not help that Essex is badly subscribed. Why is this the exalted one who wants to overthrow his Queen, even when he swears allegiance to her, except that he is more of blue blood, and therefore more "worthy" of the rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He does not risk losing the favor, and we know where Essex is heading (and his head). So why does he risk his own head by accelerating the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the $$$ they gave him? He does not even bother trying to hide the fact that his battle scenes are recorded in a sound stage. I should have finished it with Elizabeth the first time alone in La Torre; Everything that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me or Bette looks exactly like Susan Sarandon?
