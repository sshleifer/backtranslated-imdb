Oh dear, oh dear. I started to see this without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to drop a man, who is unarmed, and wait for him to capture it and escape with a rocket. If only it were really so easy. I finally found a movie worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space."
