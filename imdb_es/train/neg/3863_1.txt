Wow. That is all I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? What self-respecting actor would accept to "act" on these things? Oh my God! I do not know how I survived this movie, but I assume that the fact that I had taken about 8 cups of coffee that day was the key to keeping me awake. Good sir! It was one of the longest and most predictable film pieces I've ever seen ... and for the record, I never plan to 'witness' it again. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time The movie when I bought the DVD (ERROR # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She's great. I'll see it as soon as I get home (ERROR # 2). I tried to see him without moaning every five minutes asking me when this pile of shit would end, I really did. But I did not succeed. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. I mean ... what about that thing where you imagine what would happen and then go back to real life? That was quite annoying when the father used to do that in 'Parenthood' ten years ago. The 'jokes' - and BELIEVE, it costs me a LOT to call it that - are stupid, the characters are trite and forgettable, the story is completely predictable ... all this makes for a movie that must be deleted RECORDS OF HISTORY! I should have imagined that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. It was probably a direct DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone thinking of seeing this, I have some advice. DO NOT! For the love of God ... NO! I am ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody, and I want to say that NO ONE wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking about second-hand and second-hand shops that would buy mud from your shoes and stick it in the store window. That should let you know what CRAP is like.
