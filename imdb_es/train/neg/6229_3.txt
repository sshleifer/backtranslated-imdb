First of all, let's clarify some things here: a) I AM an anime fan, it has always been that way (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer in Preschool). b) I like several B movies because they are fun. c) I really like Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Happening, when the movie opens, it looks like it's going to be your usual B movie, up to the effects of shit, but all of a sudden- BOOM! The anime is turned on! This is when the movie moves WWWAAAAAYYYYYY down down. <br /> <br /> The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than I remember SPEED RACER, for the crissakes! In fact, it is very cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie that I remember "vividly" is when a group of children runs out of school ... and they are the same children again and again! The FX are also terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Also, the transition from the live action to the animation is not organized, the dialogue and the voices (especially the English dub that I saw) was horrible and I asked my dad to take out the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was making jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike in MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I'm planning to show this to another friend otaku my friend on Halloween for a B- Movie Night. Because it is stupid, quite painful to watch and, unintentionally, hilarious at the same time, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I was originally going to give it. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means pretty boring and bad.) As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will be as fun as counting up fifteen.)
