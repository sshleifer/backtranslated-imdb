This has to be the worst horror movie I've seen. I remember seeing it years ago, when it first came out on video and for some strange reason, I thought I had enjoyed it. Then, like an idiot, I ran out to buy the DVD once it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother to enter the plot because it is so transparent that you can see it anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheesy gore effects and bad acting, but these people take this to a completely different level. It's almost as if they intentionally tried to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they succeeded. If you intended to make a movie that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in some way, shape or form that is real, then they failed ... MISERABLE! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis of the plot and you have seen it!
