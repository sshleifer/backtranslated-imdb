With no affinity with any type of film, and with a healthy appreciation of the documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry at myself for bothering to sit me down during "20 Dates". I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. However, I will say that Berkowitz's Woody Allen-style narration was extremely annoying. Either you wanted her to leave the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it is possible that Berkowitz himself realizes that this film was a bad idea, since parts of it detail his essays to finance the documentary. Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I'll give Berkowitz credit for having the skills to convince an idiot to fund this horrible piece of shit. I appreciate the limits and intentions of the film here, but even when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets for himself, it shoots and fails at all levels. To conclude, I am sure that many of these compa√±eras were not comfortable in a date with a twisted filmmaker, and that is why I question the authenticity of the film. Hi Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
