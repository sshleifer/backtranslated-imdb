Being a fan of silent films, I expected to see this image for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the movie seems to be a long, long, commercial for the Maxwell car. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene was about half the length you have, you may have enjoyed the movie more. But he grew very fast. And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in movies, without diminishing the enjoyment of the viewer, what happened to the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time moves at a mile per hour, but can not reach it?
