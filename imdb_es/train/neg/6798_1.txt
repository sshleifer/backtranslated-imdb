This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. Everyone involved should be ashamed. All the world. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely horrible and Hokie does not begin to describe the performances of each actor in this film. The plot steals a lot from the Executive Decision, but compared to Air Rage, the Executive Decision is the material of the Academy Award. I have never been so disappointed to see a movie. Air Rage must be burned with its ashes enclosed in a vault to never see the light of day again. Anyone who has seen it should shower and remove the smell of the horrible movie. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end, when the credits were shot. This was easily the worst movie I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must abide by Law and Order, and the other people in this film must retire early or commit suicide. Either way, you should never try to be in a movie again.
