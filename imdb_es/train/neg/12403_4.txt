ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and shows the direction in which it inevitably went. The characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were going to be front and center. The rest of the cast was also going to hit the clock and collect their checks. The series would return to the occasion and have its moments, but there had been a fatal decline. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner. The rest of the cast would be professional but each time they were given less to do. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, would continue with his character as if there was no learning curve. The reaction of ANDY to any situation was naive and incredible. Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "storm teapot" was the same, juvenile. <br /> <br /> In this film it is clearly illustrated. . ANDY gets into several incredible situations that with a simple explanation would have been solved. This screen writing device was known as the 'idiot diagram'. A means of stretching a badly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys fault than the Director and the Writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz had directed too many and a stronger hand was needed to control the excesses of Rooneys. To see our summary of the entire series, go to YOU ​​ONLY ONLY YOUNG PEOPLE (1937).
