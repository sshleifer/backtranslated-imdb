This remake of Tim Burton's original "Planet of the Apes" of 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly, special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was horrible. I sat through the whole movie with a friend (who fortunately only rented it) and I completely understood why, before Christmas, all the toys from Planet of the Apes at Target were in the dumpster. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: do not put this on your résumé. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: see the original 1968 film "Planet of the Apes".
