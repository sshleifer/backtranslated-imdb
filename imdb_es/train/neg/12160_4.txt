I came across this movie on a rainy Sunday, with the intention of tuning in to something else. Out of curiosity, I agreed to the comments here, and I found myself looking at it until the end. I really did not do it with intention, this was one of those movies in which you are "fascinated", and you watch it for "a couple more minutes", until you finally look to the end. And the accusation of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to watch. The only comment in which the person really liked seems to be solely as a result of the taste for Ladd and Spano, and their previous roles. But the good thing is that you can not find any place anywhere here: history, performances and, in particular, the absurd events of the court. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr exceeded the 300 pound mark), and Ben Matlock, are given some room for maneuver around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of participating in exhibitions often by going to the jury and showing them, even before the judge and prosecutor have been informed or shown them. No judge or prosecutor of real life would accept this. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost always finished the process by squeezing a confession from the real killer. Actually, Perry almost always did this, but often Matlock simply presented overwhelming evidence of the real culprit, considered it a "reasonable doubt" and let the cops and prosecutors proceed against the guilty party, sometimes in the camera, sometimes presumed . at the end of the program. <br /> <br /> But that being said, Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of room for maneuver they gave him, in the courtroom part of this story, made Matlock / Mason's actions more similar to the Slow, often boring details, like those seen on Court TV and in real-life halls. <br /> <br /> All the characters in this presentation were insipid, unfriendly, obnoxious, bored, unlikely, or a combination of two or more. of these. <br /> <br /> The ending was the most banal, absurd and even silly conclusion possible, but again, fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. The films would appear at their best: probably the best in the roles of 2a. advantage (probably better if "3ra-"), even in this place. Taylor could be chosen as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story / performances, and 3 extra for the fascination factor.
