Honey's franchise, I Shrunk the Kids was a big business, not to mention it was very famous. I loved Honey, I crushed the children when I was little. It was an original story and it had such an exciting plot! The sets were incredible and the cast seemed to enjoy each other's company. Now, baby, I thought the boy was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is now a little more adult and the mom is going. on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite object is threatened by garbage, he wants to reduce it and save it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some medicine to their son, they are also trapped in the machine, leaving the children alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The plot is silly, but as I said, it was just a family movie that I think some might like. The original honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend this movie at least for Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
