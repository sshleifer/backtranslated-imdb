This silly comedy really does a good job of losing comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused here. I may have laughed once or twice during this movie, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a bit of stupidity just in case. The premise, although routine, was still not bad, but once the plot was established, the movie did not get anywhere. Do not waste your time with this power-up error.
