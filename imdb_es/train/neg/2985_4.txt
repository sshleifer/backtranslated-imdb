When I finally had the chance to see Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on an important DVD of Region 2, I was surprised at how entertaining this zombie epic is. The transfer is almost immaculate, as good as I'll always see unless Anchor Bay gets it. The gore really stands out as it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx. The sound is also fantastic. It's just a 2-channel channel, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate the cheesy music (actually it's a very good rating) and the effective but inexpensive sound effects. It never sounded so good, and the excellent transfer adds to the general enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flows in this movie, it's extremely brutal with explosive head shots, mega grains full of explosive puss, a blade to the throat of zombies, burned limbs of a woman (why did not she burn the boy too?)), intestinal chewing, zombie babies and much more i lost track. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly for fans of Zombie hardcore action, especially the Italian type. There are some excellent pieces and cinematography, I think people do not give enough credit, If you see a clean copy, and not a horrible copy of pirate, it is a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie never stops for a second, and I realize that it is inconsistent in the plot, the dubbing is horrible, the acting is rigid, and its sense of irreverence is celebrated grandly, but that is part of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the best horror films that have been made, you can not make a film this bad, very well, on purpose. It is an accidental genius of the highest order. If they played it to laugh, it would have been a disaster, but they played it like an arrow and the result is an incredible cult classic that says: Discover each and every one of the traditional norms of movie making. <br /> <br /> Tons of action sequences, exotic locations, excellent stage design, good, sometimes gr In cinematography, a wonderfully cheesy performance and an inconsistent but still interesting plot, excellent makeup effects, beautiful women They can kick ass, excellent music and, sometimes, fun, sometimes spooky, but always entertaining zombies. How can you make a mistake with this movie? It has everything, a cult classic that stands the test of time.
