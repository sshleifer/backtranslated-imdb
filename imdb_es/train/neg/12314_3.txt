Maybe I'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and old Funny Bone completely. Surely there must be something wrong with this Irishman (that's me, Schultz!). Lordy, lordy what I would give to see the light! First, the manic energy, ingenuity, and drive of Phil Silvers were a very important part of comedic education and general education in life, so to speak. Although it is possible that the series, titled for the first time: "NEVER ARRIVE RICH" (1955-59 *), could have entered the CBS television network with someone else in the main role of Sgt. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine any other Actor / Comedian in the business wearing those Sergeant Major stripes. <br /> <br /> Such a strong identification is inescapable, although it is not the same kind of pigeonholing that destroys the career of a nightmare that turned out to be for other guys, like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> A major obstacle to successfully adapting and updating a work of this kind from the 1950s television screen to the public that is directed to the 1990 film is our collective memory. Not sure what percentage of the crowd remembered that Bilko's character had seen the original race and the first revivals of syndication, and their number was certainly considerable; Even a large segment of the youngsters had seen reruns of Bilko in recent times. It was obvious that the new movie and the source were miles; or even light years apart. <br /> <br /> So that you do not think it's a totally square and old case, please consider other points. <br /> <br /> Right here, on November 14, in The Year of Our Lord 2007, allow me to swear and affirm under oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for almost 30 years. In addition, I have enjoyed the ingenuity and talents of Bilko '96 co-stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartman. After all, it was the talents of guys like this and many others, Alumni from "NBC; s Saturday NIGHT" and "SECOND CITY TV" that kept the last quarter of the 20th century at bay. But a new version of BILKO; he just did not click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the movie had been made as a service comedy (I always liked it!) but without the names of Bilko Show and gave it some identity of its own, it would be more well regarded by people Moody, old like me. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we have already had many series of comedy and cartoons turned into movies lately, what's next? What about someone doing the series of sergeants DOBLEDAY & AMES of the WWII comedy of the Second World War by Hal Roach and the first cartoon series of television "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you heard it first! POODLE SCHNITZ!
