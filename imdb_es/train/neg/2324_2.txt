I agree with the comments of other users in the sense that the two main roles were well interpreted, being that the guy who played the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. When he did not listen to the story, he did not know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so he did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong it was. The whole movie just talked, talked and talked about their parents. The only great scenes were the flashbacks where the father would lose his calm. That was the only interest I got from this borefest.
