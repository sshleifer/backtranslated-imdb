I see that a lot of people liked this movie. For me, this was a movie made with the right to write 101 and the person failed the class. From the moment that Lindsey Price, the cameraman appears until the end, the film was very predictable. I kept looking to see if I was going anywhere. <br /> <br /> First we have the young father widower. Films / TV cliché # 1 always kill the father mother if the child is a girl or a litter of children so that the single father can faint over his dead wife and appear completely out of his element taking care of the children. From My 3 children to 2 1/2 parents. These films are usually dramas and comedies are television programs. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When an aggressive woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play an important role in the film. And always have solutions or even if that person is an airhead. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is a foreigner, it must be of Latin origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Latinos or illegal Europeans, unless there is an IRA element involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 The Latin saying should be highly educated in your native country. In this case, he was a professor who did 200 per month. And the highly educated Latin saying should now act as if it did not have a mental head now and let the side kick of the airhead take over. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime that the person actually committed was not a problem. crime but an accident. But because in this case he lost all the sense he had when he crossed the border, now he acts like an idiot and now puts his own daughter in danger by leading her to an unsuccessful search to the border with the idiot side. kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 One never runs over a bully escaping from a crime, but some poor, cute child. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the movie, and because the person who killed the child may accidentally have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Nominate Me One Movie in which a cop is not the angry veteran and they are paired with a newbie. Even if they are homicide detectives they have to be the most experienced policemen in a police force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind immediately. And the vet, although brusque on the outside has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 8 Let's go get some unemployed Soap Stars together. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell can not act out of a paper bag and when she used to be in One Life To Live as Marty, she swung from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It is used to get sick from the sea. She may be better anchored on the ground now, but she still can not act. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if it was not full of clichés. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But this was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to ruin the end. Oh, yes, I will because I feel it will be a bad service for humanity to let a person waste time and never look at this movie again. This is cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before, he had to see what was coming. The father even makes a silly mistake that runs from the cops at the end and is shot by the angry veteran, who is suddenly very upset. One would think that she thought the poor man was innocent throughout the movie and that she shot him by mistake. When she did not do it. Now for the girl that the father brought with him. Guess what's wrong with her? Time is over, she ends up living with the family whose son was killed by her father! Come on! Everyone knew that this was going to happen, because she is a replacement girl! That's why he did not go to live with Lindey Price's character. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult to me. Because there were many avenues, this movie could be explored and disappear, but chose to take the cliché. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the girl, who I thought was very good and Lindsey Price whose character was annoying, but she did what she could with it. My advice is to take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
