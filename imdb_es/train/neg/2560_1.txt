Well, I saw it last night and the only thing that did not make it completely terrible is that it was simple. There was no beating around the jungle that this child was the Anti-Christ. However, the movie was badly written. For example, they never explained how they caused the dentist's incident to be an "accident" or in the end how the policeman miraculously ended up in the house in time to save the child without even calling the police. The scenes of death were really bad and nothing entertaining. The child they chose to play the Anti-Christ was boring and they really could have chosen a better child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
