This was a boost for me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake as me. This movie is tedious, it is not convincing and in general it is boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered; I cringed at each scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some few appearances and is his usual disconnected self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like a batch of Hollywood movies; all the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with a pseudo-Irish accent. Odd. Anyway, when you see this on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
