First of all, there are some good things about this movie, but everything is clich√© material combined with a movie for teenagers. In the publicity of this film, which I have seen, a great emphasis was placed on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a bad actress, and it is not as good as people try to be (it is not that). That has something to do with the movie). And what about the look he gives everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, the acting ... Still, the writing is fine. You know who everything is throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what's going to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging from the plot, but next time I'll read the book to find it instead of seeing it.
