I'm surprised that this movie has such a high rating, although if I had to go with the typical rating scale, 71 is a cod so maybe it's fine, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except boringly slow and unrealistic . Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but this one seemed to be trying to do it, and yet the woman who was raped did not file charges because she did not want to be questioned in a court even though she would put the man who broke her arm He hit her and did not rape her for life, but she also protected the lawyer for whom she had feelings and her family, not just at random to people she did not even know. There were other similar problems with the movie that would have been fine if there was some kind of moral to be removed from the film, but the few moral questions about whether it was right to try to kill Kady before he did something illegal. it presented a bit of a side, since Kady ended up being just a bastard crazed by revenge, so surely the lawyer was justified to protect his family, as they wait for Kady to rape his daughter to be able to do something legally It would be a bit absurd. So now I just lost more of my life for this stupid movie, so, please, do not see it, so at least your life will not have a hip and that way my 2 1/2 hours or so have meant something.
