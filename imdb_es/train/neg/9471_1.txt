Do not get me wrong, I assumed that this movie would be stupid, I honestly did it, I gave it an incredibly low level to fulfill. The only reason I saw it was because there were a lot of girls going (a different story for a different time). When I started watching I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two terrible types, there's Freddy against Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit down to laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there's a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat did not create even a momentary interest in me. When I saw it for the first time, I not only got bored with no sense, but I felt that I had been raped in some way by the horribleness of that movie. Mike Myers is generally brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that changed the director / producers / writers / assailants was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character other than the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original nonsense (and I hate to use this word, but it does fit) to the original. The book was like an ice cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was as soft and hard to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a leprous prostitute.
