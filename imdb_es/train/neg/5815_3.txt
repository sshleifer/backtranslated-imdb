I really wanted to see this movie based on the previews and the press it received, but after seeing it I felt terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally extravagant movie mixed with a disturbing family reality type of Todd Solondz without Todd's brand of humor. The story goes on and each scene is worse than the previous one. Maybe I did not understand the point, but if this movie is an example of each girl's growing experience, I'm glad to be a man.
