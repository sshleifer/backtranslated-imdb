The murders in this movie are not so bad, but surely the movie is. It is even worse than that. It's not even worth the wear it could cause when you slip it into your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear on your shoulders when you take it from the DVD store, not to mention the money AND the time you spend renting and watching it. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It is beyond understanding how someone could say something positive about this movie. It was just a masochistic tendency of mine that stopped me from looking, which adds to the pressure of the group of my co-observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is horrible, the address even worse and the performance is simply negligible. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see this as a mime for your fun, I prefer to see it as a fair warning: Do not waste your time watching this garbage!
