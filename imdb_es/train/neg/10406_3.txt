Warning: this revision contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the writers of the first tremors are officially without ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for direct video rates. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very boring movie. Where the hell are the Graboids? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids during the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry in the series is supposed to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not an interesting character in the film, except the character of Billy Drago, who is given very few lines, very little to do and in the end very little screen time. What saved movies 2 and 3 was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. When there was no action on the screen, you could be sure that Burt Gummer would also be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this film, Gross plays Hiram Gummer, a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good, but that's as good as it looks. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was on the list with 101 minutes in length. Pretty good for direct to video. But after watching it, I'm sure this movie lasts about 15 minutes. There are long stretches of dialogue that are boring and do not promote any plot. Was there a rush to make this movie? I think not, you could have spent more time in the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I had reached a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with ... Trembling !!! How lucky I thought, pay for # 4 to get the # 1 for free. Well, after watching Tremors 4, I like to think that I paid for the original and got this free mess, I can not imagine paying a single cent for Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it's better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins it even exists. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins scores 3 out of 10.
