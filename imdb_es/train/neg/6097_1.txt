In 1985 I caught this thing (I can not even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a friend from high school whose hormones were out of control. I realized at the beginning that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a group of old men who hire some young people to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while, but even he got bored after 30 minutes. Remember: this was a CHILD OF HIGH SCHOOL! This was before nudity was so easy to get online and so on. We keep looking with the hope of something interesting or funny, but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original advertising campaign in which the studio admitted that this movie was crap. (A poster had a fictitious review that said: "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed talent and has actually made a career in the business. No budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
