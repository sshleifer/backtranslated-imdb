In the first 30 minutes of Tinseltown my finger wobbled on the remote control, ready to move to see something else. The premise of two writers, with little luck, living in a "boat" of self-storage space was slightly funny, but painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - The movie guy, who lives in the park and sleeps in a bathroom, offered me hope and I decided to give him a few more minutes. And then a little more until Kristy Swansons showed up as a film director and nymphomaniac on the limit, added a bit of flavor. His solid acting performance elevated his presence beyond the simple inclusion of a candy. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious low budget impacts on the film with poorly filmed scenes, stuttered rhythm and slapstick handling of certain moments Some of my favorite movies of all time have been low budget, since that Whithnail and I also deal with 2 guys with a dream, but with little luck. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the "Terrible movie" files and almost pushed it into the files of "It could have been a cult movie". I laughed out loud at some of the scenes related to Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the house of characters terribly clich√©, but still funny, rich but ruined, where the story unravels in its last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was great When the filmmakers did everything possible to translate this to celluloid, it just did not work and although I laughed out loud at some of the scenes and in a line, I think that the first 30 minutes dull my senses and my expectations. One grade, I would have laughed at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you're stuck in a novel coffee coaster, do not take it if you see it in a bargain bucket.
