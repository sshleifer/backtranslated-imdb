Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are only some complaints. - The writer eliminated two main characters from the book. - The plot has been altered grotesquely. - The voices in off sound as if they had been taken directly from written passages (which can be read well but are not the same when spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The performance is more of wood than a log cabin. (Eng. Bechstein) - Is this supposed to be established in 1983? It feels more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not finish watching this movie, so it's possible that it could be exchanged ... (sarcasm). I sincerely hope that nobody pays to see this, or at least someone who reads the book expecting something decent (to the Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but I should be ASTONISHED of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> There are no stars.
