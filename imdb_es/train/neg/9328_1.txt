Lucky me! I had a preview of this pathetic "horror" movie by Artisan Entertainment a week before it hit the video shelves and let me tell you that I've rarely laughed as much in my life as I did watching. this atrocious megabomb flies and steals the title of "the worst killer clown movie ever made" from the unbearable stupid full moon fiasco KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us, the horror fanatics, have suffered through This!) Of all the indications, it was filmed in DV, and in fact it does not 'look' so bad in terms of digital quality, but it never fails miserably in all the other areas where it counts! <br /> <br /> The story (mild and clich√© as it is) goes as follows ... An executive (Ken Hebert, who also wrote and co-produced with the director) takes the skeptical workmate Tracy (Amanda Watson) and the couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) on a weekend getaway to a secluded cabin (yawn) "12 miles" from the nearest town. On the way, they pick up a bitch / bitch hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) in a bar and end up at their destination where a bonfire night about a killer clown lurking the same wooded area becomes a reality when each of the profanity-yackin Friends of Pot-Smokin ?? disappear one by one, and only parts of dolls are mutilated to tell the story of their destinies. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the movie until near the end and it does not look at all like the demonic representation of it in the video box (apart from being morbidly obese). Basically, he spends an hour wandering through the woods, chopping wood and bellowing nursery rhymes. I can not say enough about the cast, especially the two boys and the hitchhiker's girl, who offer their insipid dialogue with a minimum of enthusiasm or exaggerate at the most inappropriate times. It really does not help that the script lacks total and absolutely suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could continue for days about how inept this film is, how many continuity errors there are, and how fond of all the production is, but I fall asleep pointing out that the whole package is an uproar at Boy-This-Chupa something like that. <br /> <br /> He also points out that the movie has premiered here in the United States as SICK (Crazy Assassin Crazy Killer). It is currently cataloged under its (original title) GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 of 10
