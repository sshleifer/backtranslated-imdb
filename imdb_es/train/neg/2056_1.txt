Who loves the two classic novels of Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed with this movie. All magic and romance have been modernized from their original story of a girl doing a good deed for a mysterious old woman, and they have been given "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three trips in the 1800s in a dilapidated elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second one is All in Good Time.
