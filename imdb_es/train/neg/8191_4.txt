"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming "Santa Claus" this year at least having moments a little more fun than the star of Tim Allen, but that does not mean it's enough to make it worth a trip to theater. <br /> <br /> As the holiday movies go, it's artificial and sentimental. But in reality, that could be the least concern of one such as "Fred Claus", boasting of having David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights", "The Wedding Crashers") at the head, he hardly has a genuinely funny moment, who stumbles on the line between a Vince Vaughn vehicle and a blurred Christmas movie. In the end, it does not amount to much of both. And with a cast that includes Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, all the more leaves one disappointed. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, the older brother and separated from Nick (Giamatti), who once upon a time, left him and his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough to endure the favoritism of their parents towards their younger brother. Nick grows up and becomes Santa Claus (and, as the voiceover says, time freezes for you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a representative of Yuletide in Chicago, to whom He has a hard time remembering his girlfriend. The birthday of Wanda (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He gets into trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who seems oddly at least a decade older than him) to get him out of jail. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help in the toy-wrapping business at the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism clashes with the perpetually cheerful nature of Santa and the elves, even when an efficiency expert (Spacey) is reviewing the toy factory's operations, very happy that all operations in the Arctic are close if things fail. /> <br /> The film, as it was said, has its moments, but the padded length of the race stretches them thin throughout its duration. In the middle there are lots of clich√©s of Christmas movies that were handled better in, for example, "Elf" and the attempts of sentimentality are as attractive as last year's fruitcake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, causes his harsh charm at the table, but Dan Fogelman's castrated writing REALLY prevents him from doing his thing. Giamatti, under the fat suit, brings a very old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, he has to be the second violin for Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end up as unusually bland. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable movie that falls short of what those involved deserve. Sure, there are worse ways to start the season at the movies, but there are much better ways.
