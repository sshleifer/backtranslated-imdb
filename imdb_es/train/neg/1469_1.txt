Just like watching the home movies of a neighbor's summer camps, "Indian Summer" is a bore that induces sleep. There are barely eight campers of ex-students, when incredibly boring flashbacks begin to appear for characters we know nothing about. The good actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this movie. A camper's observation that "everything looks a lot smaller than I remember" repeats itself at least ten times, enough to make it writhe. The anticipated jokes are neither fun nor original, unless you think that the short sheets are a real "howler". This movie was a big disappointment considering the broad talent involved. The "Indian summer" did not make me feel nostalgic, only sick. - MERK
