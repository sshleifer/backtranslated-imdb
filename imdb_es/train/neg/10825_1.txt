What made the idea of ​​seeing this film so appealing was the hope that it would live up to the brilliance of Charlotte Bronte's original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to discover that this film, which seemed to be written or shot in a hurry, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the ingenious back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be missing in the script or left on the floor of the cutting room. She also lacked Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which allowed her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over everyone. The original Jane Eyre was a heroine. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph, including one of the best parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. His struggle to find food and shelter, his shame about having to beg for bread, the threat of dying frozen in the cold, everything to get away from a man he loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out. this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was not attractive and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story is the most interesting. The script and Direction did little or no credit to classical history.
