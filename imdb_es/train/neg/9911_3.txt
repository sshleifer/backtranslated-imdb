If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other distraction. The massive talent is totally wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", with the guilt of falling into the script. My neighbor's vacation films are as interesting as this wrong road movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran cast with a good script, see "The Crew." There are really no redemption factors here, and seeing these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the superficial script deceives the audience, essentially by not giving the actors anything to work with. - MERK
