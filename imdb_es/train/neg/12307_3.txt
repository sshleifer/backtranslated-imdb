When I say "Doctor Who", you can evoke an image of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison. When you say "James Bond" you will almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small group of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sergeant Bilko", absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs exclusively to an actor. And that is the problem with this film version that you would like to see the old black and white show continuously. In fact, the whole idea of ​​making a film version of BILKO without Platerías in the main role is close to sacrifice.
