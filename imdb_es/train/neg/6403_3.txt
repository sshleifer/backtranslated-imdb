... in terms of the level of ingenuity in which this comedy operates. Almost without reaching the length of the show, "I can do it ... 'Until I need glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe it when you realize that ESA was supposed to be the key phrase (example: Santa's gag); others are so long that you can not believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that launch line (example: the student awards gag). And almost all are directed without any art. Do not get me wrong: about 1 in 10 jokes actually manages to be fun (the iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful frontal nudity that demonstrates, once again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also some comic male nudity). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is really very catchy! But none of those reasons is enough to give this film anything more than * of 4.
