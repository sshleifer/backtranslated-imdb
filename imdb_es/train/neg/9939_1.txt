The intellects of the film school can drool all they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: the intellectual slime. This movie is creatively bankrupt, and some mistake is an endless self-indulgent masturbation as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because this could have been great. He is capturing the birth of this timeless song and, instead, chooses to cover the music with a guy who is reading a True Detective magazine or something like that. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of what look like the librarians of the 60s spray-painting the words of people's cars. And then there's the seemingly endless "interview" where the actress received a brilliant instruction to answer only yes or no to all really deep and intellectual questions. There's a guy in a purple suit who's reading more trash than a book, which only lasts about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a junkyard. <br /> <br /> Does it almost sound intriguing? Well, it is not. <br /> <br /> But for the film school hipsters who have not been washed and who do not care about missed opportunities to have full access to the Stones that bring Sympathy for the Devil to the world and prefer to hear something In instead of that, an English guy who reads while watching the covers of nudie mag's, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard simply explodes.
