I can say categorically and unequivocally that in all my 51 years on this planet it is the worst (supposedly childish) movie I have seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren to see her and they were even struggling to raise a smile during the torturous 90 minutes. I'll leave the sexual recipes for another day, but they were as insipid as the movie. They must pay you to look at them, not you pay them. It's really horrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this movie should be taken to the task for taking money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Apologize for my spelling mistakes, but I'm so upset that it ruined the time I had with my grandchildren Regards, Stephen
