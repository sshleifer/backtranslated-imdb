Contrary to most of the other comments about "Syriana" on the IMDb website, my family and I discovered that watching this movie on DVD at home was a complete waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a movie based on a script whose writer was too smart. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in a clever and clear way, it was assumed that he constantly tossed vague and difficult-to-connect vignettes of 30 seconds of different stories from a dozen "story lines" in The audience made a great and clear visualization. No, sir, he does not. What makes a great visualization is the total clarity, the precision, the arguments and the lines of the story, and the characterizations, which have a beginning, a middle and an end. <br /> <br /> This type of film presentation, similar to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant is extremely pretentious and unintelligent. <br /> <br /> Thank God, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the British and Hollywood film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director and actors knew the value of storytelling clear, dictions and act that meant something. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that this family will not see again.
