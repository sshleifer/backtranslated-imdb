I had high expectations after "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The stories of British Asians who adapt to their adoptive home have had many good careers on the big screen, as well as a series of excellent radio and television series (Goodness gracious, etc). This falls flat. Despite a good start, it quickly went downhill. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it was a horribly typical effort by the BBC, complete with strong regional accents, crazy overacting characters, a soundtrack of "those were the days", and many "problems" in a attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I found myself shrinking at many points during this movie. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliché was dragged and aerated. In fact, I have trouble thinking about any intercultural / intergenerational device that might have been used that was not used. The characters were thin and cliché: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well-intentioned but, ultimately, racist old lady; overweight, the dominant aunt; the aggressive Indian parents; the neighbor of the working class; the deep grandmother 'wise'; The bike riding a thug. The script was weak, with all the possibilities of surprising the audience with an open and racist dialogue of the two dimensional racist white characters taken. And why he had to settle down in the 70s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it makes incredible characters a little more believable for people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Even with these things, good acting could have taken this to respectable darkness. Instead, the usual suspects of the "BBC comedy" were expelled to ruin it. "Bend it like Beckham" had a much better comic performance (and a serious performance, in fact) than this, with an almost unknown cast. <br /> <br /> In short, a lazy script cliched, over acted, in a boring, predictable story. Give him an oportunity. <br /> <br />
