This was so lame that I turned off the DVD ... maybe in the middle. He was so weak that he could not even pay enough attention to tell you how far he had made it. Although I really wanted to believe that young Carlito's description would be something different, I just could not buy it. I do not really blame the actors, because I think it was the script that could have fallen. I found myself laughing a few times, but I do not think those lines were meant to be fun. <br /> <br /> It's just to save me, it's that I bought it on a set of 2 DVDs and I would have paid. The price I made for the original only. This is one of those cases in which they should have left the classic solo.
