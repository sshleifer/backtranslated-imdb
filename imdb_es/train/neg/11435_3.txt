I wish I had known more about this movie when I rented it. I put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong credibility as an actress (IMHO). While some parts of the film were charming, much of the film felt artificial, underdeveloped or, otherwise, boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people who think the sibs were a couple ... I do not care how big the part of the story is, it still feels a little, um, disgusting. And Charlie, for a zoologist, certainly does not seem to be very in tune with the signals of other Homo sapiens. What made Gray fall in love with her (in addition to his warmth and some common interests)? The story could have been much more interesting with a little more depth. Highlights: Molly Shannon (although I agree with the critic who found her upset on occasion), the taxi driver in motion and the dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such good dancers, I wish we had seen more of that, since that the bits they showed us were, in fact, better than most of the rest of the movie). It could have been better.
