This has been published in the DVD market by Alpha, and is only for Boris Karloff fans (like moi). It is not a horror film, but a drama in which Boris is a scientist who struggles to kill the husband of a wealthy woman to earn the fortune necessary to continue with his work. But once the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his spouse, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It's nice enough to see Karloff as another selfish and sinister guy, and part of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially on the part of La protagonista, Mona Goya, which is absolutely a racket of laughter as the wife of the double crusade). <br /> <br /> But proceed with great caution.
