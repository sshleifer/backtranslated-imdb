I was not entirely sure what to expect from a genre of comedy, drama, fantasy and science fiction, but, given the actors involved, I thought I'd give it a spin. The tone of the film felt uncomfortable, going through patches of each of the genres, but it never felt so balanced, so I finally stopped trying, and I focused on the cinematography and the individual performances, which in my opinion were good in general, considering each character. it had little depth due to the nature of the story (I will not reveal anything here). I have to say that he felt much more than his execution time of 96 minutes, and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for a close, a bit of satisfaction, but it did not turn out to be the smart or clever piece I expected it to be. I think Tony mistakenly thought that what he did at the end of the movie gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. Ultimately, I feel cheated. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave it standing without the "end" as a piece of art ... alone. Or ... I may have missed the point completely :)
