This third Pok√©mon movie is too abstract to be followed by younger children and too repetitive to entertain older children. The message of the film, about how to deal with the loss, is subverted by the return of the girl's father during the credits of the movie. The Rocket Team provides some fun, but they are not really part of the small plot, so they do not appear very often.
