I've seen four other Japanese horror films and they were not that impressive. However, I could feel that there was a sensible script that led the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, in any way. This is a detective who is trying to relate similar murders that have been happening. When he finds a suspect to interrogate him, the suspect gets scared because they still see a ghost. Then, the ghost begins to follow the detective for A REASON THAT NEVER EXPLAINS AND INCREASES MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad? Oh no. The film continues to change perspective to different characters that do not have much to do with history. I've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. It is not the case here. <br /> <br /> In addition, everything that happens on the screen that is really tolerable ends quickly. For example, there are some scenes with a slight instrumental score that accumulates and ... then it is reduced to another scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. That is definitely not the intention here. It is simply a bad edition. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "ghost" who simply screams in a way that is not terrifying or meaningless. It is annoying and happens a lot throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All the fears have been made before a better way so you can see them coming. Then, after one of them, the movie is over. At that moment, a wave of confusion invaded the audience, as he could feel that we all felt we had lost time. Someone gave a mocking slap and there was a laugh. It was better than the whole movie. In short, AVOID.
