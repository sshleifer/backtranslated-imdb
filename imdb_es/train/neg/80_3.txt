I must say that I am really surprised by the high ratings of this film. It seemed absolutely idiotic to me. Does the mother have "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing he touched twice made his vision continue ... It just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was horrible, I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did the majority of the support cast for what they had to work on. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and I'm very open when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and an exaggerated performance and it just was not for me.
