... mainly because Ju-on 2 has a scandalous forty-minute material literally taken from the first Ju-on, and when you consider that the sequel only lasts 76 minutes, that leaves you with 36 original minutes. Value of the movie. Ho-hum. I found it deeply irritating, as if the spectators simply did not remember the same thing! - not to mention boring, having to see everything again. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside that complaint, the phrase for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain many of the unanswered questions of the first movie, which frankly, over 36 minutes, simply did not It is enough to understand the complicated and original plot of the original. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some really cool new horror sequences that show how good the movie could have been, if it had had some time to develop; and some of the questions posed by the original (some, but not all) are answered. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you loved the first original movie and want to see some additional developments about the story, go for it, but remember to keep your remote control on hand with your finger on the fast forward button during forty minutes.
