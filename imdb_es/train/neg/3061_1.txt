This movie is horrible. Give me the dentist at any time! Can you believe that one of the main television stations here in Arabia had this as their Christmas movie? I can only assume that they expected to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore instead. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle had more action, better plot, more drama and much more interest than this waste of celluloid. Do not even look at it if you're drunk!
