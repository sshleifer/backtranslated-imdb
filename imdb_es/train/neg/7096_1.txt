It's amazing because it manages to be terrible on many levels. The script, the acting, the direction and the choice of the cast are terrible. The costumes, the sets and the pseudo-medieval language are also absolutely horrible. In a strange way, I really enjoyed this movie, once I accepted that it was not going to be any good. It seems a pity that people devote so much time and effort to producing something so poor, when they really could have done something decent enough of the premise (although not very credible!), But instead, they treat us in a rather nauseating way and corny. tale of dragons and knights, which lacks the charm found in other similar fantasy movies. Let's hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. He does it!
