To overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what any person in his position would do naturally (at least in a Peter Greenaway film): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half women (one does not have legs) women and embark on a sexual odyssey. This being a Greenaway movie, there is a lot of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and, of course, there is an unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and the son share a bed sleeping naked. Stupid. Also, who wants to see an old man full face? For those who are not in the homoerotic scene, one of the women likes to do unpleasant things with horses. There is no story, just a random collection of boring scenes.
