There are movies that are horrible, and there are movies that are so terrible that they are considered forgotten and forgotten for a long time. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just cheesy things, you know what I mean) are also added to the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such high-pitched content? Why, "Final Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Do you remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the protagonist of that film, and Joel and the Bots repeated it in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place in the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), that trio made fun of MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie, "Final Justice." Of course, a lot of the bad things that I mentioned were eliminated for the television release, but still, I want to see that episode (and "Mitchell" too), because what does Joe Don hate the most? Well, nothing less than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a large lot nearby, look in the shop for the uncut ribbon! LOL That happened to another user!
