I do not know why I take the time to review this time-wasting movie. If you continue with enough time in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? Good, bad, or surprising? do not do it Finally it fades after a dialogue and a rigid, formulated and predictable action. The interior scenes are so illuminated that, if the camera moved one millimeter further, I would see the Klieg lights. The costumes, hairstyles and sets are starched, pressed and immaculate. Are we supposed to imagine that ordinary people really lived like this in the early 20th century in Arizona? Comparisons of other reviews with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least that director introduced his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. The gore of HARD MEN is a free explosion of squibs of wooden imitations of bad guys with well-manicured nails. Huh?!? I can believe that Heston thought he could have been doing something of value with this movie. (He manages to grab his weapon with his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he signed up for this farce. Do you want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of the Westerners as we knew it? Look at THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of an obituary to the west.
