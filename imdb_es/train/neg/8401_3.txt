Having seen this on TMC, it is fresh in my mind. It is obvious that, although the puppets are prominent stars, they do not really execute the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups: Moe, such as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagabonds, so there is not much team work. The love story that feeds the plot is not interesting, the two ladies are the only ones with some ability to act, there is another group of musical henchmen that are not comfortable, unless you consider that their attempts to be funny are sadly absurd. The music is boring, they drive cars to the ranch and then they depend on the horses, the dorky western clothes are silly, and there are a lot of movies without photographers in the camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first hit, and his reduced level of energy is clear. Vernon Dent appears from the beginning in an uncredited paper. I loved everything these guys did, including everything that is not Curley, but this little puppy is pretty bad.
