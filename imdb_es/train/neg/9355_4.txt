Only recently have I been able to catch up with Marilyn Miller's films since they have not shown up at TCM in the UK. I've been intrigued a lot over the years because I was one of the 20's superstars. How was it really? For some stars of this era like Jolson, some of the magic still shines, but unfortunately not for Miller. Her dance seems awkward and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited and as an actress makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. Worse. this movie, since the public had tired of the musicals, practically all the musical numbers had been eliminated. So we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal. He was being paid $ 500,000 for this! So I only have two conclusions. Either the cinema did not serve her well or she did not have any talent. I think the truth is closer than the previous one.
