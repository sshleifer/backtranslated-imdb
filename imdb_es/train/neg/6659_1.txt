For the first 3 seasons, Fairly Odd parents were as tasty as hard candy, bright, sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you'll need after seeing the most recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that have not made you laugh. Cosmo, who was once one of Nick's most attractive characters, has become an abusive and abusive cretin that the Family Guy cast would not even want to know. Timmy has become an arrogant and selfish imbecile that Bart Simpson would cheerfully remove (and given Timmy's discomfort, that would require many blows). And poor Wanda ... a real delight who has become a victim of her husband and godson, is now labeled "a complaint" for worrying about the welfare of others. In addition, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but never punish him or learn any lessons. Which pretty well sums up Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they're coarse, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God, this miserable friend has been canceled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved, unlike Cosmo.
