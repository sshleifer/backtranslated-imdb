I love a good war movie and I enter the category "I've been there, I did that". So I would like to think that my review is accurate (IMHO). Having seen this movie on DVD, I can safely say that it was a lot of garbage. There's no way I can recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> It started when I shouted at the TV saying "you would not do that", etc. But soon I realized that I have a little time. Work experience would be an obstacle, so I've cooled down a bit. But in the initial scene when the trailer wheel fell, I had the unpleasant feeling that this movie would be a predictable mistake ... He was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic in the EOD scenes. I only know that the army team had some of the more patient insurgents at the other end of the command line or remote trigger. So much so that they left me scratching my head all the time. So, just when you think you know where the story is going, the guys in the Humvee are going through the desert. One of the most valuable assets in the theater in a joyful stumble with some aspiring SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was very laughable. It just did not make any sense and it made me want to disconnect there. Then, to extend it for so long really proved my patience. It started with the "Right Contact" and it went downhill quickly. If you had a British accent, you would get a shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, suddenly you were a great shooter and you saved the day. Then, just when you thought it was finished, it went on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story. You just keep looking and asking why is not it over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the alcohol scene where they hit each other to laugh ... another scene where you just wanted it to end. He did not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, when my life seemed very boring, the main star left the cable to hunt someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. He defied all logic and ability to write a good story ... it was absurd and horrible. I still do not understand why they wasted their time on it. Then, seeing him just run down the busy streets that returned to the camp, he rolled me on the ground with laughter. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story is in the whole program without really deciding what you want to be. I thought they were going to be stupid illogical scenes of EOD, but then tangents were being fired trying to be something different. But as much as he tried, he bored me to death. All he wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed in a lot of stupid and senseless action scenes (ish). <br /> <br /> There is no way I can recommend it. Maybe my work experience compromised the fun, but even the naive should realize that this simply does not make sense. The only thing more stupid than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... that should be the 24/7 work of the PR team at the box office that seems to use this website as a way to make everyone think it's good . Sorry people ... it just is not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will simply bore you.
