The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not the one she had to tackle on the screen. <br /> <br /> Rather, the mystery is why this perennial disappointment is still in the air. This week marked a high point for Veronica Mars: it stood at 146 of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read it right. Veronica Mars was defeated by all the WB shows, now disappeared, and by all shows at UPN. It was surpassed by all the shows on Fox and, of course, by all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now, the hypesters will say: but this was a repetition. But everything on TV that week was almost a repeat! It amazes me why CW would choose this proven rating disappointment as one of the few programs it saved from UPN. <br /> <br /> It is clear that something is happening behind the scenes. Favors are being exchanged and influences sold. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead now that it has had two years to establish itself and it did not. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the influence and influence of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm lost. why someone would choose to spend their influence on a bad show that the audience does not see. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a very unlikely debut for CW.
