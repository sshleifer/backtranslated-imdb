This was not the worst movie I have seen in my life, but that is all that can be said about it. Start with a good atmosphere; The hospital is properly sterile and alienating, the mood is set to "mysterious". And then ... nothing. Well, some things. Only a few things that clearly do not fit ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the strange bugs and, however, not particularly intimidating, and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker bikers? Some bands saw Gwar too much. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the main demon, which looks a lot like a middle-aged truck driver desperately trying a threat, while at the same time he seems to really like to lie on a covered couch. Afghans, unbuckle their belts, open a cheap beer can (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen much more frightening truckers. At truck stops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more cartoonish, and even less scary. At least, in the DVD, the videos give an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... apparently appear randomly in places, play a little "metal" and cause people to die a little. Except for some good special effects, and acting that is not all terrible given the lack of decent writing, there is simply nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
