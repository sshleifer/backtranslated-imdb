(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, in addition to a very interesting topic: invisibility. All the premises for a great movie were fulfilled. Unfortunately, these things did not matter at all. The movie was very, very suspense and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> This is a group of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the animal tests were successful, Kevin Bacon decides to try it on himself. Once it is invisible, it changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. He suffers from the disease that many new movies have: special effects. From a challenging theme that could have led producers to a great psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything by focusing only on special effects, regardless of the real value of the film. I must admit that the special effects are incredible, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. Actually, that's the problem with today's movies. Like Verhoeven, most directors only care about the spectacular scenes, and nothing else. The exceptions are very few, and probably Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines fabulous special effects and a great plot. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. Instead of a great movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not ruin this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, then, What went wrong with the movie? All. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It is not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - Many clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the bad boy wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As with any low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is someone alone in the laboratory, perfect victim for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the laboratory. After he is invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon on the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. That is normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, "kills" him again. And then Shue shouts "I heard an explosion" (it happened a few minutes ago), and suddenly they come running. Did not you hear that explosion a little earlier? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So that's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
