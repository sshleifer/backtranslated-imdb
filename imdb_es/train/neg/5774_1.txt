This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this movie. Getting on the bus, although apparently anti-racist, only rebukes the whites and degrade the black status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men who travel in a bus to the march of the million men of Louis Farrakhan. The bus has all the types of people you can imagine: gay, Muslim, gang member and Uncle Tom (although he is expelled from the bus). There was a single white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist at the time he got on the bus to drive. Even though he was a Jew and the fact that he explained it is a situation that ended up being racist and he left the bus. I hate to say it, but movies like this need to realize their own hypocrisy and reluctance of stereotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph but as a sad disappointment. You may think that I am a racist for writing this but I mean it well. Better luck next time Spike.
