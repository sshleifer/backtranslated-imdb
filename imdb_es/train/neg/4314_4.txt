I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Presenter Steve Martin was at his best: "I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore in the trunk of his limousine "and" I better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with the head of a poodle in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Amazing winners: Nobody had Adrien Brody as the best actor (Genuine applause) or Roman Polanski for the best director (genuine boos and boos) but they won <br /> <br /> The award ceremony last year was not so bad, but there were few surprises and I was happy see RETURN OF THE KING swept the awards, even if it was not the best in the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what left the coverage of the BBC was that Jonathan Ross managed to get some of his fellow flatterers to do it and pretend that They were hilarious when they were something but. So when I heard that Sky was doing the coverage for British television, I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh, if British television is desperate for film critics (obviously they are), I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will fly to Los Angeles to express their honest opinions about winners and losers <br /> < Chris Rock was not that bad, but it's not Steve Martin, while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats installed! Not much of an ostentatious arena in my opinion. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "minor" Oscars given to the winners who were sitting in their seats. There is no such thing as a "minor" Oscar and just because the prize is for Best Animated Short Film or Best Costume, they are as deserved as Best Film or Best Director. All winners must be able to get on the podium. In what group of arrogant snobs the Academy is becoming and I totally agree with the comments that this format is shameful and, if it were not for the surprises, this could have been the worst ceremony in history. As for the awards themselves <br /> <br /> Best supporting actress - Cate Blanchett. It's not a big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Best supporting actor: Morgan Freeman. There are no real complaints since Freeman is one of the best actors of living characters in the United States. <br /> <br /> Best actor: Jamie Foxx. Most predictable prize of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best actress - Hilary Swank. Great surprise, since everyone believed that Annette Benning was going to simply win the politics of the academy, but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night. <br /> <br /> Better director: Clint Eastwood. Great surprise since everyone thought that Scorsese was going to receive the prize simply because he had never won one. Actually, I'm glad of this because if he did not deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he did not deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best movie: MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Once again, another big surprise, as everyone thought that the academy would divide the awards for the best director and best film, while the friendly Hollywood plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it the Best Film cert, while the controversial subject of MDB would have become a big issue. Voters off <br /> <br /> What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year voters have decided to ignore the Oscar policy and really award prizes to people who deserve something they have not done in the past, I want say A BEAUTIFUL MIND by beating THE RING COMMUNITY for God's sake! And as long as the academy votes with their heads instead of their hearts.
