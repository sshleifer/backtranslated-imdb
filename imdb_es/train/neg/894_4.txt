I just saw him yesterday at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. Just before going, I came here to see its classification, and at that time it was 7.4, a good rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to leave (I never did this), but I I felt embarrassed to do so since the producer of the film was in the projection. <br /> <br /> I did not like anything, the dialogues are superficial and do not lead anywhere, the characters are less deep than the dialogues, nothing to lead anywhere, and the worst and the worst: a lot of publicity of Siemens and Organics in the film. Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character who chat on the Internet and the Siemens mobile appears all the time on his laptop; or another character who bathes or cuts his hair so that the Organics shampoo is displayed enormously on the screen. All this would be bearable if the plot, the characters, the romances, anything was good, but it was bad, really bad! A "I do not know how to do" sex in the city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money.
