This movie should be called "plan 9 by joseph smith". I think its rarity is underestimated. The playwright seems to have read "The Demographic Bomb (1968)" by Paul Ehrlich, and created a musical response made especially for Mormons. The goal of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of the plan (the god) of the "heavenly father." and everything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad. Get it? <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. It's Utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the work was actually written in 1973 and, of course, theology is part of 1840, battlestar galactica part. part of the action takes place on earth and another part in the "pre-existence", an aimless mamluk room where the annoying children wait to retrieve their bodies so they can go down and try not to knock on the door to the missionaries, losing his shots to the celestial ones. glory. <br /> <br /> it's as staggered as they come, but do not let the poor theatricals ruin your appreciation for this insane Mormon universe in which 'great kids' control the population, (presumably) advice. Their parents do not have more children! Having large families was, at the time the work was written, the cultural norm in the children's community and, more importantly, it was considered part of God's plan. Since then, the church has made a 180, and they have made family planning a choice of parents, and large families are now far less the cultural norm. Make the complete doctrinal premise of the film for a modern Mormon debate! <br /> <br /> ahhh but in reality it is only as good as the music. There are some catchy tunes here that simply do not allow this film Death the death of the 70s for which it was predestined. brother and sister sing some love songs that make you wonder if maybe something else happened there - wink. and tough, cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica. Greetings to all that! Gather the family, make some jelly shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
