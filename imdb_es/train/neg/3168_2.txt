I had to turn this off after about 15 execrable moments .. <br /> <br /> I was hoping I could improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was misinterpreted, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This movie should never have been released directly to DVD ,. <br /> <br /> The main character who is a top bride of the HELL has a huge ice sculpture on it killing her. She was such a disgusting person that she did not even feel it for her. She meanders there in a kind of sky, and was still repulsive, I left soon after. <br /> <br /> Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope she never sees her again, can not even act. annoying. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, an actor who normally can not do anything wrong was also in this problem. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (who is no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies BUT not stupid ones about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (over 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
