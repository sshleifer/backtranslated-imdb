An extremely boring drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka title, and is the only reason to see the film in the first place. Covered with music at full volume, dominant and overwhelmed by Schmaltzy's dialogue, this is one of those endless films that bore you to the point of a persistent headache. The unnamed sequel, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is slightly better than the original, but the pace is still slow and the score continues to make you fall into submission, although there is At least One or two scenes that do not induce a comma.
