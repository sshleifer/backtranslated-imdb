I'm not going to say that this movie is horrible, because I've seen worse things, but it's not even half decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I really could not understand what was happening and where things were going. When the movie was over, they left me scratching my head. I looked until the end of the credits to see if they had anything behind them that could clarify things, but once the credits were over, that was it. I felt as if I had been shaken from one weak plot point to another throughout the entire film, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> The development of the character is very superficial. I could not understand when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not tell if half of the characters were supposed to be drunk, drugged, mentally ill or if they just had a bad actor to portray them. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (to your credit, they're hard to avoid using when you're making a movie about a singer in a rock band), which SHOULD facilitate the development of the character, since many other films have already illustrated the suffering of a battered child, or the evidence of a heroin addict trying to cleanse himself. Stereotypes are easy to describe, which would explain why so many bad movies tend to abuse stereotyped characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotyped characters to the left and to the right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be discarded without any explanation. I guess it's okay because we spent very little time developing characters that I really did not have the opportunity to meet any of them, so I never missed them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least was the sadie song. It is awful. The music that backs it is not the winner of the prize, but it is usually drowned out by the squeals that are released from Sadie's vocal cords. I swear there is a point in the movie where he sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought that I would have to turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is confusing. The characters are badly developed, Georgia's performance is hard and rigid, the character of Sadie is passed from one bad situation to another, without history or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can not think of good reasons to watch this movie unless I thirst for cinematic pain.
