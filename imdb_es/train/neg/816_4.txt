In the 1970s, WPIX published "The Adventures of Superman" every weekday afternoon for a few years. From time to time, we received a gift when they went ahead to the neighboring programs to broadcast "Superman and the Mole Men". I always waited for those days. Seeing it recently, I was surprised at how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad for the special effects, or the lack of them. It's true that the George Reeves Superman disguise was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make it look more imposing being clearly visible. And it is true, the suits of the mole men were even worse. What was supposed to be a furry cover would not have fooled a ten-year-old boy, since zippers, sleeve hems and poorly made pilling badly fitting fabric for baggy suits were painfully obvious. But these were forgivable failures. <br /> <br /> No, what made it wrong were the artificial raster devices. Again and again, Superman did nothing to prevent the situation from deteriorating. A lyncher is looking for the creatures? Instead of gathering the hysterical crowd or looking for the creatures for himself, he finds himself explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the public relations man. The creatures are cornered? Once again, he keeps looking and talking, but he does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the agitator of the city, shoots him? He tried to kill any reasonable person, but Superman frees the man again and again to cause more problems. Superman had plenty of opportunities to eliminate the problem, but he never took advantage of them. <br /> <br /> That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, apparently comfortable in the roles. . If only they had received a better script to work.
