I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I just saw. Mainly I think it's a movie about a "star" of S & M on the Internet of CD Roms that is as realistic as online cartoons. She was killed by someone, which causes her sister and a group of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA UU He is also investigating, although most of his work comes from the way of offending CD ROMs that he claims are as "real as real". I know. Wow <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie who has some kind of credits behind him. He's in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of that is he hits the main girl for no apparent reason. I'm not even going to explain the ending, because frankly I can not do it myself. But before the final scene, we received a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the movie. Honestly, they could have run that final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross-eyed direction and all. <br /> <br /> In general, stay away from this movie. I have it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used those 80 minutes on something else and been more satisfied. Like, play that game with a knife in which you repeatedly hit your hand. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
