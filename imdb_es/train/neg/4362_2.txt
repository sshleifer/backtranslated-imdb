A group of aliens with human appearance who go to Earth to eat land of shock on a planet of prehistoric beasts, instead of eating physedelic mushrooms and acting with delay. Filled with images of "The Planet of the Dinosaurs" and horrible jokes, this is definitely one that can not be missed. The acting is also atrocious, and while this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can it be?) This is still something disgusting enough horrible. The execution time of 90 minutes feels like an eternity and you're probably cursing life, so do yourself a big favor and continue, skip this fucking movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to resell this turd as an MST3K style by mocking the film they made a decade earlier, and it works to a certain extent. However, Ariauna Albright still can not be seen, but Lilith Stabs has a very unattractive voice. <br /> <br /> My grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: joke comment, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes in the black featurette; Jessica Mills informing; Gallery of stills; and original trailer
