Is this a stupid movie? You gamble !! I could not find any time in this movie that was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? Much. Stupid characters? You bet Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Oh well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheesed. He's the crying doctor I've seen. He has a man who is melting away running in Ventura County somewhere, he's not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she's 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds) and there's no cookies anywhere. In addition, he has in his hand the general, who is not very useful, and who wants to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters thrown to a large extent who meet the man who melts. Finally, the movie ends and the monster becomes a trash can to become compost. In the end, it's just what you need for a great episode of MST.
