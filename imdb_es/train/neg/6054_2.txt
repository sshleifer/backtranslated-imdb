I'm not sure if Carpenter is looking to ask questions about abortion, and to emphasize the obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father, but it goes on and on. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby looks really stupid, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can almost see the material of Satan's disguise. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of tedium. Very very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. After knowing that your baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody and bloody rampage? DO NOT! Just drop your head and get in a bad mood in the room. Terrible.
