Only the glandular secretions, and please do not ask for more details, of the young virgins can keep the body and mind in rapid deterioration from the wife of the old crazed, fresh and youthful amateur horticulturist. Since, like most people, except those who participate in medical trials, virgins rarely voluntarily renounce their secretions, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) is responsible for their being abducted and preserved. He will do the extraction by himself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball a premise for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a simple limburger leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Sure, the acting is almost horrible, except for the actors fortunate enough to play the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his brute from a crazed brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the hair of the virgins; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a stuffed coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> A young entrepreneurial reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet smell that the victims had used. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to spend the night, a storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us that a bit of furious violence is about to erupt inside her. As it is well known that in Hollywood at this time all single young women were virgins, it is possible that Pat has some unpleasant surprises with which to deal. They include dark passages, a crisp laboratory where an almost-dead virgin is stored, a mausoleum in the basement and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's glandular secretions. If she survives, what story will she have to give her editor. <br /> <br /> If you sample this wet slice of Velveeta moldy (and why not? Do not be superior), do not judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. It had a great impact on Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast is a sad and ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally brings a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts skinning the living man, well, it's a great scene.
