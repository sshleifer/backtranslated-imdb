What is the hardest movie ever made? The gynecological nightmare of 'Screams and Whispers'? The acid psychodramas of Fassbinder? The disconcerting black comedy of 'Last House on the left? I am sure that for that part of the audience that loves the movie that ties its masts to the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer: any of its sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what shocked my soul the most in this movie: the foundation of Keaton's intricate and expansive physical art to the slap; The painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with the dialogue: it is not that he does not have a charming and comical voice, or that he can not make the dialogue fun; it's just that the studio does not seem to have given him enough shots, and therefore he seems to be trying to remember his lines before delivering, which only makes Keaton, not his character, look foolish; Or is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton trapped in a farce of sex, when he has given us some of the richest stories of romantic frustration in a movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was more disturbing: having to see Buster Keaton, the best movie comedian, sit aside to watch Jimmy Durante doing his routine. Those horrors like this are what make Dantes compose your Infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have had the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to sound was to turn him into a Brother Marx, complete with verbal Pedantry, elaborate, tedious 'clowning', slapstick shambolic, theatrical setting, triumph through chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not that kind of comic book, and where Groucho's mischievous tongue and cheerful opportunism could have made this plot work, Buster's socially inept teacher can not, is too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to allow an experiment like Lang in 'M', or Rene Clair; he would never have tried to contain the tide as Chaplin. When referring to a movie like 'The General', which gets involved with trains, the loss becomes even more evident. <br /> <br /> And the thing is that, in patches in the middle of the flat direction, the film is not so bad: there is an excellent jolt when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at a train station; and the outcome, although it is not original, is at least more alive than the previous one. There is something almost captivating in the way that Keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zip it can get. <br /> <br /> Here is a film about loneliness, the emotionally paralyzing order, the numbing effects of education, etc., that are struggling to come out. The best way to appreciate this film is to see not the narrative of Professor TZ Post, but the genius Buster Keaton, trapped in a prison of mediocrity, confused by the new technology, mocked by a malevolent fate (in this case the study), Retaining a stoic grace. Seen in this way, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
