I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. Too predictable from a story line with the potential to be funny, but instead it falls flat on its face. Look, 19 words, however, I did not make a complete panorama of this movie with only one star, but I decided to upload it to two stars because Julie Bowen is smoking very hot and only gave me enough of the candy. The DVD leaves the machine and explodes with an M80. My advice: take the $ 4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and send it directly to me as a thank you for saving you time and the frustration of having to go through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the fare $ 50.00 replacement that you would be charged for removing your twelve meter to use this piece of junk as a practice of clay pigeon shooting.
