Bored, long, pretentious, repetitive, involved? This movement felt like a bad date. Worse still, the tedious direction of the art school, with excessive use of the rotating shot that is so exaggerated that it almost makes me vomit, it constantly screams to be noticed. Add the finest of the arguments and virtually no dialogue, and the movie will begin to look like a four-hour epic in about 30 minutes. Worse: instead of dialogue there are poorly written voices and quotes and songs that comment with clarity. the characters. The music of the opera really strong too. Blame the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good. The main actor, Miguel √Ångel Hoppe, is particularly suited to the stardom of the film. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. However, even these begin to get boring after 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a porn job in Bel Ami. The impressive architecture of the university campus as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. Why are universities in the United States so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD of this movie. Do you want to use the quick scan button? much.
