This film is made for the Asian / Chinese market, aimed especially at the fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest musical stars in Asia. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented song singer / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he appeared in several big-budget productions ("initial D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he won the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong film awards for "Initial D". <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is very well chosen, which attracts almost all Chinese people. The cast includes many famous film / TV actors, singers, even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang of China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu assumed the position of director and writer. He has a reputation for making superficial and brainless films based on non-coherent scripts. With its misdirection and its history, all the talented cast, the fantasy vision effects and the production money tones were wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the terrible movie took more than 10 million dollars, maybe even more in Asia. , which made this one of the biggest blockbusters in Asia. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talent are wasted, or if you're simply accompanying your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.
