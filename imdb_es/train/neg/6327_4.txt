I thought that this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a parody of the spy generator, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie fell short. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up a school of spies to teach their spies how to act as Americans, but the city they set up to train is a little outdated, so they take two pulls from the US. UU To spice things up above. I do not know, but this seems to be out there. It becomes really strange when almost nobody in this Russian city speaks with a Russian accent. Someone ruined the casting work. <br /> <br /> Also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There's one, two tops of fun places, and they're nothing to sing and dance. The movie at the end will probably make you sleep. <br /> <br /> And, like a punch in the face, this movie is so pro from the United States that it makes me sick. The movie keeps saying again and again, America is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was made against the Japanese in World War II. They are movies like these that make everyone think that the United States is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gets a 4 out of 10, and I'm being nice. I really should get one, but the dance scene was fun, but again it got too long to be really fun.
