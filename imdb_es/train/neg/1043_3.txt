What a bad, bad movie! I can not believe all the hype that has been lavished with this pretentious amateur excuse for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, amazed by how bad the direction and the camera work of that film was! And read worship articles that affirm that there is truth and reality in this movie when in reality everything that is is a blatant attempt to get the wool out of critics and festivals by being cheap and moody. <br /> <br /> At least this movie showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad filmmaking than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs. You want to recover your time! I know I did it.
