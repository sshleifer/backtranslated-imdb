Oh my God! This movie insults everyone's intelligence. I mean really, who thinks that three children can fight between 30 and 40 ninjas and win. Not to mention the brainless humor that is thrown. This movie is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad. The film is an omen, the only thing for which it is good is a time killer or involuntary laughter.
