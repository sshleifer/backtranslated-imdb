['Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I saw was &quot;42nd Street&quot;. Then he hoped that all his things were so good. I discovered that that was not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite actor of the classical era, James Cagney. <br /><br /> Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many of the others and pretty boring. It seems that they always involve shouting, producers of unhappy shows. In this movie, it&#39;s Cagney who ends up screaming things so often that my head hurts after a while and his character vanishes ... fast! <br /><br /> Even the songs here are anywhere near the &quot;42nd Street&quot; class, songs that could be hummed for years and decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early films of Cagney, and the Berkeley films, I totally dislike and was very disappointed to see them.']
