I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Simply terrible I like Shaw Bros. movies (I do not hate), and I had high expectations regarding this since I found it on the list of many of the websites of "10 Best Kung Fu Movies / Martial Arts Movies" . (Now I am convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut and paste jobs). First of all, there is hardly any action in the movie. Most of the film is talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because, at best, it is thin. And the action itself may have been impressive in 1978, but it's a routine by today's standards. A special warning for Netflix users: the DVD they send is terrible; The image is terrible and has not even been improved 16: 9.
