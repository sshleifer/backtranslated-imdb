All right, folks, a serious movie buff is expected to see all kinds of movies, both bad and good, and this movie put me to the test. I will not sting the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The performance was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to improve this movie. In fact, I asked myself why I bothered to watch this film of poor quality? Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff and, therefore, I can not avoid what should otherwise be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining exactly what went wrong in this amateur movie, except to say that the quality of the performance was, to put it politely, subpair. A serious movie buff may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. Stay at home, do not waste your time, read a book, take homework or have a good sandwich.
