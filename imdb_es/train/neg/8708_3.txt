Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can not be more rigid or more false than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot did not make any sense. I mean, first they're on a bus, then they're in a warehouse and then, suddenly, they're on a ship. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together in a van or on a boat? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit in a moving truck. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this a 3, is because it is still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (I have not seen the second yet). Simply, do not rent it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing that I did it because I would not have wanted to spend money renting it.
