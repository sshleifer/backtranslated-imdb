I can not help it, but I seem to like movies that are meant to be scary and are just bad. Personally I have included it in my list of the 10 worst movies, under the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and have fun, but do not expect to see any academy awards for acting. More possibilities to understand the movie itself. In all honesty, although I've seen much worse than this. In addition, a little maniac crossing the desert eliminating the same people who have just died is incredible that it becomes something original. I think it's one of those love or hate movies. You can decide for yourself, but it's horrible, but somehow you do it that's why I love you.
