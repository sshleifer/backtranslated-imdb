It is not a very good movie, but according to the information it is quite accurate when describing torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and that has been done effectively enough, with surprising frankness at the moment. Regardless of the technical flaws that exist (and there are many) to see this, you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some rather unpleasant things; once again, unpleasant because it is being done north of the demilitarized zone and not in Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I do not think any of the Korean veterans have denounced their torture when running for office, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to the Vietnam movies. I do not know if it was the people in '54 caught up in the concepts of World War II (the guys tend to joke a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans".
