The highlight of this film for me was, without a doubt, Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely selected against the guy and proved that he can handle a non-traditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie, the one you like, admire and support. Sullivan was definitely not a good boy. It is true that, in the context of this film, he showed something noble: his purpose was to avenge the murders of his wife and younger son. Even so, he was already a gangster and a murderer before those murders. So Hanks took on a role in which he would not have expected to enter, and he did it well. <br /> <br /> Putting aside Hanks' good performance, however, I certainly could not call this a nice movie. After an opening that I would describe better as enigmatic (I was not entirely clear for a time where this was going) it becomes a very grim film, about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster, largely posed by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mafia boss, who tries to raise his two children and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from your business. After the eldest son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him calm, makes a mistake with the son (and the mother) and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange type of parent / child bond movie. <br /> <br /> Although it ends with a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the general context of the story) it is really very dark at all times, that state of mind is reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in the dark and the torrential rain. I have to confess that, while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the film as a whole simply did not stop me. 4/10
