A Blair Witch-War movie that is as disappointing as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save money and time, and spend it on a good movie like "Once Upon a Time in America," "The Redemption of Shawshank" or "Enemy in the Gates" (if you want to see a GREAT movie of "war" ) etc. <br /> <br /> This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A were the rookies, then this movie was the high school dance. It was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with his father's old camera. Of course they entered a hostile area (to make a movie) but I do not call it brave, we call it here stupid! This is a pass to the end! Now go see it and then tell me what you think.
