I saw this movie on a drive-in in 1959. Until "Howard the Duck" I considered it the worst movie I had ever seen. This movie tried to combine all the genres into one; The comedy, the horror, the adolescent anguish and the hot rod that should have given birth to "My mother, the car." Maybe he deserves a second visit to see if it is an accurate reflection of his time.
