While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor bites a doctor causing some alarming side effects ... <br /> <br /> Occasionally, a creepy atmosphere and some decent makeup effects (although less used) do not save this B's horror movie of being a secondary tale of man-becomes a creature. The Bat People, aka It Lives By Night, suffers for its meaningless story that is coarsely drawn and lacking in the rhythm. The plot never seems to go anywhere and the movie never offers an explanation of what happens, not even a satisfactory conclusion of all this. The cast is quite mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> I still give the movie some points for its disturbing theme and good shooting locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is also quite good, but here there is not much showcase. A safe lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smallest man-creature movies out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
