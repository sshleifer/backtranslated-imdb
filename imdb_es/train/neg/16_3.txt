There are many extremely beautiful people in this movie. That is probably the best part of this. Maybe that even makes it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is about to make his mark in the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation and is on his way to law school. But like so many other adjustments, things are not as perfect as they seem. The expectations in this family far exceed the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him out of the house. This seems to be the result of a past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks, but it is not explained until the end. The claustrophobic atmosphere of Tristan lets him unleash in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a party at the beach house, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who takes him to an underworld of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Although technically it is well done, this film suffers from a mediocre script and a story that is not very attractive. Also in this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place, such as slow motion, fast camera, freeze frames and echoes. These are the types of effects that a director can normally use to show a character's perspective while taking drugs, except that in this case they seem to have been released sporadically at random points, in some attempt at cheap style. <br /> <br /> Despite their share of relative unknowns, the performances were good in general, especially with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect that we will see at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when mentioning the actors, I should mention their appearance. Rating based on heat, this movie has a score of 11. The women in this movie look amazing and almost distract you from the boring movie you're watching. I am sure that the male characters are also quite attractive, but you will have to ask someone else to comment on it. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this movie, not to buy, rent, or even watching for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort necessary to sit down.
