I think this is almost all I need to say. Although I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I've never seen such a production of armor, and I say it in every sense of the word. Although the physical work of the camera, the rise of the MIC and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately they are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts, their great characterization and plot, unfortunately has a horrible script, a horrible performance and worst of all, terribly annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for each independent film that is distributed, like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other independent films that died in silence. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers know about at Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this production of an amateur family came to be distributed. I'm pretty baffled as to why they picked it up. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this movie that presents some intrigue is its title. However, the reason for this is even a disappointment. I hope this review prevents some people who are intrigued by the title of this film from seeing it. I've seen many movies in my time, and I forgive a lot when I'm in the movies, but this was too much. I will never forget the 'tunnel', to mark an important point in my life experience of cinema. It's a shame it's such a low point.
