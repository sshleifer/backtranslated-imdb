Boy this movie had cheated me. Honestly, I thought it would be a horror movie without any kind of humor, boy, I kept my shoulder cold this time. This movie was, and I'm sincere, very good. It was not terrifying at all, but the enthusiasm and cunning humor really upset this movie. Some of the horrible assassinations of acts and clichés were so painful to see, that I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to a certain extent I enjoyed it. All the murders are vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more interesting. The angles of the POV camera were impressive. <br /> <br /> The film is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident with a chemical truck while being transferred to jail. Later it was resurrected in that same chemical product with the snow spliced ​​into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He takes his revenge, like the snowman, on the police officer who condemned him. <br /> <br /> This movie had such a bad performance, with the exception of Christopher Allport, which was funny. I will say that I am also quite disappointed that this film was not a horror, but a dark comedy. They had a great story with a good plot, but it did not work well. In general, I like the movie at first, but now it's really annoying. But this movie is much better and darker than the sequel.
