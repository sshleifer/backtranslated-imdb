This could have been a good episode but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was horrible to watch. Have manufacturers ever set foot in Britain before filming? At least set foot in England? I do not think any British person has had so much accent apart from a real family comedy comedy! Also with the 2 English boys ... well, I do not think any English boy has acted, spoken or dressed like any English boy in the history of the British nation since the pre-teen public appearances of Prince William and Harry. For American filmmakers .. There is more than 1 country in the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It means more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but this was so bad that I could not see it. Although the fire looked great!
