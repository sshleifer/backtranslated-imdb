I went to see him hoping for a bit of the old Alice Entertainment. Once I realized I was not going to get it, I saw it in a fairly well made movie (in terms of shooting, and yes ... that was it). But in addition to having a good film quality, considering that I had been watching granular movies all day, there was nothing good in that movie. <br /> <br /> Killed 42. Why was Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer that for me? Who can answer anything horrible about this movie for me? <br /> <br /> I agree with whoever said it was just a big internal joke for the staff. That is all. It seemed to be. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr.Carroll. I'm sorry that someone did that to his wonderful stories.
