If you have a lot of time to lose ... it's fine. It moves at a good pace, but to get this movie out it would have to be a bit more with a little more information about the nanny. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine. Mariana Klaveno as a model does the best job and is the most credible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses had a pretty good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reasons she went back to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit silly. Like most of these actor films ... there are parts that are interesting ... but in general it leaves you wondering why you spent your time.
