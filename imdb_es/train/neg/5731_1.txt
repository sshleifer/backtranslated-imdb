I saw the unrated version of this movie and I realized that in about 30 minutes I was not getting my time back. Persevere to the end in the hope that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic and the special FX would look really special. I was so wrong I love horror, I'm a complete gore hound. I have some of the eighty splash films among the greats of the film world. However, this was not done in the eighties, if this movie came out in the early eighties, you could forgive the fax for looking so bad. It was not like that he does not have that defense. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines that he was making a face for writing instead of writhing in the face of torture. I do not like the hostel, I never did, I thought I was overrated, over exaggerated and I did not feel anything for the protagonists, however, it shines like a beacon for greatness next to this garbage. The back of the Live Feed cover promised a turn that you would never see coming, I'm still waiting for the promised turnaround.
