The creatures of the title wreak havoc in a small and quiet desert city. That's basically the whole plot of this film, and while the scenes dedicated to the Munchies in themselves are a bit funny (in a little cultured way), the rest is just a filler, and a bad filler. From the "hero", who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the city policeman, who is very stupid, it is difficult to choose the most irritating character in the film. There were some moments when almost everyone was on the screen together and thought: "Well, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the rest of those idiots?" The movie is also full of pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably already did in the early 90's. (* 1/2)
