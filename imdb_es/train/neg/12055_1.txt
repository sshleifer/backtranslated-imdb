Do not waste your money or your time on this pitiful movie in the form of cinematography. When every third word is dedicated to the rude language and there is no real plot, in addition to having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same performances dated from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves much to be said. I expected something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puerto Ricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores. An incorrect word at a given moment in a movie can be used to emphasize a particular point of view and can even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred, for example) but it should not impregnate the plot. The movie is a total shame and there was absolutely nothing funny or cute in this movie.
