I would like to say that, unlike many of the people who did not like this movie and found it impossible to understand, I could understand it for what it is ... A very incoherent plot attempt. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw this word, but in this case it fits very well. First, the director presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" manner and, what is worse, extremely incoherent. It is incoherent because it presents the material in a disorderly and disorganized order, which makes us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes are more important and arrogant, since at 2 o'clock they wait for us, the viewer who will CARE at the end Of it. <br /> <br /> I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story about a more than real world that is not linked to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a history placed in ordinary modern times, and in a modern environment on Earth, the most important thing is that is not able to attract the audience. but, in addition, simply a series of evicted events that barely join. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is to see a story; perhaps even a VERY GOOD story, since it was based on a book, but is frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments or link any means of coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare the "Seoul contre tous" by Gaspar Noe with this. It gave us a coherent story, extremely interesting and intellectually profound. This film does not offer intellectual studies, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director finally abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we have left is a series of events that are hardly related to each other. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is possible to make sense of things ... at a POINT. But as I said before, the viewer will reach a stage where he will simply say "Who cares". It develops like seeing a mundane and monotonous story of a man who goes to the supermarket and buys groceries in a non-chronological order. Even with the murders he is completely disinterested and unattractive. Too many people these days will give a high score to something they can not understand or make no sense just for fear of looking silly, and in every way this film PROOF to make the viewer look silly. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time on your hands, then watch this movie, considering what I said about it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my final reasoning.
