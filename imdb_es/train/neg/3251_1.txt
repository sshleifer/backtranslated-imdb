I caught this movie on FX last night, and while I was sitting there watching it, it occurred to me that it could possibly be the worst movie in history. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally incredible fight sequences, stupid characters. All this made it the most ridiculously bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, that I was captivated by the lack of something semi-competent that I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel!
