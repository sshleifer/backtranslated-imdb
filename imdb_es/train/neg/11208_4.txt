Raymond Burr plays a lawyer caught in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for the wife of his friend (Angela Lansbury). This was a full year before he began to play Perry Mason, so the film could be of particular interest to his followers if it were the inspiration for his casting. <br /> <br /> There's not much else here, that's interesting though Lansbury is always good, but his character here is very one-dimensional and the reasons for his crime in the mystery are totally obvious. Lamont Johnson interestingly interprets a painter who is also in love with the "fatal woman", but the character of Burr is quite simple. It's downright strange to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his choppy presentation does not match his character here as he does in most of the movies I've seen him in. There's no real mystery, and all the suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way in which Burr's character is shaping Lansbury's character to involve herself (the double risk prevents her from turning it around) to try for the original murder, presumably). She does it with a very large tape recorder that she does not notice when she enters the room, I suppose. <br /> <br /> A few moments maybe not fun and, basically, the rest could have been done for TELEVISION.
