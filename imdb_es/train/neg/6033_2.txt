Guys who ever even THINK about watching this movie already have some disturbance in their heads. This movie has NOTHING to do with Jack the Ripper (in case you have thought of it) is another B, I mean an E-Grade movie composed of a group of horny teens in certain sex scenes that are observed just before that the spleen is splashed on a nearby tree. It's not scary, fun or funny. If you really feel like something bloody without a plot, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep in the middle of the direction of this shit. Just look at this if you have absolutely nothing to do in life and the only thing on television is Oprah. Winfrey crying on the television.
