Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer who tries to kill her on her graduation night. And in doing so, killing his family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I begin, let me tell you that you are tired of the PG-13 horror movies that have not been scary lately. Are you tired of the stupid girl's dialogue "Oh, my God" and talking about girlish things? And are you really tired of having girls in relationships and then crying? And the last thing is that you're tired of the United States redoing Asian, Japanese and Chinese films. That sums up pretty well on graduation night, but I'm not done with the review yet. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see 'Graduation Night' is to laugh at the murders. If not, do not see the night of graduation. You never see the deaths and you only hear screams and see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeated as 24/7. So not only are they not scary but they are unpleasant. When I met the cast, I think I was ready to pitch. Too much girl talk, too much boy talk, and a lot of 'Oh, my God. It's our prom. I understand it's fun but seriously it's too much to ask that they do not concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I had to put Prom Night on the list of the worst movies of 2008 without seeing the other films, I would also be the first. I would not be surprised if it was released on DVD cheaply and quickly. Seriously, do not waste your money or time for a boring performance, cheap scams and a 'Night to die' when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS, if I could give The film zero stars I would).
