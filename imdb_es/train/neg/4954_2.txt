I grew up watching the original Batman animated series, and I'm an avid collector of Batman graphic novels. With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman, there are certain traits that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are fine, but when the character changes completely, it's too far away. I bought one of the seasons of "The Batman" with the hope that an additional extra feature could shed some light on the reasoning of the creators to make this show an atrocity. In an interview about the creation of "The Batman," one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said "we feel we should not mess with Batman, but we can mess with the villains." So, they proceeded to turn the Joker into an immature child who wanted attention, the Penguin into an anime impersonator, Freeze into a super powerful jewel thief, Poison Ivy into a teenage hippie, and countless other shameful acts Bob Kane he turns in his grave. <br /> <br /> To summarize everything: I would like to have more hands to be able to give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It is tightened by my rating with 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the name of Batman. Warner Bros ... rethink this! Please!
