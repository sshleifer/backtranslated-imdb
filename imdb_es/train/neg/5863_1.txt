I really can not believe that this movie is not in the worst IMDB 250, it is absolutely terrible. When I first saw him, I remember talking to him in a university class and two other people had also seen him. We all told other members of the class not to see it because it was so horrible. When we finished, others wanted to see it only because they could not believe that something was as bad as we said. Do not be like them, only this happens. I am sure that everyone involved in this movie will also prefer that you never see them in this movie.
