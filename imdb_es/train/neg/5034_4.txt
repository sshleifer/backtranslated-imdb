I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few criticisms that have to be positive. I saw the movie and it disappointed me a lot. I did not find it very pleasant at all. It was slow, and lacked the entertainment value. Even murder scenes are mediocre, with real shots of generic shots that do not look good at all. And the supposedly great end of spin really is not much, I saw it coming, and then the ending just seemed like a clich√©. This film may not receive much mention, but because of the little it receives, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.
