I recently saw the first Guinea Pig movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I must admit that I am disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is invariably included in any list of the "most unpleasant" movies and maybe I expected more because of the hype. However, the truth is that I do not qualify it. <br /> <br /> If I had been seeing it believing that the opening text was true ("I found this tape ..."), it could have been A little disturbed by that, thinking it was real. However, even without the benefit of knowing that it is not real, I think I would have realized that it was not so. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is being done to her. they just are not what they should be. She should be screaming like a banshee in pain. The fact that she is not mean that obviously is not real. I would not like to see it if it were real, but if it were more convincing in its performance, the film would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing affected me. Not at all until the scalpel in the hand. The hot oil, worms and entrails just did not bother me. I'm not saying it's "hard"; I just could not suspend my disbelief, partly because of the girl's lack of action. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me shudder a little, but the hammer in my hand only made the hand look like rubber. And the final scene with the eye was again a little shaken but nothing more. I did not want to look the other way and I did not feel nauseated either. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is twenty or more years old, or maybe I'm tired. The truth is that I did not find this film at all disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing you can expect to see playing in a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise to remove characters. , history etc. and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. However, as part of a disturbing movie, at least it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pig with my wife, who is "inclined to a movie" and wondered what it would be like. the commotion was ready. We discussed why I see these films and my reasons are many, but they include the desire to be affected by a movie. She said she did not think any movie could be so convincing as to upset her and challenged me to do just that. I touched the Irreversible firefighting scene and, in fact, I was disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I have a point, other than that we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror. Film genre that any film up to the moment that is proposed to disturb.
