Once again, a classic of the film has been remade uselessly with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as it is all about this movie. The period is not presented persuasively, and potential clients seem too young and too lazy to be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, this would be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version deviated from the facts, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and innovative for 1967, and had some outstanding performances that allowed it to worry. This 1992 remake seems out of the original film instead of the truth as it is known and the actors in this version are insensitive, unattractive, and in the least interesting. Of course, skip this and wait for the 2010 version to be better. It could be worse?
