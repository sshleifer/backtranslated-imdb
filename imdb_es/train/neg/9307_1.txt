I rented this movie about a month ago, when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH'. The acting is so bad that I have seen children in high school do a better job. The whole cast seems to be just reading their lines, without feelings, without emotions. , and there is no space to capture the viewer. On another note, the special effects were incredibly cheesy and everything seemed to have been filmed with a camera that anyone can buy on a radio. <br /> <br /> The clown looks nothing like the one on the cover of the video. Hell, he does not even appear in the movie until almost the end and everything he does sounded songs and went stalking some characters. Nor is any real murder shown, so it's not a real movie either. Since I've seen it, I've questioned some things 1. If it's 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' Would not it be a Serial Killer that kills? clowns 2. If your friend is lost, why would you go out into the woods to have sex instead of looking for her? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only REAL performance emerged in vain at the end suddenly? Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their work? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it so you do not waste an hour or two laughing more than yelling.
