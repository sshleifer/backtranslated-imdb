It was pointed out in a publication now deleted from another IMDb user that anyone who could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned about a scene that eerily recalls the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope that anyone reading this considers this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced the Oscar-nominated "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi") and an international actor In the cast, I found that "The Medusa Touch" was an uproar of unintentional laughter. It was a badly directed disaster, horribly written and acted. He tried to capitalize on the telekinetic thriller genre of the 70s. The movie fails in many ways. Please consider "Carrie" and the underestimated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject.
