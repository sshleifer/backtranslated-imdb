I had the opportunity to preview this movie as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the opportunity to complete the post-screening survey. I felt that the biggest problem with the film was its lack of a main argument. Instead, it was composed of (too) many subplots that compete for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character that is sufficiently developed for the audience to form any kind of link. What the director and the producer did not do was show us why we should worry about what happens to the characters. In fact, any subplot and the associated characters could have been eliminated completely without serious damage to the film. (The time gained would have allowed the much needed development of the remaining subplots and characters). In a nutshell, The Hungry Bachelors Club's plate is packed with side dishes and appetizers when a main course is desired.
