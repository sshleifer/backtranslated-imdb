I saw a trailer for this in another video and decided to rent it when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (apart from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I did not care about the characters, other than wanting to see Nora's husband beaten. The role of Christopher Walken is so disposable, what a mockery!
