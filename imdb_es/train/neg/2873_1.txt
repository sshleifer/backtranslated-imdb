This movie features a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. She has impressive green eyes, and is in the first scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. It is possible that she has no future as an actress, because this type of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills the races. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend. It is not a good horror movie, nor a good false journalistic report, nor remotely well done. There is no apparent skill in its production. It's like a bad student movie. The horrible elements of the story do not make you sick, it's the fact that it's so badly made that it makes you sick. I would give this film ZERO stars if I could.
