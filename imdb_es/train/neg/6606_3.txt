Please, do not hate me, but I have to be honest, seeing this movie, I had a lot of fun ... <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a stupid cast and stupid songs! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Holi ... well ... it was good! Because of Tradition, every movie has to have one! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very stupid song from UNNEED jee Le ... It sounded like a Playboy song stupid song ... <br /> <br /> Aside from the songs. The movie was good. This was Ram Gopal Verma's own adaptation ... If you think like that, you'll like this movie <br /> <br /> Well, this movie only depends on the viewer and his criteria if he / she thinks this is the film is total . Copy. He / she would like to bang his / her head in the cinema seat. Or if he / she thinks about the director's own aspect, he / she would be relaxed and have a look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway I looked both ways to congratulate and abuse Ram Gopal for this disaster he did ... <br /> <br /> Well, some other things that bothered the CAST were incredibly bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own remake of the film, what the director thought) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek was assigned to this role despite making a special Apparition in Mehbooba's song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right, Tabu was right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think is ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal as Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute ... Ups, I'm sorry, hehehe, I was fine, I could not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The film would have been even FAIRED Little if the cast was good <br /> <br /> The movie was not even exciting, the movie was bie n, just to see it <br /> <br /> The overall rating <br /> <br /> Address ... 8/10 I got you some credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD script songs ... 5/10 Not necessary in the movie, it could have been better, easy on the ears It will be played on PC's, Ipod's and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
