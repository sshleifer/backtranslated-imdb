"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer of free burial services in case you die when you see it. Now there is a hook! The story itself has a rather interesting premise for a horror movie: the scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with sharp noises, mysterious blows and skulls that appear at inopportune moments. Add to the formula a sufficiently spooky gardener who still keeps the memory of the first wife of the man to whom he was dedicated. Maybe it's that the 1950s did not have the technology to carry out some of the scary scenes needed to animate this movie, the techniques used here seem artificial and mundane. But, once again, when I saw "House on Haunted Hill" for the first time, when I was nine, I got the creeps in the same way that I'm sure this movie did for the young viewers of the same time. <br /> <Br /> Do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, sometimes it seems tedious. But there is a great atmospheric tension in the usually huge but unfurnished Whitlock house, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me, the best scene involved involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) who becomes manic in the pond trying to recover the hidden skull, he just wades in the clothes and everything, in clear contrast with the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a double role). Makes you wonder who the real jerk was. <br /> <br /> In its own way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie: how about that nasty roadster in which the Whitlock appear for the first time? 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!
