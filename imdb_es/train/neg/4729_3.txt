LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis' strangest movies. Part slapstick, part fluff, part surreal and part strange. Elvis meets a girl very out of rhythm with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense as is the case with most Elvis Presley movies, and there are a lot of strange characters in abundance. There is not much music in this, but I liked what there is, although none is memorable. Strange continuity Elvis and Michelle Carey go to their house on the beach at night, but a few minutes later, a delivery boy arrives and it's completely diurnal! What?? That is about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
