When I rented "Unhinged", I expected a bloody movie. The box even affirmed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical premiere (now I have serious doubts about this premiere in the theater). After finishing the movie, I wondered how I could even receive a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: a group of three young women on a car trip collided their car against a tree. These women somehow manage to reach a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film is composed mainly of useless scenes that aim to make the film long enough for its release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie horrible is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading her lines of reference letters. The others who act are bad, but not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. This becomes very annoying as the movie progresses. In addition to all that, there is very little blood, which makes the box very deceptive. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this. My rating: 1 of 10
