R O B O T X X. <br /> <br /> Burn the teacher. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely horrible. <br /> <br /> Without end; without closing. <br /> <br /> Complete and absolutely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this unpublished, unedited, unscripted, unscripted, unproduced mess of a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just discovered - HAVE A SECOND ONE!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their movies. This mess of things makes these movies just bad, not terrible, horrible and grotesque how are you. This is the only movie I have said this for: ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡!!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment useful.
