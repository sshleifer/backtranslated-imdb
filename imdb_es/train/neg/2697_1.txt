On the basis of the personal experiences of the era of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, Higher Learning emerged. A film focused on racial politics that occurs in modern universities. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters in which the film bases its foundation on its history: Malik Williams, a carefree and low-educated athlete who is an African American male Kristin Conner, a soft white girl , protected, and Remy, a white man not connected and unsophisticated. The three are overcome by the sudden reality that college life is not as good as advertised, since all three go through disappointment by not being prepared (Malik), being naive (Kristin) and not being desired (Remy ). <Br /> <br /> One good thing about the movie is that it shows that the modern universities in the United States are just large high schools. Universities are not places to develop character, develop potential or improve personal progress, but are institutions that are used to bring together all types of students in a unique environment. It is an experience that is usually built for the failure of most students. It would have been nice if the movie created a story about this parody instead of racial politics. <br /> <br /> But it was not like that and that's where the movie falls apart. Singleton, it seems, had a pretty bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie he lets everything go well. There is no need to walk around here. Singleton allows you to easily see the heroes and villains of this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the film are seen as the heroes here, while all the white people in the film are seen as villains, except for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this movie? The black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out who supposedly raped her. The ease that black gang members have in college, while a group of skinheads are in a small, dark bedroom planning violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third options for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin, but they were not available). O'Shea Jackson, also known as Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King, were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was unfortunately bad here as a history teacher. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did it considering that his character, of the three main characters, was the one that changed the most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American College Life with this movie. And he did it quite badly. It was like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much more complex than it seems and people are the same everywhere and he should know it. Higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. Seeing the movie, then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and anger the same audience that I would like to talk to. Not to mention that it would not entertain them in the least.
