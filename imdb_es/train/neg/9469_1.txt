Audrey, I know you really appreciate the memory of your husband Ted, but PLEASE, do justice to your legacy and heed your wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop taking advantage of their stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are being knocked down by the powers that are Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be trapped with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever contaminate the warmth and innocence of their books. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is your property to do what you want with your wishes. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
