I searched for this movie for a reason: Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time, along with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the terrible pantheon. However, I felt a little disappointed because, even though the movie was really bad, it never approached the horror levels of some of his previous unhinged movies. Because of that, this movie was not particularly fun to watch for fans of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Now I distrusted to see this movie, since the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie sound like a pornography. movie - something I would not be reviewing in IMDb. However, this movie seemed to be this sometimes, especially the first 10 minutes. But, you could say that the script underwent many changes, since in a large part of the film there is no excitement at all and towards the end of the film there is a plot that comes from anywhere where it is violent and certainly NOT sexy ! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is even good. For example, like a porn video, it shows surprisingly little And it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71-year-old boy in some of the love scenes. Of course, for a 71-year-old man, Mr. Livingston looked pretty good, but he was still an older man and no one would want him to get down to work with the young nymphs! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston became a guy like Rambo! Talk about strange and inappropriate things. <br /> <br /> In general, there are few recommendations for this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to worry about and the movie manages to be quite boring even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses".
