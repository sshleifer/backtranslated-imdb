The plot is about a nurse, named Anna, who is caught in the middle of a world chaos as zombies that eat meat begin to rise, conquer the world and attack the living. She escapes to the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far so good! Normally I like horror movies, but this piece of film does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "the Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more emotion. It's like watching a group of bloodthirsty drunks not being able to enter a mall to buy more liquor. The heroes who have locked themselves inside the shopping center to avoid being eaten by outside thugs are not better either. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it on this!
