But I got over it. For me, it seemed that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I felt very sorry for the character of Louise, and she was constantly compared with Esau, who was evil, I felt that the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Actually, however, the movie was bad. I really would not see it unless you're ready for a big disappointment.
