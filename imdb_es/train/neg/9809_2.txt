Some wonder why there were no more Mrs. Murphy's movies after this one. It will be because this movie totally exploded. Disney was not the proper studio to direct this movie. Maybe it's Touchstone (well, it's owned by Disney, but it would be more adult). The film is too childish, as the series of books is not. The casting is wrong for the characters. The characters do not even act as they do in books. And why did Tucker change to a boy? She's a girl in the damn books! Was this done to make the movie attractive to the boys? Sheesh And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney exploit her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the vein of Don Bluth's artwork, would be adapted to a better film by Mrs. Murphy. In general, I give it a 2, because at least Disney made a film from a series of books unappreciated. But, I'd like you to do it better. Either way, I still have my books to entertain me.
