I saw this movie as I liked the plot, a group of strangers are held captive trying to discover how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The stage and premise were obviously influenced by the first (and the best) saw the film and although there was not much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a comedy relief in the form of the two 'alpha males' who fought and it was a pleasant surprise (for anyway, see that Melissa Joan Hart has not surrendered yet in the acting. <br /> <br /> Some things disappointed me personally: 1. The pedophile was characterized in excess by what went on with everything from children to dead bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. The line MJH about his former police officer 'putting her in this' when in reality he was the least worthy person to be there, he had not contributed KNOWING the events that led to his capture. <br /> <br /> 3. The end ... what kind of film ends up in the middle of something that is happening? There was no resolution, no slope on the cliff, no obvious ending ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And that's why I went down two stars of my rating The first 2 points would let them slide but not at the end!
