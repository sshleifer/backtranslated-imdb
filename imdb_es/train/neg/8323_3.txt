From the beginning this movie had some flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a young and wealthy tycoon who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and is struggling to fill his father's shoes and cut the ropes of the apron that the mother (and the executive) kept too tight. He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in limbo for the organ donor registry. There are also minor side stories that your first instinct is to ignore for the most part and then be important, such as your friendship with your surgeon (Terrence Howard) and your romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative story lines, but not enough to ruin the movie. The only true "oy vey!" The moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. The dominant woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that, people who think that surgical scenes are scary, no. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was good at first. Observe in emotional agony as Christensen shouts internally through the incision in the chest and the rib spacer. The ironic moment of the trailers comes when, while he is one of the few unfortunates who are awake during the anesthesia, he is also lucky because it helps him to know that his surgical team plans to assassinate him. <br /> <br /> The big turn, however, is very predictable and sends the film to dig deeper into the conspiracy and its memories of the little signs that were there, but he, like us, was initially lost. <br /> <br /> There are two more turns at the end that involve your relationship with your mother. One is an impressive gesture of Olin, which is unimpressive due to bad writing. The other is a secret about the family's past, which seemed to be very definite and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-done anesthesia awareness drama is lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is one last attempt to bring him back that he falls, taking the whole movie with him.
