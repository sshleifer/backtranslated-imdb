Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after spt11 and the vision of the American Society is hopeful, which makes it 2 out of ten. But this is not a movie. It's the best someone can do with a great idea (the east-west clash). There are important things that happen in the Middle East and are only broadcast on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is really on the level of stupidity (because he is ignorant of the facts). The characters are not well formed. And the most important thing is that the idea that is given with religion is something funny for me. In the final scene, Lana says: "Be quiet and try to listen". And the background music says "... I'll do it". pray. "The thing has nothing to do with religion in reality, but it ends with this, how will you see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray, the lights already shine on the truth, it's just that no one wants to see that. ps: "My home is not a place. It's people. "The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that phrase, but it is wasted behind this movie (by the way, as" someone "is mentioned below, the best young man in America is not the best, it's just the" poor "and" hopeless "who join the army that needs good checks, which the government does not provide!)
