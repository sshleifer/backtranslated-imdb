Unknown, unclear, bad script, bad photography and direction ... in short, it is a first effort badly conceived for the realization of commercial films by the good people of TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has had great success Success in the past by helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of its programming and who loved "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They do a lot of good with their ministry, but this is not an example of it. Do not waste your money ... go rent "China Cry" instead.
