Primal Species comes from the legend of the movie B Roger Corman and, as such, everyone who sees this needs to realize that this is a low budget B movie and he knows it. <br /> <br /> A group of terrorists attack a truck and if they kill an entire army in doing so, they believe it contains uranium, but No ... It contains two Dino with a taste for human flesh ... Then, A Crack team, which might well be called Delta Force, is called. . <br /> <br /> Ok, this is not Jurassic Park, and Yes The Dino's are never seen clearly because obviously it's a guy with a disguise that is not very different from Barney the dinosaur - only slightly LESS scary, but come for the boys, this had about 1% of Jurassic Park's budget and, as such, does what it can. <br /> <br /> Does this deserve to be in the last 100? I think that almost half of the voters who give it a 1 - are being VERY WELL too severe, it is much closer to a 4 ... it is actually much better than many other films that are not in the Bottom 100, and it has a Production value similar to the production of a science fiction channel. (again the films that have a too hard time on the part of the critics here in IMDb) <br /> <br /> The action is the expected one in a film B, although none of the actors takes it so seriously, nor the script <br /> <br /> In short, it's a nice B movie - Not for movie snobs <br /> <br /> ** of *****
