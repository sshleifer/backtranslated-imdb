The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all the other spy agencies in the world should watch this movie to get information on how to spy on people. (As stated in the MST3k Commentary ... "Sanata has dirt on everyone!" Santa's Tentacles spread everywhere! You can not hide from the Klaus Organization ") <br /> <br /> the telescopes that can spy on millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. It's surprising that the CIA does not have Santa on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... it's so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is tremendous. Very low budget but very fun to watch. I recommend seeing the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000 for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You even laugh at the misfortune of good children. <br /> <br /> I give you a 1 for Quality production and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
