I did not see virtually redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly crazy obsession for it ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe that's a decent quality. In general, however, I found this film surreal and ridiculous. The manual shooting together with the slow motion and other cinematographic tricks seemed to me clumsy and dizzying, even disgusting. In general, the music was horrible and repetitive to the extreme, and it reminded me of the psychological warfare of the US military. UU Against several malcontents. <br /> <br /> The various vignettes that made up the film are random in their location and unsatisfactory. Unresolved in its content and in its "conclusions". A depressing movie (not a true _film_, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe in the various people who try to interpret this as a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly isolated elements of this film that repudiates the content, form and conclusion of any association with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest you stay away despite the seemingly overwhelming positive opinions of IMDb and other rating sources.
