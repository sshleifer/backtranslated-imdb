Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble origins, then it is prosperous, it moves upwards, changes its name and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so that successive generations can advance professionally. History is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes interprets these three roles. For those who missed World War II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is being hailed as an artistic success, but it's a lost opportunity. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; This is reinforced by the narration of the cover of voice and the news footage. The familiar 'plot' is reeling from a predictable event [ie. the Habsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The issue of Jewish assimilation is not focused, and important subtopics [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are up to the end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common incest / infidelity themes. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance, but his performance is far from being an award-winning material. The casting format "3 for 1" is a distraction for the viewer and is more like a cheap movie trick than a good theater. The sun is basically the material of "History Channel" of Hungary. It has the appearance of Winds of War transformed with Forrest Gump transformed with Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
