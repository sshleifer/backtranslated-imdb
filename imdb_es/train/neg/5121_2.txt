I entered this movie thinking it would be a good football drama (in the same sense as Remember the Titans); however, I left feeling like I had just attended a Ted Haggard sermon on the Rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the film. Actually, one would probably get more than one televangelist sermon from this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelist sermon, there are quotations from the Scriptures instead of quotations from the popular self-help pulp. The plot was too predictable to the point that anyone with a sufficiently long attention span could have exposed the entire plot in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
