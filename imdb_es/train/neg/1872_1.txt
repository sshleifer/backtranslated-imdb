Be warned This movie is a disaster. It is a catastrophe. Do not waste your time with this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> The acting, the story, the dialogue, the music ... basically, everything is too exaggerated, it is absolutely annoying and ridiculous. I felt like vomiting (if the dialogue / acting / the story was not doing it, everyone is being shot). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the parts that are supposedly fun are not even fun. The acting, the history, the cinematography, you can feel that everything is trying WAAAAY too hard, but it never succeeds. Virtually every shot is tilted, so what? This movie feels like a student movie. No wonder they filmed it in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to film it in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have fun or you like to act inappropriately, write, edit, direct, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh, and did I mention the bad performance? (Well, actually, it's not the actor's fault, it's the director!) So I think you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to see this in a class. I would have turned it off immediately if I could. If you still can not say it, I hate this movie. It made me want to throw up and recover my time ... at least I did not have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the kind of Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but it certainly went downhill thereafter, accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe.
