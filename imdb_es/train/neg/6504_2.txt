Why did I waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this movie made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One critic said that this movie had patience to see and it was not for everyone. I can not understand who this movie is for. Maybe after dropping an acid hit, SOMEBODY, SOME PART could see this and give it some meaning. It is incoherent, it is not experimental, it is simple and simple garbage. The movie does not follow any plot, only when you think you have something, well ... no. <br /> <br /> I think that the end gave the film a certain purpose (it was not meant to be a play on words), the spectator glimpses what could have been happening. I do not think I put a spoiler here, it does not matter. This film is another one that should be lost in the world of cinema.
