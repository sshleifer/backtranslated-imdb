This movie is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is the kind of mockery of European Americans. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon Yahoos, who do not care about the French; and the character of Xavier will not dominate them. <br /> <br /> Let's consider its stereotyped attributes of French: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, underrated aspect, check, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of gastronomy. Check <br /> <br /> 4). Warm work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact that he is supposedly a wealthy stock broker, seeing him in the movie seems to dedicate ten hours a week). <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. In spite of that: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage vows. Check <br /> <br /> 7). Great sexual ego, which says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Verify <br /> <br /> Whether Mo is an important person or not, there's no reason for her to fall in love with this cocky European idiot other than the script that says so. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, as other male reviewers have done, I enjoyed watching the cute little body of Karen Allen. I will give the film four stars; Two of them are for that.
