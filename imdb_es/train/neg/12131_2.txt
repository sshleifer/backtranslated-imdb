Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately the direction is not his forte. I had a lot of expectations about the film before renting it and maybe that's why I was so upset. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a film that takes place mainly on a small stage, but it is not the attempt that counts. I found the film boring, boring and stretched. The performance was not spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially because he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I liked how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the only picture of the car accident from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and the accident happened. However, that picture was very "usual suspects" and I guess Spacey had the idea of ​​his previous film (which is very good for you). If you want to see a fabulous movie that takes place on a small stage, look at Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have seen it before filming this.
