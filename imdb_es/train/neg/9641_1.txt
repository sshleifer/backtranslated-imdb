If you're watching this movie, you're a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and you thought "What do I have to lose?", Or you turned in the video store with your eyes closed. and I rented the first movie he touched with his finger. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has everything a terrible film needs: a script with amazing dialogues and disconcerting detours of the plot, extravagant science with psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors that not only They are wooden, but it seems to be on the verge of a free and dazed nudity (not everything is what you would necessarily ask), and of course, a 5 'monster played by what I guess is the son of Fred Olen Ray. <br /> <br /> Underneath everything, however, there is something similar to the heart, as if Mickey and Judy decided to gather all the children of the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey, my dad can direct it! Yes We can use red paint from my Johnny's dad's hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can act in it!). <br /> <br /> Watch for the roll of bloper in the credits: you will discover why the final cut of the movie. It was so horrible. <br /> <br /> By the way, Biohazard II ... Alien Force is also worth a visit, but it does not. have the same nice crappy veneer that one has.
