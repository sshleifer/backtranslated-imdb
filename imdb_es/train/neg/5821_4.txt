As others have pointed out, this should have been an excellent film in the style of Hammer, and it seems to me that this is how most of the actors were instructed to reproduce it ... but the script is very important, it has a poor rhythm and it is full of many boring soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton has to carry most of them) that is too exaggerated and self-important. This is an unusually weak Dalton performance, though he silently nails the climactic scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only actor that comes out very well is Patrick Stewart, which is a very well received show. Freddie Francis could have been a great director of photography, but he was a terrible director.
