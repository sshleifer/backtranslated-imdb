This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless. . . Because the stupid producers pay their money to make horrible movies like this instead of donating if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than the white girls! Little Man has an unconvincing excuse to present a character dwarf as a baby. The story is horrible considering it was written by six people. However, the idea would not be so bad, if it were original and not a scam of a cartoon episode. He has funny moments, but some of them are too exaggerated and others are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. That was the address. Anyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of himself. It is racist and very offensive to the dwarves. I mean, instead of showing sympathy for them, the filmmakers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see the dwarves as babies. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. That is his scant excuse to show something like that. It just was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It is a huge waste of time and money.
