The only good thing about this movie was the photo of Goldie Hawn standing in her little French-cut bikini panties and struggling to prevent a dozen other depraved women from taking off her little cotton top while she giggled and River. Ooooof! Their insides rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot almost killed me. I had forgotten all that hidden in the mischievous Roladex of my mind until I saw it on television the other day, where it actually blurred its mid section in that scene, good grief, reminding me that it is a sexy woman who smokes like a Goldie Hawn It was in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
