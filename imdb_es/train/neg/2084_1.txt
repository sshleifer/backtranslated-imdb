If I were given the option of negative numbers I would use it. This movie was really terrible. I went into theaters hoping it was horrible, and somehow managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the performance was painful. I wanted to leave but my friend was driving and I wanted her money to be worth it, I think we're both disappointed. <br /> <br /> The growth of the breasts when the girls got their superpower and hair change. the color was just wrong Eddie Izzard seemed to be wrong about the role of super villain, he was strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came out as psychotic and strange, as did Matt's friend (Luke Wilson), Vaughn (Rainn Wilson).
