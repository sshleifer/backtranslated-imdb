Despite some moments under the heavy rain, a short with Roscoe's silent comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle and the support of Buster Keaton and Al St., a meeting with a drunk and an organ sharpener with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium. John is just entertaining fun, although there is a rather funny sequence of Arbuckle in the flirt with Buster, which is the latest in "cute encounter" scenes, especially because it is one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies. In addition, many scenes seem to have been edited in jump, possibly due to the excessive use of the film. Still, if you're a completrist of Arbuckle or Keaton, Good evening, nurse! It's definitely worth checking out.
