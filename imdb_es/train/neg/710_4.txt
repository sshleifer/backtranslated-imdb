I read Rice's novel with interest, and I was delighted with its characters and their moving story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, they simply APPEARED to me in this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based simply on the physical appearance and not on the talent to act (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was not blond and could not get out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly awkward and inconsistent attempts to affect the French accent were hilarious, but not entertaining. I found myself grimacing through this confused and melodramatic triplet, and I was surprised that I got to the end. <br /> <br /> A warning for the novel's fans: get away from this one.
