A recent post by a woman who claims to have a military background, contained the comment "The life of a woman is not more valuable than that of a man". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not as true as the biology show history. Societies have managed to recover from the great losses of their male population, sometimes with amazing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914-1918 war in which more than two million of its men were killed. In the War of the Triple Alliance of South America (1865), Paraguay confronted three neighboring countries until practically all of its male population was eliminated, but fought to a standstill in the Chaco War of 1932 against a much more Bolivia big. <br /> <br /> No society, however, has survived or could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake, women are sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948, but since then it has never considered mixed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli soldier girl. <br /> <br /> "G. I. Jane" is a Hollywood fuzz.
