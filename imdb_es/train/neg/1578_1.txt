Imagine, say, from 12 to 1 in the morning: you are at home, bored, you are not tired. This scenario occurred approximately, say 4 or more years ago. I turned on the TV, flipped through some channels and discovered that this movie was on. OH MY WORD, this is the worst movie I've seen! A car out of control that can not be stopped (because the brakes were cut or something) on ​​the way to the highway, what will happen? This movie was so bad that it's really funny: I think the maneuvers cost around $ 2, there was a case in which a helicopter pulled a baby / child out of the car in an attempt to enthuse the viewer: a convenient location the bridge was approximate ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD OF A FILM NEVER: shows the child that the bridge is missing for a bit, but it looks so bad, you can almost see the brand of the mannequin that they used: a classic of low total budget! Although I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was GREAT <br /> <br /> I doubt they'll ever show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw this piece of garbage.
