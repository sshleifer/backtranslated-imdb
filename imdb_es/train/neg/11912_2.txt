The story behind this movie is very interesting and, in general, the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, direction, continuity, rhythm, action sequences, acrobatics and use of CG make the film more cheap and damaged. <br /> <br /> First, action sequences. They are all very unexciting. The majority consists of someone who stands up and receives a shot, without trying to run, fight, dodge or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. The sequences seem bland for something made in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG has very well rendered and animated effects, but they look cheap because of the way they are used. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the beginning she can make setbacks, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. Like Lilith, she would not have needed to be able to make setbacks, maybe she could not, since she had wings. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have sequences like a woman run over by a car. , and getting up and just wandering in a deserted room with a sink and a mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the onlookers really cared that she was just run over by a car (and then he felt the side effects of another car exploding) ... "Are you okay?" Ask the driver "Yes, I'm fine," she says, bloodied and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I saw everything, however, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the poor execution made me want something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was a comic relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but this only made me want to wake up the director, and give the writer a good talk.
