At what point does a good movie go wrong? When does a movie go from "visible" to "where is that & ^ @ _ + #! * Switch off"? Thank God for the DVDs, like this one, which can be borrowed from the library, for free! Similarly, thank God for the "fast forward" switch on the DVD player. I'm sorry for those people who were cheated at the box office. <br /> <br /> In a moment (I forgot exactly when because everything is now a blur), our "hero", Luke Wilson starts running through the traffic; I think I was looking for a taxi. It was at that moment when I gave up, realizing that I did not care if he found his vehicle or if he was run over by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson goes up. Outside the container, the hair dryer in your hand and meet the "heroine", Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the criminal who snatches the bag hanging impotently from the fire escape, well above the departure of Luke and Uma. That was the last time the movie was fun, and when was that scene? Ten minutes in the movie? <br /> <br /> Each time the film tried to become "fun", it could not. Each time the film approached the "emotion", it went out and went in the opposite direction. When a musical score could have helped to squeeze the life of this dullard, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were not necessary and were beyond stupid; Damage to unnecessary and childish sets and accessories. When Uma becomes the crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; It was then that I realized there was no turning back because I did not like "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's partner, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the grim "The Last Mimzy") adds nothing but insult to injury in this horrible movie. Rainn Wilson, the king of boredom on television, should stay with that equally horrible medium. Hello Rainn Wilson! Leave the complete moving images alone! Every time Uma's opponent, Anna Faris, appeared on the screen, she expected Jason or Freddy or some scary monster to jump from behind the stage; Once you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie," that's all you see, regardless of the movie, regardless of the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was simply horrible and was so out of place in this movie.
