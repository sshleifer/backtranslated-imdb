The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "revision" of a great play and a film worthy of 1972, a horrible cinematic experience. If I can prevent someone from seeing it, I will have done something good. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with talent, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh approves a set of a note, ugly, sterile. He proceeds to film the film from all artistic angles, distracted and egocentric possible. We see the actors' reflections in stainless steel, in safety monitors, head shots from 200 feet up, close-ups of eyes, chins and more and more. The script, for a Nobel prize, presents long stretches of unpleasant homosexual jokes, which are being falsified by both parties, ... I think? Given the character "turns" how would you know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are crude and unfriendly. The execution time has been reduced by one hour, which is the real problem or the kindest thing that the Director did for us. Actors execute their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely credible. Jude Law is above the limit more than Caine, but as the accredited producer, he must have received the blessing of Branagh. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought it was an ugly, unconvincing aspect of an old classic. . Why was it even done? The paying public spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A work of vanity that fails at every step.
