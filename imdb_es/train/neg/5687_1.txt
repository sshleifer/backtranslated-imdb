Although it's not as bad as your game-to-movie adaptations, this piece of junk does not fare much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does not make good movies. One of these days he will run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs. <br /> <br /> The performance was unsatisfactory, the dialogue sounded as if they were reading TelePrompTers and the little special "touches" by Boll were seen throughout the whole affair. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll movies, this simply should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> Only as Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
