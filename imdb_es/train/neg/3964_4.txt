Despite all the exaggerations about this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would finally think. And, although a little slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is pretty good, with more than a few "old days" that scare and make us nervous. Actually, I thought that the cinematography was excellent with respect to many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is at its climax. The end of the film and the ending are what seems to be MILES APART of his body. The plot falls flat on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I most sought, what was it that REALLY happened to Emma? - It was not clarified! The justification for the negative energy was, at best, ridiculous and, in the end, I felt very cheated. What could have been an excellent horror movie was ultimately pursued by a terrible ending.
