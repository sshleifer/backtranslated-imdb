I do not know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel films, but that's exactly what it feels like. A cheap, low-budget action movie that probably was made very quickly, contains derisory effects, a boring dialogue and a vaguely discolored star to give it a brand recognition (it's funny how many of the 90210 kids are making cheap TV movies now ). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortés, whom we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of natives while conquering parts of North America. Here, one does not play like a hero or even a sympathizer, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed if this was not based loosely on a historical figure. In this story, Cortés is on a brief research mission, trying to find something of value that shows he deserves funding to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the story turns out to be Lieutenant Rios, who turns out to be honorable, witty and wise. He knows what to do in each situation, which puts him in opposition to Cortés, as well as the young and ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the stubborn shaman falls in love with Rios, which increases her anger towards Spanish foreigners. So everything is pretty cliché. Dinosaurs are sent with relative ease. Although it takes place in an area that seems open, the story takes place largely in the forest or in the Aztec village 95% of the time, so it is not visually exciting either. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. He was given a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. However, it does not look or sound in Spanish for a second, which makes the casting choice incorrect in every way. If this movie had been theatrically released, it would have been chosen for a Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> In general, forgettable.
