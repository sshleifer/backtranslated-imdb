What a great pile of manure. Shooting video (REALLY the fucking camcorder, NOT digital) LOT of garbage. It is without a doubt, the stupidest thing ever done. The fact that this shit was really launched is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become more stupid for having seen it. Seriously. I felt that he killed several brain cells after seeing this garbage. The positive criticisms of this to $$ crap were obviously made by the "filmmaker" (and I use the term VERY loose) he and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would sincerely like this loss of life. Trust me, stay away from this video. You will thank me. Avoid it like herpes.
