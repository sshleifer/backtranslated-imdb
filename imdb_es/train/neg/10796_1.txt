This movie shows that "commercial" movies, or else, Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason why this film should have been produced, other than the fact that someone expected a success based on the name of Shaquille. It is worth referring to the plot: it is a little more perplexing than a knot. What else? The screen is somewhat tenuous, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
