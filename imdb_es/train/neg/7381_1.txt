Well, first of all, Seagal's voice is doubled by almost 50% of the movie ... Why? Because apparently they had to rewrite the script and the story while they were filming and they need to change their dialogue for the continuity of the story, since they have several versions. From the beginning, you just scratch your head because overdubs do not just distract, they make no sense. <br /> <br /> That said, the story still stinks and does not make any sense. When I got to the end, I was just scratching my head because the movie was so useless and the ending did not even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop seeing Seagal directly to video films because they get worse and worse.
