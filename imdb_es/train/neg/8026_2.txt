It makes one wonder how this program is still in the air. There has been a couple who have stayed together, married and have children, but everyone else has separated. What is the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining at the beginning. You see all the girls fainted by a man, who almost all like instantly. It's like in real life! The girls begin to take sides, they fuck each other, and show their true selves (or so we think). But that man only has to decide who to choose who thinks he can get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What exactly is true love? How can you fall in love with someone when you are forced to pick them up? This show is incredible. Did you think that going online was bad, but people have to go to the television to find love? It is not realistic. How can a girl be with a man when he goes out with several others, kissing with them? None of these questions has an answer and, finally, when the show ends, you will know that there will not be a happy ending in the future. As far as we know, everything is written.
