The film premiered in early 2000 along with MELA, both disasters. So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film seems to adapt to the 70s, but it seems like an involuntary comedy for 2000. <br /> <br /> Anyway, some of the classic gems of the movie: Paresh Rawal. I do not understand to laugh at his paper or his crying. Reason: he looks for his mother in the village. The worst part is when he realizes Anil's secret and keeps the secret in his stomach. that becomes big and makes him look pregnant. I remember that in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke, Urrf! When I was a kid, I laughed about that, but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke that I can not explain. We have Anil in a double role (one older and younger) and Rekha playing the old man's wife and Raveena, the young woman. We also reject Harish while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani, who fights for who has the worst wig. <br /> <br /> The address is not up to date. The music is bad. <br /> <br /> Anil makes a great effort. he seems too old in the younger role and too young in the older role but good effort Rekha is right, Raveena is also good Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is fine in a cameo
