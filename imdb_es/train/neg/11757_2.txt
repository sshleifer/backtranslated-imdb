Hello, Arnold! It's a slow and a bit boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) is buying all the decrepit and low-priced buildings to build a gigantic shopping center, a shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many movies for children of the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of ​​him as the bad boy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the covert help of Helga, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children must move around the city in buses, so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but it highlights how this movie is written for very young children. Hello, Arnold, the television cartoon is usually very entertaining and has enough humor to attract adults. The television cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey, Arnold, the movie, it's about five times more sedated and it's a good way to put anyone, even the kids to sleep. Hey Arnold it was hard to stay awake until the predictable and totally boring end. If you want to send your children to a totally non-offensive movie, here it is. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producers started with a 30-minute television cartoon script and tried to extend it to 90 minutes. This Mall Story could definitely have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully, Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
