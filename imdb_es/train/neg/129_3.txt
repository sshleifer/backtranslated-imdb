I Am Curious is really two films in one half, it is the experimental sexual side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two do not really fit. The director should have stayed with the romantic side of Lena and have made a separate film for politics. There is a strange mixture of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, jumping breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fiction documentary than a movie. Apart from the interesting sex scenes, you will be bored in the dark watching this movie. Unlike many other critics, I think the nude / sexual scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better options. Widespread nudity is a major distraction from any plot. However, I think the cast did a good job. They played their parts credibly. There is little of the sobriety that I am so accustomed to seeing in American films during this time.
