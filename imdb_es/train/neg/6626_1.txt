I saw the movie and screwed myself, because the movie was dull and boring. I thought that Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie went to waste and they spoiled "sholay". The cast and crew were bad. The whole theater slept while they watched the movie, some people escaped in the middle. the performance of amithab bachan is bad, I thought that this movie would be the biggest success of the year, but this will be the biggest failure of the year, for sure. No one did justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. This movie does not deserve audiences. I bet this movie will fail. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"
