This is a strange and pirated movie, it gives you the feeling that the bond company had to appear in this, I am not surprised that there are no credits, who would want to be associated with this movie. The action of all involved is terribly forced and the plot jumps everywhere, everything makes very little sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to enter because it seems that there was a lot of images that were not taken as they should be, and that all the music was very inadequate for library music (cheap, I suppose). Very, very strange. However, I could buy a DVD if it would let me know what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie.
