I have seen the movie recently and it is similar to the book on which it is based. I blame this for the bad script and the direction. Some parts were introduced by force (the scene of gay rape) for no apparent reason. In fact, I read the book after watching the film and about 20 years after having read it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many disparate ideas were introduced without any benefit ... apart from the sensational parts for the moment. As it covers things that were considered 'sensitive', to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination it produced at that moment. But that is no longer the case or maybe now I see things differently or a little bit of both. The film is too much about covering many aspects of the book, and the result is a mix of scenes that may make sense to someone reading the book. Even so, this is a movie that is hard to see and maybe should never have been done.
