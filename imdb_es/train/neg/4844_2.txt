I am definitely in the minority opinion in this case. "The Hurt Locker" has won more "Best Picture" awards from critical groups than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, but it also cost me to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and little development of characters. Disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. That is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera never stops moving and trembles constantly. This has been a recent fashion in the making of films and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary aspect. The camera was shaking so much that it made me nauseous to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not care about war movies and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not need to take my word because critics love it.
