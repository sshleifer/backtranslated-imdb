This movie was just bad. Almost all the clich√©s of police films are present and taken into account. Does the bad boy get away? check. Partner? check. Crazy shocking clash with partner? check. Newbie with something to prove? check. A grizzled novice appears. check. Almost the only ones he did not touch were the idiots that shoot themselves in the foot and in the retirony, but I think they're keeping those old chestnuts for Dooley's next exit. Add the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with the tired old gags and the banal exaggerated stuff like Dooley's award winning car that is destroyed all the time and has the recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
