First, this movie can be divided into three segments. A promising inauguration, with the ambush of some Cheyenne cavalry. This is followed by what can only be described as a long and boring central section, with Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" totally ill-traveled traveling together to achieve the security of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen issues inappropriate four-letter words every time she opens her mouth, and it looks like she just came out of a 70's movie by Jack Nicholson. I mean, she maintains zero interests, with zero credibility. The third and final section involves the totally free massacre of an Indian village. This is, obviously, exaggerated to rely on propaganda against the war, which seems to be simply long, outrageous and artificial. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comments above) Here is an idea. Why do not you really see the movie you're talking about, instead of singing your liberal nonsense? This is not a political site, it's to review movies. - MERK
