Was Bo Derek's debut film hidden for eight years? And that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor but, as a director, is he practically the Ed Wood of erotic cinema? Not that this is especially explicit, considering that Bo (untypically sporty dark hair) was only 16 years old when the movie was made! Juan also wrote it and photographed it; Does the latter result in some decent images of the configuration of the Greek island against which the narrative is established? But the plot is puerile and the dialogue atrocious! <br /> <br /> The character played by the male protagonist Peter Hooten has grown up with Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters, but now in their teens, the couple discovers that they are attracted to each other (But, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst of this is the fact that the protagonists harbor an obsession throughout the film, which are not only ridiculous in themselves but also irritating because of their implacability. Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modern coastal complex by the sea and still waiting for a cruise to appear (which, of course, it does at the end); Derek's is even more crazy? she longs for the possession of a large antique bathtub !! For the record, the couple is married at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Also involved in the non-events are the mayor of the city and a lothario photographer who wants to make a model of Bo (and who, naturally, incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten). From time to time, for no good reason, we even receive excerpts from the projection of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie theater where the whole city gathers (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931 ])! At the end of the day, while Bo's ingenuity in everything is undeniably charming, it is not enough to counteract the folly and lack of hobby of the film.
