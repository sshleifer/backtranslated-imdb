Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie from an artistic point of view. The plot is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing is too exaggerated. Anyway, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct business thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the film, the band called SENS UNIK) seems to target a wider audience. A direct German film in Switzerland would not have been sold in the French part, and vice versa. What really made me nervous was the product placement throughout the film. Some scenes remembered from advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also believe that the theme of "young people who take drugs without any other purpose in their lives" is a very widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care. I hope that Samir has made enough money with Snow White so that his next film shows his true artistic abilities.
