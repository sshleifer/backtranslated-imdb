Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge. He's trying to scare people by simply making the camera work strangely and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and quite full of holes, for example, how would the center of attention have known that Yoko did not show up to work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He simply came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the child or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the boy in the center of attention found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think more about it.
