I just received the special UK 4-disc edition of Superman 1 for approximately $ 5. Additional material includes the 1951 Superman feature and the Mole-Men. So I put it in the DVD player last night, and here are my conclusions. <br /> <br /> Some initial disappointment: I had not checked it and I think I labeled it mentally as one of Kirk Alyn's serials. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I had not seen anything but the strange Kirk Alyn clip, but hey, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes from one of Reeves' first television series, one of two parts, organized for a movie premiere, although IMDb says it was filmed as a movie premiere before the first television series. In any case, it is a strange choice for reasons that I will arrive later. I am from a time when I remember TV productions and movies that are limited to one or two places and scenarios, so there were no big surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this is REALLY low budget. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the small town of Silsby, with a population of 1,430, which is also home to the deepest oil well in the world (6 miles). The story begins with the foreman of the well taking hasty steps to close the well. This is in conflict with the arrival of reporters from Metropolis, Kent and Lane, to report on the well, at the request of the oil company. When Clark is sniffing the fact that the drill has emerged in a radioactive cavern 6 miles below, a pair of strange little boys (small in stature, big in the head, black in a monkey and bushy in an eyebrow) emerge from the deck . Drill, and start touring the city with bewildered expressions on their faces. <br /> <br /> Now take a deep breath, here is the remaining frame of the image. Young children scare some children, so Jeff Corey (playing the rampant xenophobe of the city) encourages some friends to kill these "creatures". Superman intervenes (moderately ineffective) and catches one of the children who shot him and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's friends burn the hut in which the other little one has hidden and assume that he is dead, but he escapes and kicks the shaft. Corey incites a group of lynchers (even though the sheriff arrested him) to hang the hospitalized man-mole. Superman stops them to enter the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the well to return it to his companions. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some kind that they shoot at Jeff Corey (I call him an Aargh pistol because his only effect seems to be that Corey leaves "Aargh!") And Superman saves him. Immediately he changes his attitude due to the astonishment that Superman has saved him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men return by the well. The end. <br /> <br /> Although the film only lasts an hour, there is an inordinate amount of crawling, caring and chasing. I have omitted all "Mole-Man 1 who crawl from A to B, looking to make sure no one is following him". The Mole-Men never get involved in any way, they do not have any dialogue, they just appear, they are persecuted and they come back. They look a bit creepy, but they are not the insect-eyed monsters that the city's reaction implies. <br /> <br /> Reeves is a good Clark Kent, a very hard reporter, much more than Phyllis Coates is quite indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible superman. Not only does the part not look (at least her hair is dyed black, which is a rather clear hair improvement that she wore in some of the TV episodes), the way she interprets it is wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to "take the stance" (what Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be the fists on the hips, not the fists in the ribs. And he plays Superman as a fairly strict and delicate schoolmaster: he does not actually move his finger in reproach, but he may well have done it. <br /> <br /> And Superman does a lot of walking (I say a huge amount, he's not really involved, and he runs a little.) He takes off and lands a couple of times, but he does not see himself in flight. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision like Clark, but no visuals to accompany him, in fact, the visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty shabby endeavor, fortunately the production standards in the television series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to invent stories that had something more of them. <br /> <br /> Something disappointing: I will not be looking again
