I do not remember a movie in which I cared less about where the characters come from, what happens to them or where they are going. I realize that Hollywood's greatest pastime is to look at the navel, but these people are too despicable or too boring to take the time. For what it is worth, however, the discussion that followed the presentation, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, allowed the three women to possibly show some redeeming characteristics. I do not agree.
