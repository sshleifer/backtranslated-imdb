I confess: Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the best novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is, at best, a palimpsest. <br /> <br /> The comparison with the version of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable, that version is much more faithful to the ingenious spirit of the book and much more pleasant to see. <br /> <br /> Here are some good elements: Kate Berkinsale (who previously played with Flora Poste on Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's most intelligent spiritual twin). She's a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is attractive, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several important problems. The first is Mark Strong. First of all, it does not seem right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role as a Victorian censor parish priest. It is poorly detuned. <br /> <br /> The second problem is a long one. In short, the film is too short: to have the right feeling, it would have to be double. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream: all the dialogue is already there. It just needs to be trimmed and properly fixed. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a pretty grim movie, and the last thing Emma should be is grim. More importantly, Davies has considered it appropriate to rewrite the ending as a kind of bucolic banquet. From what planet, or lesser work of Thomas Hardy, does this come from? It is completely out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I think it's hugely presumptuous to try to improve perfection. <br /> <br /> Look at Paltrow's version, or look at Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
