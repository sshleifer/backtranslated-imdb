What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows baseball scenes, at least make the action look a bit realistic. Why was the crowd always standing for no particular reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie ... what was that? Somehow, they lead us to believe that DeNiro has found his way on the field in the uniform of a referee, and that the game is being played even in a torrential downpour ... one of the worst scenes of a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10.
