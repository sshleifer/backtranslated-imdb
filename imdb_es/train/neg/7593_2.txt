I do not like this movie, but I did not really like the book that, although praised by many as a "masterpiece", it seemed to me that it lacked character development and was disjointed and illogical in the plot, although it was much more readable than the Fante's terrible first effort "Road to Los Angeles" was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-'80s. <br /> <br /> I was intrigued to see what kind of soup Towne would make with so few ingredients. He has worked hard on scripts to repair the many deficiencies of the book, but for my money I did not rescue him. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust, while he always tried to stay true to the book. I consider this movie Towne's madness. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgettable.
