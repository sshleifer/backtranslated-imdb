What are people talking about here? I must have seen a different movie from you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What about this? I just laughed once and not even so hard. Whoever illuminates this movie should be taken to the streets and beaten. Usually, I always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. It is classified there with garbage as "Body Shots", "With Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people when they left the theater as a sign of apology, but to my dismay that was not happening. It seems I will never see that money again or the two hours.
