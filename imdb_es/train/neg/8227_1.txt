I will keep this fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home after a soccer game decide to take a 'shortcut' that takes them along a desert road full of forests. Of course, only good things happen to them and they arrive at their destination safely. <br /> <br /> It's okay, it's not like that. Soon they are chased by a deranged girl who has some serious mental problems, and what follows is 90 minutes of sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope I never see any of these actors in any movie anymore. Their voices that shouted and shrieked gave me a headache, and the script was so badly written that it included many repeated phrases and hysterical screams without meaning. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've seen ... and I've seen many.
