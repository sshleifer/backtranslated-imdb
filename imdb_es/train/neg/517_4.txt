"The return of Chandu" is remarkable, if you can say that, by the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero instead of the villain. Why does he even keep the girl? <br /> <br /> The story as such, involves the Cult of Black Magic of Ubasti, trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delightful Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice as a means of reviving her ancient leader who looks like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to frustrate the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and a large amount of archival material. The fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes. The acting is for the most part, horrible. The actor who plays the high priest (I think Lucien Prival), for example, uses the pronunciation inspired by the interim coach that was so common in the first talkies. The less said about others, the better. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in the independent revolutions at this stage of his career, because he was still a profitable star at Universal at this time. Maybe it was because in this case he had to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career began to decline in the late 1930s, this type of rate would become the norm for Lugosi instead of the exception. <br /> <br />
