Birthday Girl does not know what she wants to be, it's a comedy, it's a drama ... she just does not know. What could have been a very funny or moving movie ends up in no man's land. The premise is original enough to justify a script full of interesting scenarios, but offers almost none and ends up running out. This is a real shame if you look at the cast: it is very solid until the end, but they do not have the opportunity to shine. Very disappointing.
