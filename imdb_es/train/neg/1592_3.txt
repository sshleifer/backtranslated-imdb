To intensify the drama of this history of maternity in nursing, it is established in a special room for "difficult cases". The main story is of Loretta Young; She is on leave for a long stretch of prison for murder. Will doctors save their baby at the cost of their lives or will they pay attention to their husband's plea on the contrary? Melodrama and feeling are dominant, and they are not the honest type, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho ward next to the maternity ward, and allows a woman with a hysterical pregnancy to wander about the theft of babies. <br /> <br /> There is enough laughter and sarcasm for this to be recognized as a Warner movie, mostly by Glenda Farrell, who drinks gin from her hot water bottle while waiting to have twins who, to her chagrin, He finds that there is now a law against selling. An example of your case: "Be careful". Farrell: "It's too late to be careful". Aline MacMahon is, of course, wonderfully licensed as a nurse chief, but do not expect to be given a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby makes everyone go crazy. . Even given the obvious limitations, this movie should have been better than it is.
