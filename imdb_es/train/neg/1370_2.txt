**** WARNING: here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my years fleeing hastily seeing trash like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worse direction, and we have not reached the stage yet. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The hero expert fights stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. An avalanche is triggered, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive despite going through all kinds of dangers of suspensions. Corrupt partner who caused everything to be fried alive along with your payment money. Second avalanche deviated heroically by the adventurous experiment of the renegade expert. In the end, the evil minions also have a heart. Troubled teen falls into her crusty stepmother's arms after being saved by her. Etc, etc, etc, etc, goes on and on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are few reasons to warn spoilers. You could probably work on the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, it was not too far from most of the time, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we have not discussed the errors of fact. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier commentator that although there are usually SOME tradable features even from a bad movie. It would be hard to find any in this one. I guess I gave him 2 out of 10 for some beautiful landscapes shots, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since a movie made me moan, but it certainly did.
