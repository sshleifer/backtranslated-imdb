This is the worst movie I've seen in the cinema! I could not wait for it to end. To make matters worse, he is given a 12A certificate so that he does not see anyone being shot, only the bodies falling to the ground, even Babban who killed him was eliminated. Too many scenes were cut to attract younger viewers, since I believe the creators knew that it would fail disastrously! The Amitabhs performance was great, but the aspiring 'Basanti' and the other idiot who plays his partner Devgans can not act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would never see this for free and I advise everyone who reads this to do the same thing. YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED!
