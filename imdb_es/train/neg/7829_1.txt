The beginning of the 90s brought many "extravagant" and "out of rhythm" independent films, a particular subgenre of which is the semi-spiritual desert crime movie. Others of the note are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn", and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good movies like those garbage generated like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns the Radio" and this inept-surrealist masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It is a comedy that points to a certain emotional tone, it succeeds, but it continues to reach the point of irritation. While Chris Penn's search through the spiritual world of the desert is a good idea, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and it's not focused enough on the laughs to be really a comedy. I will not blow the ending, but let's say it's bad. The movie is basically a bad side effect of gender cancer. These are the feces of indie-mania.
