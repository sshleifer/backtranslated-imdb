I see that some people involved in this debacle wrote comments to share their version of the story, and I thought that what they wrote was useful to understand. The fact that they have basically found excuses (rewrites, budget constraints, production formats, etc.) simply underscores how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in the panorama are not directed personally, but simply a warning that this is not enough. <br /> <br /> It's visible, but just like that. There are screen holes in each corner, the dialogues border on the ridiculous and the end is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram that interacts with a reconnaissance team is drowned in stupid dialogues, like who makes a meal in the middle of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Could you help us a little to Hamburger Helper Sally, among those who kill us these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently, this elite team equipped with the latest gadgets and a red plastic tubular wonder armor does not have access to MRE. Once they reach the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting area. <br /> <br /> The basis of the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that you can not kill alone. . However, just one scene ago, the hero who made the case left King to do exactly that. Eh Vivian Woo was attractive and undoubtedly the best character in the movie. But that does not say much.
