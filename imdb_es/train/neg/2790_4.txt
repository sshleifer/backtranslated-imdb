Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their young son Alex to spend a couple of days with their family on Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple hopes to solve their problems over the weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of illegal immigrants is living on the island. The reckless Peter smoked a pot while driving the truck at night and turned off the headlight to show it; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as compensation for his lost son. The Young family does not accept the exchange, and they initiate a mortal war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie, with a stupid script, an amateur cinematography but a surprisingly good performance. The faulty story is totally absurd, and there are many incredible situations. For example, how could two men leave two women with the baby alone on the road during the night with the threat of the family upset? The logical procedure would be to go immediately to the continent and take the police force to rescue Peter. Then the young family vanishes; Julia and Steven leave their car on the mainland and their house and friends, and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia Alex when he arrives with the boat at the beginning. There are so many flaws in this movie that I could spend many lines writing about this topic. I think this movie was filmed with a domestic video camera, because of how horrible the images are. The good cast deserved better material to work with. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of Blood")
