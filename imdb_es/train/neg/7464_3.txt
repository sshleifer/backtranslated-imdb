I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching it for half an hour and I suggest that anyone who thinks of looking at himself stop before taking the disk out of the case. <br /> <br /> I like the tragic and comic mafia movies, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic mafia comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano simply tries to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely exaggerated and lacks subtlety or credulity (all his strange manners are considered suitable), Chris Kattan is clearly "acting" instead of assuming a role; He says goodbye to history. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comic event" that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies like Mr. Bean, the disasters caused by the title character are fun because you can empathize with the motivations and the initial event of the characters and the situation in which the character ends is not telegraphed. However, Corky gives the impression that he is making a mistake in a desperate attempt to make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> If Chris had not played such a strange character (who never really connects with the other characters in the film) and whose behavior is totally inexplicable (except for trying to draw laughter) and the scenes of comedy were not so predictable and stereotyped (all jokes seemed too familiar) this movie could have been visible. But is not. Do not look at it
