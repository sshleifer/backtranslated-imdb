I considered myself quite melancholic, especially when I watch great and moving movies. But not for this (what surprised me!) And I'm also surprised to see how many people praised this film so much. <br /> <br /> There are several troubling facts throughout the film: 1. Despite the guilt The real intention of Ben to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this kind of action suicide. Some people may perceive that this is a heroic action and others think that it behaves in a cowardly way, in the end, this was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The storyline of the film is too dramatized, but the logic is too simplified. Medically, the blood type is required to be an organ donor. Towards the end of the film, we learned that Emily had a blood type that limited her chances of obtaining the donor in a short period of time. However, it seemed that Ben had the rare type of blood, the same as hers, which allowed him to be his donor and, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also your kidney, your cornea. and his bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only a compatible blood type but also a tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the jellyfish poison he used to commit suicide? <br /> <br /> It is possible that you are over analyzing the whole story, since after all this is just a movie. However, it is to be expected that some of the disturbing facts described above will help you reconsider your plan to watch this movie. If you like a telenovela type movie, do it. But if you are looking for smart entertainment, do not miss it!
