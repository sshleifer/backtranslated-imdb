After watching this movie, I felt the urgent need to vent a little of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous actress, currently underestimated, and Max Beesley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. However, none of that mattered ... not at all. <br /> <br /> I do not know what your deal is, but the director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. He slowed down the footage, accelerated the footage, reversed the footage, used cumbersome camera angles, used annoying color filters, made thousands of quick cuts, jumped from side to side on the timeline and finished it off with a "modern" soundtrack. "unpleasant. I can not remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a movie. Your ego must be huge to get rid of the acting and the story and put your address in front and center so that audience members will notice. They are crammed in their throats. <br /> <br /> In "Kill Me Later" there are a couple of good scenes that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things were beginning to be promising, Mrs. Lustig looked in her bag of tricks from the film school and mixed things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could say that the movie really had a good heart. 3/10
