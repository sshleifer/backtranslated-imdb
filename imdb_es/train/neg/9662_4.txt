I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I did not before seeing TLB, and I must say that I was very surprised to see the average rating higher in IMDb. I thought I had a total lack of history. You just drop into it (and, unfortunately, not in the way that Saving Private Ryan included us in the movie), and it also has a sudden ending, which was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers seemed quite realistic, especially considering the low budget. But be prepared to laugh ... Some guys are being thrown into the air after an explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew in the air or a somersault during World War I is too much for me, especially when it's done countless times during the movie ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really made me laugh up almost mourn It was the scenes that contained close combat. The German voices that screamed and shouted ... incredibly funny. It seems as if they were spoken by a single actor / voice actor, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except to people who just want to laugh at the sad and cheesy quality.
