Truly one of the most terrible movies I've seen in my life. I never took the time to write one of these, but I felt compelled to do so after witnessing this affront to making movies and I feel a little bad for wasting my time in such a place to be honest. There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of meaning (for example, when would the police force shoot people with infectious diseases?) When would hospitals cross these people for lack of cure? Did he see him? He was spying on his wife wandering outside in her dressing gown while carrying a gun while she turned on the bed?). In addition, the characterization, as we can almost expect in those films, was horrible (eg, The way the blonde, I do not remember his damn name and I do not care about anything) turned completely against his girlfriend and I ran out to leave her ) And I ended up wishing everyone would meet with spooky ends! The production was horribly disconnected and the cinematography was nothing special.
