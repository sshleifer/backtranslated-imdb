Another of the first Alfred Hitchcock films that seems to have been made by contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paycock, it can be said that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or trade. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who enters money and embarks on a cruise that proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily is given the opportunity of a new life with a rich, good-hearted man who falls in love with her, but decides to take the higher road and stay with her husband. This might seem more credible if Fred was not made to be a completely insensitive and pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the film lacks a true scene of reconciliation. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry makes a very touching performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's all you can say about this.
