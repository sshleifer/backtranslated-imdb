The British industry of "heritage cinema" is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they be filmed by anyone without talent? This film breaks the bowels of Orwell's hard novel, turning it into a fluffy and inoffensive romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget his excellent description of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only cold and hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold and ruthless city, and Comstock prays for it to be destroyed by a squadron of bombers. But this film solves anything that might be disturbing in some way and, instead, creates a very nostalgic journey to the charming London of the 30s, where everything is illuminated with rays of golden light, and even the poor neighborhoods of Lambeth. They are picturesque and full of freshly washed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the strong wind sweeping the streets strewn with garbage seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all is the untiring bonhomie of the script, the old jokes and the clunking dialogue. It's very frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But everything is for nothing. This movie made me so angry! The literary history of Britain is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with that? We employ no one to be bland so that it becomes an anodyne and soft-center role for people who want to feel they are "acquiring some culture" while they drink their Horlicks and fall asleep in silence.
