The noble effort of Guy Ritchie is beaten, knocked down, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spat, beaten, sodomized and mistreated, and killed by Madonna's terrible performance. His performance was very reminiscent of a graduate of the School of Dramatic and Public Speaking Al Gore. Guy Ritchie made a pretty noble attempt to remake this, and if you exclude ALL the scenes his wife was in, it's a fair movie at best. I think the best acting job of all time, it had to be that Guy would comfort his wife that her performance was good enough not to shoot again. If you have the opportunity to observe Swept Away or trim your toenails for 89 minutes ... go for the extended pedicure.
