This barely visible movie was a bit difficult to pass. None of the segments is good, but at least the first was slightly fun, and the medium was somewhat imaginative. The last one was simply brutal, and after going through two weak comic shorts, the third was really painful to watch. Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, it seemed especially boring and sad.
