I wish I could give this movie a zero of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came to light, I came to IMDb to see the comments. A comment called the predictable and cheesy movie with terrible dialogue. I never take the opinions of other people, so I wasted seven dollars on this fucking movie. It had to be one of the worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have funny scenes? I swear, I am surprised that there is no moment of GROUP DRAG ^ ^ ^. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I went to the area, thinking about my research work for English. The clich√©, the birds / cats came out of nowhere when you THOUGHT something was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said: "I have to get my mom's shawl!" Your. Moron. Screw the shawl! Safety is only a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (which does not match the dress, by the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it off, they take her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the WHOLE movie. And not just the ones, I bet he hides under the bed, moments. It was the "He stole the clothes of the bellhop and ran away from the hotel" and "It's the detective who comes down the hall, not the killer!" Moments Movies should NEVER be THAT predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to complete my tirade saying it was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see the theaters so I would not buy them for $ 15.00 and then hate them. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after the detective had shot him, the killer would have fallen in the same position in which he was shot. With the knife in his hand, falling and stabbing the girl on her way down. Oh, how beautiful it would have been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
