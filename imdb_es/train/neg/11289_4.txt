Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (now they have pills for that!). It's probably the weakest element of this show. It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series: the immortal hero meets another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is a bit of conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap sequence of effects special <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unshaven hero of the 90s, with the typical story of "sexual tension". (Seriously, why do Hollywood guys think sexual tension is more interesting than sex?) This was a joint Canadian / French production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York, and the other half is in Paris ... Just like Highlander did.
