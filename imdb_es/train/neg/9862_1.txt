I could not believe it when I put this movie on my DVD player. I thought I would have a lot of fun, since I have played D & D for half of my life. I had to turn it off because I had company and they wondered what the hell I was seeing. <br /> <br /> I finished it later, and I should have left it in gay clown porn. the beginning. No, they cover the whole gamut of jokes, jokes, incest, racism, dressing up like KKK ... This movie is simply for anyone who has played D & D. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised it looks like this. Real D & D would not let them use their game. Who would want your name attached to this?
