A question for you: a family goes to a new house and is harassed by demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Every horror movie you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I will reduce it by saying that there are many scenes of anguish among teenagers. Does not help? Well, there are many fragments in which the characters are harassed by a creature and you can see them through the creature's point of view. Is not there later? Okay, is there a sequence of dreams with a lot of blood? It could be any horror movie you say. Oh, sure, this could take weeks, so I'll say that the movie I'm talking about has characteristics of many Australians, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBORS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, it is true, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (also known as CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the previous exercise is about? It is about me pointing out that THE THIRD CIRCLE is not different in any horror movie that has been made.
