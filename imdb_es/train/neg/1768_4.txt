This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good: the immortal cats that kill to live, etc., a kind of variation in the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> What makes everything fall apart is the total imprudence of the main characters. . Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive. Look how long it took to catch the Unibomber, and that was because a member of the family discovered it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the children (and, to a lesser extent, the mother) behave as if they were untouchable. The child kills without thinking about leaving no evidence or a living trace or witness. How these people managed to stay alive and without being discovered for a month is incredible, let alone decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame, this could have been much more if it had been written plausibly, that is, giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to survive for so long. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's not a bad presentation. I loved the final part, where all the cats of the city converge in the house: every time I put the food on the porch and I see our cats that come suddenly to wherever they were, I think of that scene.
