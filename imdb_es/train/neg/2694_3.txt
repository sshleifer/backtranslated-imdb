Warning: Contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This confirms the previous theme. The second scene constitutes the turning center of all the action. The fact that we know the ending makes the film boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story comes and goes several times. And this made him more frustrated. To compensate for the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the characters are. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a junkie, more? Is he cheating on his wife, more? Does he plan to steal from his father, more? Is his wife cheating with his brother? do not? Do not you regret your complicity with your mother's death, more? Is it a serial killer, more? Here, etc., there is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how I could have a good job. And why his wife did not leave before. On the other hand, I really enjoy the performances of actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent for this nonsense. Why absurd? Because it does not make sense, why should I take care of the despicable characters? Another broken slogan is that a movie should have a sympathetic character (at least pleasant). <br /> <br /> It is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we are supposed to take care of the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the life of the parents before the crime.
