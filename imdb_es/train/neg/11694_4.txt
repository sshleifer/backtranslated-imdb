So 'Thinner' ... Yes ... This book by Steven Bachman (read Steven King) about a man who gets his just desserts from an old gypsy who has just been killed. The story itself is there, there's no doubt about that, but I do not know why I did not enjoy it more than I could. I guess what really distracted me were the actors. I mean, who is the leader? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And as much as screaming, can anyone stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every role of Italian mobster that ever existed? And while we're at it, do all the mobsters have to have an Italian mother to cook pasta? The only work of good acting that is done here is less than 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the old gypsy. He is quite good. But the rest, I make you all, "better actors ...".
