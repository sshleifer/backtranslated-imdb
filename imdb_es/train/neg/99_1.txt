Some movies that you raise by one pound turn out to be pretty good: the 23rd century movies released dozens of dark Italian and American movies that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci movies, among others, most of their production sucks like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not as annoying as the stench of meat. Apart from that, it is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a donkey. <br /> <br /> It has been seen elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that inserts previews of the action in your credit sequence, so when it comes to zombie attacks, you'll have seen it all. <br /> <br /> Fans of bad movies will have fun observing the 18,000 continuity errors and diabolical performance. of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, which was so bad that it made me laugh a little), and congratulations to Hardgore for getting into the spirit of things by throwing such a bad impression that I felt like I was seeing a beating. of a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible things. We've all done things like this when we've got a camera, but common sense prevails and these movies languish in our closets somewhere. Avoid.
