Camp Blood III is a great improvement in Camp Blood II, since it sounds mainly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. This time they have ventured a bit further away from the parking lot where the other two films were filmed, which is a good move, since you can no longer hear the cars going through what is supposed to be a remote desert. <br /> <br /> This time there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare the participants. This is not a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise in which the real killer appears, but at least this one has a plot instead of people being stabbed at random with a knife. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this is at least good for a few laughs. I liked the way there is a bullet sound effect when someone is stabbed from the beginning and the way the microphone boom looms behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone would want to do a third Camp Blood. Movie, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they have tried with this. The half naked and deformed woman was too much for me, it seems that they tried to maintain continuity by hiring some monster that would take off their clothes for $ 5 as they did in the second movie. They have not yet discovered that a machete is used to cut, not to stab, but hey, it's a Camp Blood movie, what are you waiting for? If you like fucking movies, you'll have a little fun with this one.
