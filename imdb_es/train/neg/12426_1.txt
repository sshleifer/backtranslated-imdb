Whoever thought that another Home Alone movie would be a good idea, should have his head examined ... The same plot, another child, more villains (leading to MORE endless stupidity in the traps). The other two films were bad enough, and this is where it hits rock bottom. People can also watch the other movies in search of the plot, since everything is identical.
