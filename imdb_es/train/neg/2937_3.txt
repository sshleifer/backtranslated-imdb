An attempt to crossover to attract those who do not appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the best opera singers of all time, fails badly. All that is desirable in this film is opera, and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around an affair with a doctor who heals his throat, which has suddenly become problematic. <br /> <br /> Just because it came out so long ago, largely forgets. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a presence on stage apart from his talent as a singer, and nothing he does in this film denies that opinion. His guilt lies in not rejecting the horrible script. Maybe because the great operas can have silly stories, he tolerated them. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? We need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and trite. This film is like walking through a cold mud to catch some juicy gossip (the music of the opera) that hang over the mud. We have other ways of appreciating the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just get one of his magnificent recordings of opera or vocal concerts and recognize the tenor master in which he adapts most. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst movies of IMDb if more people remembered it and gave it something. votes; It would fit perfectly into a list that includes various efforts of singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through cinema. Very often everything goes wrong due to an incompetent performance or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he had not shown such a magnificent voice. As effective as he is as an actor (the opera requires it), Jimmy Stewart could not have rescued this turkey from a script. <br /> <br /> I give you an educated 3 out of 10 because someone may have become a fan of The Pavarotti Song and the Opera because of this movie.
