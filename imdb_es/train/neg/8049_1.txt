A warning not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is pointless and unattractive, and it often made me think of a Twain phrase about wanting all the characters to drown together. When someone takes the category of the worst movies ever made, it is not like "Plan 9" or "Attack of the Krew Shrews" in what I think; It's like this. What a waste of time, mine and everyone involved in this movie.
