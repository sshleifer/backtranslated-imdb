Too much of something borrowed Grade B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in theaters of all years. Because of this, film studios tend to avoid publishing movies with a bigger budget that weekend. Every few years, a studio releases a biased female counter-programming film ("The Wedding Planner" of 2001) to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend similarly titled "The date of the wedding" will try to find success and attract viewers who are not watching the game. <br /> <br /> Sick of people who feel sorry for her, unmarried, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, "Will and Grace" of television) hires male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to that is made happen through her. Boyfriend for his sister's wedding in London. Her family has been giving her a hard time for not being married, and her seven-year-old fiancé, who left her without a reason, is the best man. To make him jealous, Kat parades Nick around his ex to make him see what he's missing. But, ultimately, Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The movie lends itself too much to similar wedding movies. It is almost a carbon copy of "Picture Perfect" from 1999 and is mixed in scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding". The film also has a reverse theme of "Pretty Women" and, knowing their audience, the director makes intelligent references to that and other films. <br /> <br /> "The Wedding Date" has all the cliché elements of A typical wedding movie, is the stereotyped dominant mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and practically plagiarized wedding speeches from the family and friends at the wedding dinner and rehearsals. The turn in the end has been done before, but it was something that was not completely expected. The real reason why Kat was kicked out is a surprise and changes the direction of the movie during the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Even though "The wedding date" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. . Debra Messing, in her first leading role, proves she can be charming and fun. Dermot Mulrony has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too cheesy and unrealistic. He is able to do the best he is given, and be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> By the use of many intelligent (often sexual) word games, the movie is really fun. Although mainly a chicken movie, the film has components that everyone can enjoy. The story of Feel Good and humor make it the best dating movie released in a long time.
