A bloody maniac with cannibal tendencies rapes a woman. Two policemen have shot him and then he gets up from the grave due to some kind of satanic ceremonial rite performed by an evil heresy. The hunting of women continues for this zombie-demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac to die again, but only with the help of the police this will come true ... <br /> <br /> A bloody disaster of 65 minutes ... Horny zombies , doll -Babies, S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, repentant heretics seeking refuge from Jesus Christ and three text screens at the end of the film explaining what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we should know!) .. Two decent landing shots can not save the situation. I've seen worse horror movies, but this one was also pretty bad. Recommended only for fans of the genre.
