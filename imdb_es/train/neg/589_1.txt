Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because I had a rating of 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, since I am a movie fan, I have seen many brutal movies in my life (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this film was by far the most disturbing and brutal image I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply stupid, the direction is horrible, the acting was mediocre, even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There is not a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to bear. (Especially in the scene, where the embryos in the glasses are seen and the cry of the baby is heard: horrible). I do not understand why the film was 16 in Germany, where usually the criteria are really difficult (for example, kill-bill (brutal but mocked of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and, in addition to a great address) even a movie As a state of grace has a rating of 18). Nobody can call this a Horror movie, because in reality it was more about showing blood than about scaring the audience (Showing the face of "Creep" in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); For me (excuse my expression) is just an insane director who lives his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes violence is seen, that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or explains anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, honestly, I can not mention a single positive aspect of the film, except the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would. Ban this movie from the movies, I understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap. <br /> <br /> I look forward to receiving comments on my subject and would love to discuss about one or another topic. <br /> <br /> "Living the baby's dream, living the dream" David Aames
