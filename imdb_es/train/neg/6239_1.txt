Where was your criticism of the democratic and republican administrations? After all, he served for more than 17 years in a governing body where his influence was unwavering. Oh, I forgot about the 8 years he was the second in command of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is pleased to show images of a young Gore senator who asks why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper, but does not ask about Clinton / Gore's complicity in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or perhaps it would hurt Hillary's chances in '08. Either way, he is a political coward and a party man until the bitter end. It does not offer criticism of consumerism, nor criticism of capitalism, nor is it the history of industrial development that has brought us to this point in time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a campaign movie, play it and call it what it really is.
