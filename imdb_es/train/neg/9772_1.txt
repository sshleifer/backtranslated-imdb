Too many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another, and in almost all the violence explodes. <br /> <br /> Now I am not one who is shocked by violence, and for me a movie without a fight has something missing. But, please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is something akin to a story between scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the way through the movie I had turned off completely, and I could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best thing filmmakers can do is find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.
