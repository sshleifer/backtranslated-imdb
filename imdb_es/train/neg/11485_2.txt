Forbidden Siren is based on the game Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s). Like most video games converted into movies, I would say that most do not translate very well into a different medium. And that is also painful for this. <br /> <br /> There is a rather long prologue that explains and establishes the premise of the story, and the mysterious island in which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, his daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and his son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) enter to move. The villagers do not seem very friendly, and soon good advice is given on the siren on the island, so that they remain inside once the siren starts to sound. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, things start to blow, and our brothers go on a mission around to discover exactly what is happening on this hostile island with its strange inhabitants. But, in truth, he will not bother what is happening, since folklore and fairy tales are thrown to convulse the plot even more. What really pushed him into the world of bad comedy are his unconsciously misplaced moments outside the norm, which simply provoked unfortunate giggles for his sheer stupidity, until it is explained much later. It is one thing to try to present something intelligent, but another thing is convincing and with gaps covered. <br /> <br /> Even though it's less than 90 minutes, I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark: it gives you the feeling of almost two hours with your Slow build up to say what you want. Things start to improve in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of too little too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes tactics and its revelation at the end. Again, this is a common device that is used to try to turn a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little more in hopes of captivating the audience. It was quite satisfying, but it leaves a bad taste, since you will feel cheated a bit. There are two ways in which a turn will make you feel: raise the film to a memorable level or it will give you that feeling of a joke. Unfortunately, Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> Salvation will be your cinematography with the use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be explicitly. Still not worth it, so better. To avoid this.
