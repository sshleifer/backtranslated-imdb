You know that a movie will not turn out well when John Carradine narrates (a.k.a. reads the synopsis of the script and the plot) about the funerary procession of his character, just 5 minutes from the movie. The narrative is the last will and testament of his character. It stipulates that your estate be divided among your 4 children and servants. Children should split $ 136 million equally, but if any of them should die, that part is divided among the waste. If all the children die, then it is divided among the servants. To be eligible, they must live in the family estate for a week. It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext regarding the nature of the deans. They are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of that dog. From John Carradine's voice-over, he hopes that this film will lead to a Machiavellian cat-and-mouse game with a sinuous ending. <br /> <br /> That trip is painfully slow and meaningless. We wander for minutes watching the people sitting, playing pool, throwing darts, the improper use of the shot "through the fish tank", dramatic conversations between men wearing silk ties, constant disputes, lost circus music, strange flashbacks that remind us a false German. Expressionism, the aesthetics of terror of the fourth degree and a lot of dramatic overacting. All this inevitably leads to the expected and not rewarding end. You will be happy to stay alive, but the pain may be too great to bear alone. Share children, share. <br /> <br /> -cellulosic rehabilitation
