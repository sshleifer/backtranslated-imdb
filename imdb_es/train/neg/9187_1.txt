['I&#39;ve seen some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie. If the production team had turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of doing it, because surely you have to have a mental death to enjoy it. <br /><br /> I am a fan of most genres and I enjoy &quot;shoot&quot; games, but merging the nonsense of the game just made this look ridiculous and could not be seen. <br /><br /> As most have already said, there was almost no script and the performance was weak. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /><br /> Anyone who qualifies this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega, or else they have a very distorted entertainment concept. <br /><br /> I must say that I was more upset with the video store, who made a sign of approval, which led me to rent it. Thank God, I had a second movie to watch to restore some of my faith in the movies. <br /><br /> The comic boy would be right if he said &quot;The worst movie in history&quot;.']
