This "movie" is a farce. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT, this is undoubtedly the absolute WORST movie made with beloved characters created and established by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought of "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers it was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is an asin and money. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone begin to imagine that the appropriate updates for L & H would be in the personality of Bronson Pinchot? and Gailard Sartain? I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and ashamed and I certainly was not disappointed. All the people involved in this pathetic, moronic disgrace must be denied by anything and everything related to Hollywood and the cinema. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ANY COST, THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN.
