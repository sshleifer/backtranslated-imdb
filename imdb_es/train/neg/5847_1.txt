I enjoy the quality of shit, and this is among the best. the CG is out of this world, or at least it is prior to our world, and the madness of a 6-foot guy in a rat suit chasing people is ridiculously bad. I enjoyed this a lot, but the acting is so horrible, and even the obligatory nude scene does not have any problem. Just a complete waste of time if I ever saw one. I do not know who lost more time, I seeing this, or the poor sages who were forced to do so in the hope that this would launch their acting careers. I assure you, I will not. However, on a brighter note, I managed to successfully make the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon of this movie, so I think it was almost worth watching the 91 minutes of it.
