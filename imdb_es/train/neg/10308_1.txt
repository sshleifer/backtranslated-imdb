This is really very bad. Lamas shows how a second-rate actor does his work. But what makes it worth seeing is the scene in which OJ angrily grabs a fellow police throat as if to kill him while the jukebox plays a song with the lyrics "I have tests on you!". (I want to hear the rest of the lyrics, attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find them in iTunes). Talk about seeing the future ... Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgettable. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. Same as the sequel. Which raises the question of why they would do a sequel at all. As I understand it, overseas sales drive many of these movies. B It does not say much about the viewing habits of the world.
