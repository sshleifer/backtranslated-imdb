For the love of God please do not watch this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, just like the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with too little, this movie and its evil predictable villain is simply dumb. The characters are not developed, and most of the movie is completed with shots of Rome, which is much more interesting than the real movie. To top it all off, acting is a disgrace. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but this is really a disaster. I can not believe that someone has paid, however, many millions of pounds to put this movie on screen. Do not waste time or money on this movie, go see your grandmother or something worthwhile.
