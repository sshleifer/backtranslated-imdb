A good cast is wasted terribly in this comedy slower than molasses and random conspiracy. Peter Ustinov strives here to give something to life, but the result is a severe boredom that loses all the correct beats that could have made it visible. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this movie is horrible. Misdirected Badly edited Badly acted Badly written. You have to sit through a hundred movies to find one so bad. <br /> <br /> The confusing and terribly lagging plot concerns Ustinov on his way to an American insurance company to hack into his computer and embezzle millions of pounds. How he does it is beyond perversity and credibility (he simply learns his computer skills seemingly overnight reading some brochures, and tricks computer scientist Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity). <br /> <br /> As in the plot, Ustinov comments on the lonely Maggie Smith, who accidentally becomes his secretary by chance after receiving a floor in his building. She ends up sharing scenes that have a sexual background with Bob Newhart that is not going anywhere, while Ustinov tries to graft the money little by little and tries to stay one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which has become the basic ending of almost all of Caper's British comedies since (Nuggets on the run? A fish named Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The spin surprise of an ending It is more laughable than everything that came before. In the end, I was thinking that it should be really out of my reach to stand out like that. Even a Caesar Romero cameo did not help him. One of the least fun and little rhythm "comedies" I've seen in my life, and without a doubt the worst of our adventures. Do not waste your time. If you like this you need to see better movies.
