How did this scam of "Being there" become so loved? People say it is proof that a decent and honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong The film is proof that luck is everything: I hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not in Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one in the sea when a storm breaks out; I hope you do not die of shock when you are shot in the buttocks and not in the back; I hope you do not have AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary: all those who rebel against social convention lose their legs, use drugs, beat their girlfriends or die young. In addition, the placement of the product in this movie (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
