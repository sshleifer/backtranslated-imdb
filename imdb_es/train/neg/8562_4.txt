CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Monkey <br /> <br /> While visiting Rome, a loving nobleman (Nino) Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but his unlikely romance is opposed by the wealthy father of Castelnuovo (Massimo Serato), and Destino hits a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A sexed love story for the sixties, adapted from a literary source ("La Dame aux Camelias" by Alexandre Dumas) by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with a carefree style by Radley Metzger who, along with others like Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of "adult" cinema throughout the sixties and seventies. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the film's sexual frankness seems alarmingly timid for modern standards. The production values ​​are attractive at all times, and the performances are attractive and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite the weak dubbing after the synchronization. Although set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's extravagant designs firmly place the film within his period, and Piero Piccioni's wah-wah musical score has become something of a cult element among devotees. of exploitation. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant erotic style will not be disappointed. The next step for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
