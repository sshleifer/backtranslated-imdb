This is another depressing and boring movie about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very calm and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I kept waiting for him to pick up, but unfortunately he never did. The acting is fair, but the script needs a LOT of work. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these not-so-hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of subtitles, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gay movies, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you might find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your low-budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay movies I've seen in my life.
