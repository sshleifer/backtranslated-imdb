It really was so bad. Along with the television series "Dirty Dozen" of short duration (starring Ben Murphy) that was made almost at the same time (also in the cheap part of Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was ashamed for the cast members of this movie, and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the critic who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" sums it up quite well. <Br /> <br /> Other critics have pointed out some of the ridiculous howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so I will not repeat them here. But I will add that I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny helmet that Savalas has on his big, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that this knot in a movie has a rating as high as 4.7 here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" right on the other side of the board. If you want a good example of why it is really bad idea to punish a franchise to death (especially more than 20 years after the original), look no further, "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Horrible - avoid !!!!
