After waiting anxiously until the end, I must say that I wish I had not joined the whole series in the first place. The final episode was all against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let's say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? The crew members were dying during the entire trip. Why does she want to save Seven from Nine only? Do others not tell or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew claims that getting home is not really the most important thing for them. As it is said, "travel is more important than destiny". Amazing. And in the final scene they are surrounded by other ships of the Federation and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, getting back to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end of all.
