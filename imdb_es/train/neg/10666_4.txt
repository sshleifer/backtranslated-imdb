I'm a big fan of the 1930s movies and I'm going to see almost everything I see in Turner Classic Movies, that's new to me. So I tried this, after all, it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I've seen much less of the silent films of Lloyd and then of Chaplins, but I have to say that I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway, this movie fell so flat that I did not finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited that he did not have very good material to work with. After having seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy doing boxing parodies (or violence in general), this is very forgettable. I was also interested in seeing Adolphe Menjou when I really enjoyed it in Paths of Glory, but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into boxing before, because at least half of the movie (at least it seems that way) is before he enters a ring. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular criticism, but I must describe this compared to what I was at that time, 4 out of 10. Do not look at this with anyone you try. You like old movies. , since it is possible that they do not see another one with you, very flat. As an alternative to anyone who has really liked this or is looking for little-known comedies in general, I recommend "Kelly The Second" made a few years earlier, another person becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase . Both have been shown in Turner's classic movie channel.
