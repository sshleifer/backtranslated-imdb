Hollywood Hotel was the last musical film that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His style of direction had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his exclusive head shots or his huge production numbers with thousands of extras. In the late 1930s, the great swing-style bands were recording the biggest popular hits of the year. The Swing era, also called Big Band Era, dates back to 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to pinpoint exactly when the Swing Era began, the commitment of Benny Goodman at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles The summer of 1935 was undoubtedly one of the first signs that swing was entering the consciousness of American youth. When Goodman introduced his swing repertoire instead of the social style dance music that his band had been playing, the youth in the audience went crazy. That was the beginning, but given that radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the main methods available to spread the phenomena, it took a while before Swingh advanced enough to produce great hits that appeared in the hits. At the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and Raymond Paige and his Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the change in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half more or less after the commitment of Goodman's Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting musical moments here and there at Hollywood Hotel, but with the exception of "Sing, Sing, Sing" by Benny Goodman and His Orchestra, there is not much to recommend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening of the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and the production number of "Let That Be A Lesson to You" at the drive-in restaurant. The movie is more interesting to watch and listen to Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford to sing.
