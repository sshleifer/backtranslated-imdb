This was the worst Christmas movie I've seen. I took my two young children to see this. It was the darkest and darkest plot: the family has no money, the mother loses her job, the father is murdered in the bank, the bank robber steals the family car with the two children in the back and after the persecution at high speed, he takes them off the bridge and chokes them. in the river. Mom is completely alone. No wonder his Christmas spirit is gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children who have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead parents! I thought that this was the WORST message to send to children. It is better to tell them that there is NO Santa Claus than to show them a movie like this!
