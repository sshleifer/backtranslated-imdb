I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival 2005. Based on a novel by science fiction author Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, united twins who are stripped of their family by a businessman for form a rock band <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately gruesome, the movie is also too smart in half (if you forgive the play on words). By mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) are quickly lost. I was never sure if he was meant to take me all seriously or not. Flashbacks, sequences of dreams, everything was a bit too much. Also, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. They reminded me a bit too much in the moments of Hedwig and The Angry Inch, a film that I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not so good, nor did the main characters sympathize. A more unfavorable comparison would be the equally disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
