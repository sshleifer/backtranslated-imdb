This movie really, I mean REALLY, sucks. It has such large plot holes, and a 30-foot dragon can go through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image ever put into the real movie. I mean, when you see something like this, you have to be thinking, "Wow, somebody really made this movie, then threw it in. That has value." Whoever they are, I'm sure they do not work in the movie business anymore. <br /> <br /> When I hired this movie, it was not on a DVD, so I (reluctantly) took it out. The first thing that appeared was a trailer for The Lord of the Rings, for the Two Towers. This was a very smart move, put this trailer in the video. It justifies (reluctantly) giving the movie a star, otherwise it would have given it zero stars. Maybe the producers despite the star attraction of Dean Cain (I think that's how it is spelled) attract the crowd (uh, to the video store that is). <br /> <br /> Then they used the split-screen technique (as in Hulk) to (I guess) compensate for the atrocity of this garbage movie. On the top of the box, we see an image of our hero, and the dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like Dragonheart, or is it just me? Either way, the dragon in the film looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2, and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain of the early 90s (maybe worse). In addition, it is not the movement of the Dragons while chasing their victims, it is the same monotonous movement, right leg, left leg, right leg, sun, sun, sun DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! This only bothers me. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was exciting and would have the same effect as Jaws. Then, why not have a Dragon POV shot? Either way, that was just fun, like seeing a Weebl toon. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives him many puzzled looks during the movie (maybe his agreement with the fact that this movie could end his career). Do not wait for Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was a complement to a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so bad that my 5-year-old brother can improve. When he is not convinced he tries to lie about why he was playing in my room while I was not there. Oh, and did I mention that F @ # KING HAD THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS MOVIE? !!!
