How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason she seems really scared. I can understand your fear; for fear that this stinking third class was somehow released to the general public. Also, I'm a big fan of the nice Adam West. Again, just like with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age. His performance here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it is even difficult to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The movie is a scam from Brando's classic biker movie, The Wild Ones; The biker gang outside the law is out of control in a small town of Hick. The bikers here look like a motley crew and I would not want them to go out with my sister. The performance is rigid and wooden, and the plot is as old as sand. Hellriders is a hell to see!
