It can not be denied that Azumi's first film was a commercial product; It was an adaptation of a popular manga and had young and attractive actors, and certainly not missing in the budget department. However, it was more than entertaining for what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" lacks everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should sound the alarm bells is the absence of the magnificent Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his own visual and kinetic style, but the original style, beauty and, most importantly, his heart. While the first had a simple plot of "hit lists", this has the clutter of a story, with too many boring characters stabbing each other in the back so many times that the potential for sympathy or pathos is erased. The effective interaction between the main characters is over; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a group of teenagers arguing in a forest. The characterization is non-existent; If someone who looks really cares about who lives and who dies, I will be surprised. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle, in fact all the battles, is completely devoid of any kind of tension. The fact that they are badly choreographed and abysmally directed, not to mention a few and distant from each other, is bypassed by their own uselessness. The villains try too hard to be campers, and even if they were all combined, they do not come a mile from Pete Burnsian's antics of Jo Odagiri in the original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Important spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto does her best to say it, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition among the movies. Azumi is now a full-fledged assassin, which means she can move her sword in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is inculcated with a kind of mysteries of the Man Without a Name style, the aspect of Ueto's model becomes even more inappropriate. I know that this is supposed to be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the movie, the stupidity of the plot and the overall ineptitude of the film in general means that it is absolutely impossible to support your character this time. . The less said about Chiaki's performance "Remind me of Kill Bill," Kuriyama is better; Suffice it to say that his "turn" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> In general, this was just a colossal disappointment. Any merit was made ten times better in the first film. A lazy, unsatisfactory disorder and, in general, boring.
