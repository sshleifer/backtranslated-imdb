This movie was not as tense a task as I expected. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this paranoia-fest of hardcore UFO conspiracy a bit idiotic. Most of the performances are mediocre, but quite typical for things in the style of the 70 full of pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model witness some strange events in the forest and soon fall victim to these same events. Flying saucers are detected, more people disappear, but are they extraterrestrials or the top secret group of our own government of cover-ups? Very soon, a reporter and a "logistic UFO" (apparently inspired by the character of the writer-director) get involved in this fiasco and become the target of the top secret agents who are as threatening as they are improbable and ingenious. Then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The film, as expected, makes as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but it should be praised for taking it so seriously. Working with the camera is fine for a low budget movie, the pace is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity problems that are fun to watch. What are the few seconds of brilliance that I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is worth, at least, a fast breakthrough if you can not take half.
