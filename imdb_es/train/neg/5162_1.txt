This film reminded me a lot of "A History of Violence," which was intended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior, but ended up being a cheap action film masquerading as a reflection film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British wife move to a small English town and encounter the endless harassment of local drunks who do nothing more than hang out in the pub all day and cause problems. These men do not have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything he can take and at the end of the film holds at home and fights each of the drunken attackers by means as frightening as whiskey boiling over someone, kicking his feet with a shotgun and someone trapped in a bear trap. It's funny that someone would need such a big bear trap in a small British town, except maybe put a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who did the "Wild Bunch" that also covered the theme of Blood that leaves the violence in which nobody was saved. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw dogs is not credible. First, the location is incorrect and does not work. Why place it in England? I would think maybe somewhere in the city or in a small town in the southern United States in the 1930s or something. Second, to my way of thinking, I have never explained clearly why these men are so quick for violence, except that maybe they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah did not see the mark. this.
