This movie is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. But it's so cheesy that it's actually semi-mirable. That is SEMI visible. <br /> <br /> The story (what little there is) is practically meaningless at all. The character of Barney Drum is the only real comic relief in the movie and he gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian cast members can be found in TV commercials .. None of them happened to anything else that I know of. And, of course, the even less talented brother of Sly Stallone well ... = \ <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the small town of Claremont, Ontario. (approximately 20 miles northeast of Toronto) I recognized many landmarks / intersections / local buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed in the now demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was demolished.
