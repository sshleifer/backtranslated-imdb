wow, the band of the naked brothers. What should I say? I guess I can say that this show just sucks. Number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play the instruments. number 2: in the commercial he said they were famous, but nobody had heard of them until the shit show arrived. Look, I really do not hate it that much, I would give it as 4 out of 10, but what bothers me is that everyone says they have great talent and Nat is SO profound and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! Talk about unconditional fighters with internal feelings. Wow, I could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they did not become famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children to be so, so they invented a bad show. I have the feeling that it will be canceled soon.
