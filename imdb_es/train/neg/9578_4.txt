Can A-Pix ever, ever, do anything right? This movie was meant to be seen on television in a mailbox format. As A-Pix does not even believe in panning and scanning, we see full scenes in which a shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with a shoulder on the right side. Of course, it's not that you miss much. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie in which the characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80% of the movie without any reason.
