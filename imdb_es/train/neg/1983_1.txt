Oh, let's give people a break to this movie. The only thing I liked about this was ... I'm sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, I'm sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking about a movie of better quality. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yes, the girl who was Clueless was in it. Do not leave Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, something that has never been done in a western, even a female cast, actually hung a woman from the gallows. That could be a western first. Even though your neck should have been broken and you have survived the ordeal, still, you should give the director some effort to try a western in the first place. Also, I have never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, although that did not happen in this movie, I just thought that I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Wood's girlfriend of monster # 2. Maybe that's what the creators of this movie were looking for. Orginality, especially with a cast of African women and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you could have a lingo like: "Hey, do not worry about my friends" and "talk with your hand, baby, talk with the hand ". You could also have an assistant surfer-type marshal who says things like, "That shooting was TOTALLY a RAD man, totally." You know, things like that.
