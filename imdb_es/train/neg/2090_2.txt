I realize that it is not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow-paced programs if they are interesting, but I feel completely disinterested and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Soft drama + moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> It may become more interesting, but from episode 3 I can barely see it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my to-do list for the week. This is a sad situation. The Syfi channel really destroyed their lineup on Friday night. What happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday nights? They had something good there.
