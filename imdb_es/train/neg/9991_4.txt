First of all, I'm not here to pursue this movie. I find it totally nice despite the poor production quality. The performance here is as abominable as the monster that stalks them, though the monster itself is pretty well done ... impressively well done, that's all. In fact, he looks like an otherworldly guy, as if an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while Dad was out attending nature's call, Spot broke free and simply did not have time to catch him. That, or is the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster. I have not decided which one. <br /> <br /> Actually, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in the snowy country, yes, but it is more likely to be Canada somewhere than China anywhere else. The trees and the views tell me Canada, and it is fine that the established area never takes on the appearance or the sensation of super coldness that one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> In addition, apparently (as we just stated) Sci-Fi directors do not travel often, as they are not aware that commercial aircraft fly above the weather like what is shown in this document and the subsequent shock would not really have happened. But like I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty graphic at times, and it rotates between "Alive" on Donner Party, "Predator" on the alien in the forest, and any bad wushu movie where they fly over cables. The Yeti can apparently jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer!" <br /> <br /> In addition, the Yeti has lost its teddy bear. He has searched high and low, but it seems he can not make a corpse work. Poor Yeti! You can not help feeling sorry for it. It has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to the severe loss of teddy bears. He has missed his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but that thought is BANISHED! Can you hear me? Well, he seems to be a man without a partner. SLOWER <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But, again, what is normal-Yeti? I do not know, but he has a definite quality of Michael Meyers that is completely unsettling. And you have this fabulous way to cleanse your skin. Fabulous Dahlink! It is immaculately white at times when TAN should not be. He is annoyingly superhum ... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> Everything in everything? This was very fun to watch, it has some great murders and some honest elements of the plot. Despite the production style horribly similar to gravel, this is actually quite entertaining. I can not help but wonder if they are planning another one. <br /> <br /> Qualify a 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV Scale. <br /> <br /> Rate a 4.4 / 10 on the Movie Scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
