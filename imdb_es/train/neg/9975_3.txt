I remember seeing this movie several times as a very small child, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I saw him once as an adult, and then I understood those parts. The only problem with seeing him as an adult was that he did not entertain me at all. So, what kind of movie is this? Is it a "children's movie"? Is not difficult. It contains language and material not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what each parent feels is going on with their own children? Maybe, but then, why do not you focus more on the character of John Ritter instead of Junior? When a film has a 7-year-old as its main character, to be able to do well with its audience, it must be a film for the seven and under, otherwise the older people will not have a way to relate (even 8 children). a year they would not want to see a movie about a child that is a whole year younger than them, I'm pretty sure that this movie did not go well at the box office, and the reason has to be because it could not find a niche in the market .
