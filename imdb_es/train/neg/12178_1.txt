Annie's wig does not look good. She is not pretty and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie stands out in the movie, since her costumes look like Halloween costumes. Terrible performances and terrible plots. This movie is a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and younger girl should have played the lead role. Ashley Johnson plays a very childlike Annie. It is not attractive at all. At least the casting director did well with Daddy Warbucks. Ms. Hannigan was also a disaster. Camilla Belle played Molly well. "Warning" This movie may insult your IQ, so you may only want to show it to very young children. 8 and minors. Some of the frames are too fictitious and could hardly take place in the real world.
