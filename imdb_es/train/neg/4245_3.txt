This movie was based on real events? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We can see what appear to be numerous armed policemen who empty an equal amount of weapons in 2 guys who only have armored torso. It's a great idea; Point to the armor! ... excuse me, but what about those big, thick heads you can not get lost or your legs for screaming out loud? Or were there invisible tanks that protected them? Were they from Crypton? Did I miss something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started decent enough, but after 20 minutes of shooting, it really takes a turn towards the boringlane. <br /> <br /> And that documentary style did not work for me either, but that's something that you find pleasant or not. <br /> <br /> Incredibly incredible things that make it difficult to see until the end. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for the fine edition.
