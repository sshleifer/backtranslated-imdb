This is a shame for everyone and everything that is used to make this joke. Personally I do not care in one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever it is that many people find fascinating about her. Like a movie, this is something that would not even get a passing grade in film school. The script is a disaster, the acting is atrocious and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") did this makes me wonder what the hell I was thinking. He did "Old School" to scream out loud! This does not even belong to the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please, for whatever reason, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS! I see that there is a comment that this is so bad that it is good, but that, frankly, it is too kind. When will we stop seeing the singers who, obviously, can not act to keep trying? I hope it ends soon. The worst thing is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As for the plot, well, it's almost nonexistent and it's so badly done and written (yes, I know it's another rehash). I doubt anyone will remember anything about this. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved to waste time making this bomb. Jessica Simpson you're pretty, but stay to sing, but I'm not a big fan of that either. And whoever made this movie, I would not put this on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give a zero.
