Honestly, if someone has a brain, there is nothing positive to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 when renting this. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> all the actors must have been bored or not have fame at that moment. even Matthew Mc Conahay * as you say * was better than all the actors in this movie, when he played a psychopath in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you watch this movie and have something good to say, your IQ must be extremely low, with so Bad taste in the movies, it hurts. Thanks to you ... and the TRUTH, it has been said! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, now it's a classic.
