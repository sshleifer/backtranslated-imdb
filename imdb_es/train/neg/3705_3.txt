I like Chris Rock, but I feel like it's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he reedited them completely, so they became Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just new tepid versions. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better movie. The few laughs that come are when he's doing his routine standing, so he could very well have made a concert movie. It would also have been much more fun if the white man whose body he inhabited was a truck driver or a mound. So, why is Hollywood still making garbage like this? Because people are going to see it, because they like Chris Rock. Give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not redo movies that were not so good in the first place!
