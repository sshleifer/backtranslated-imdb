Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a Satanist / serial killer who possesses the "First Power": even after being captured by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit. Body to body and continue killing at will. With the help of the psychic attractive Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, the stepsister of Melanie G.) tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some possibilities, I think, but ultimately, "The First Power" suffers from writing routines and movie making. This is nothing that we have not seen before, sometimes better. There is nothing in this movie that distinguishes it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More specifically, it's not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell because he is a cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith does not seem to be trying hard; The best cast member is probably the Kober with distinctive features, doing his best to be extremely spooky. <br /> <br /> The climax is pretty silly and the ending is very weak. <br /> <br /> It really is not acceptable enough to qualify as an average movie of its type, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
