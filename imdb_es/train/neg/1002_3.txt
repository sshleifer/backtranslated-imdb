I do not want to delve into the details, because I can not really justify wasting a lot of time reviewing this movie, but I had to give an alternative opinion to help people avoid the movie. The animation is raw and the story alternates between dull / nonsensical and extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost in the audience, and yes, the fans of Ghost in the Shell, this is NOT a sci-fi action or anything like that, it's a slapstick comedy attempt, and the humor just did not work out after being translated. It was a total task to see this movie, and a horrible way to start the film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was to anything, I did not expect a Ghost in the Shell secel, but I expected something entertaining, and just He did not achieve this. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Kino's Journey instead.
