What a poor excuse to make the movie New Zealnd. I am ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is being played on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) on the whole, even in the ship's funnel. It is assumed that the ship is a cruise / ferry between the United States and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place, but it is supposed to be a luxury boat on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the southern island of New Zealand in the background for God's sake! It must have been a very cold weather in the EE area. UU / Mexico! The story is weak, the performance is weaker and the New Zealand / American accents just do not work. I hope that the New Zealand taxpayer has contributed to the production cost of this film and that it was a better waste of money spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There's a truck in the warehouse with labels and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, probably to make it look like it was American. But some of the signs are on the top of the label: one would think that they would have noticed that in the accessories department before placing them. I'd love to continue, but it's not worth it in any way.
