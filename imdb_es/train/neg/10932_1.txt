The really sad thing is that this supposedly was the highest budget with which "Halestorm Entertainment" has had to work. All those involved must be fined for littering, since all the celluloid they waste is not good for anything other than to fill garbage. Not only the writing is atrocious and the jokes horrible, but the camera work and the quality of the film are, at best, amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on a laptop of some guys. The worst of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I think that just because he could not believe that he had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater in which he was watching really agreed to show the "movie".
