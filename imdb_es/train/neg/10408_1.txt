If Fassbinder has made a worse movie, I do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that their films are too cunning and claustrophobic should be forced to see this, to learn to appreciate the more sober style that opted for excellent films like "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant". This film is stuck with so many artistic images, almost symbolic that it seems a parody of an "artistic film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene in which the prostitute friend of Elvira sails for what seem like ten minutes are just two of the most obvious examples of what makes this movie a real test of the resistance of the viewer. But what really annoys me about it are the few scenes that show only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments that show a real human emotion, and show that at the center of this horrible movie, there was an excellent movie that was struggling to break free. What a waste.
