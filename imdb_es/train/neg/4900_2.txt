SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten more minutes, ahem, 'extreme' images) in the UK in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a case of murder. Oddly enough, the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing film under the carpet in their hurried race to get the comparatively innocuous tastes of canned FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, and the film has been completely forgotten as a result. I took the opportunity to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the duration of the movie with my jaw on the floor. Not so much politically incorrect as completely insane, a triple-X version of Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (did the title give the game away when it comes to inspiration?) With hard sex and some really nasty violence thrown at a already bubbling beer of the seventy deafness. If you do not consider yourself delicate, this may force you to think again. When SEXWISH is finished, you will want to clean your eyeballs with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge. If any movie really deserves the label "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie", it's this one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lows): a rapist who uses a vibrator on a victim while masturbating on her, the mustache that steals the scene of Harry Reems, the defenseless young black couple who is forced to screw the sword cane killer (they would have won the Oscars for their totally credible performances if the Academy had gone mad) before the Man is castrated by his problems, and there is an alarming direction that threatens to elevate the process by above its obvious origins. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought that the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEXWISH will prove you very, very bad.
