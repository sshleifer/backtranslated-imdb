(There Spoilers) Miya, Kari Wuhrer, the homicidal homicidal nymph, takes charge of the virgin's life and car, even though he's too embarrassed to admit it, the collage's first-year students Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the movie, Myia not only diverts, but gives the poor and innocent Trent a lesson on how to detect a dangerous craze job and stay so far away for him or her, so as not to end up becoming one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around a trucker's rest stop, Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some heavy and strenuous action, in the backseat of his buggy. Roy is too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is none other than his estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to contact him, Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by Trent Colbert's freshman, who gets into the rest area hitting one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance, Miya gets into Trent's car and the two are in what turned out to be the rarest car chase ever put into a movie. When traveling throughout the Northeast of the US The two of them ended up in a truck that destroyed a murder and a shooting with the soldiers of the state that they then take to the parents' house in Trent, where they are taken hostage. It is there where there is another wild shooting between the crazy Miya with a whole SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state police. <br /> <br /> You would expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentional or involuntarily fun, but it is not. In fact, the film is very disturbing as to how Miya treats everyone in the film she comes into contact with even her pervert and Father Roy, who abuses children. Getting Trent to take her all over the Northeast Miya gets the poor bum drunk with him in a motel room, along with whips and a lighted candle. Miya also agrees with the owner of the motel, the horny Mr. Foster, tricking him into giving him his gun, as part of a strange sexual game. After holding Foster, she leaves with Trent, who ran out of money in his motel room, with a wallet with about $ 400.00, but does not bother to leave with his car. <br /> <br /> Needing the money to pay for gas to get home with her parents for Thanksgiving Day Trent receives a call from Miya from his cell phone to pick her up at a local restaurant to get her money back. Like the imbecile he is, Trent picks up Miya, who is now a fugitive from the law, and then gets involved with his father Roy on the open road while trying to get Trent and Miya off the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this desolate house of wear in which Roy chases Miya, running him down a muddy road in high heels, and entering with him where you know him, with an explosion of his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he forgot he left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With a mugging and a murder, as well as a blow and a run, charge them the two desperate stop at an S & M / Tattoo boutique where Trent pierces his ear and nose and dresses up Leather and chains, by Myri, along with a dog collar for him and her. This in order to meet your conservative and straight parents for the Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> After a shootout with state police officers, one of them ended up seriously injured, the two fugitives from the law ended up in Trent's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn at home with the All local police, with a SWAT team, waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> A detestable movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying to tell the audience. At first you felt a lot of sympathy for Miya, but as the movie progressed to its end, it evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubes in the Valley of Death. Even though Roy was the most unpleasant person in the movie at the beginning, when the movie ended, Miya eclipsed him completely.
