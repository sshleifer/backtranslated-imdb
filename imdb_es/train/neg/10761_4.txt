This movie was a disaster. I had the absolute worst edition I've ever seen. It was almost like at the end of a scene that the writer wanted to go to the commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the dream of the writers. <br /> <br /> Under the disorderly direction and editing, there was a ray of something good. A good idea, a convincing spark. But somewhere it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about an almost psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is difficult to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not require that he be a good priest and he does it quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the bad crazy. He always plays the bad crazy guy. Very ho hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, I came up with an idea that maybe the whole disconnected and horrible plot and the disconnected plot were trying to add a sense of confusion that the character (Grieco) was experiencing. And just to prove that it had been devised, they got rid of the passwords of the credits. It is not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
