Wow, here it is finally; The action "movie" without action. In a real low budget environment (do not miss the funny flying saucers that fly by several times) of a future Seattle, we found a difficult body for the brain that seeks to take revenge of its childhood. <br /> <br /> There's nothing. even remotely original or interesting about the plot and performance of the actors only compete with stupidity for the attempts to steal other films, mainly "Matrix" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we can see running on the walls and shoot in slow motion (45 seconds approximately), but these scenes are as cool as the stupid body's attempts to make jokes about male incompetence from time to time. <br /> <br /> And, yes, they have also served us a series of clues that lead nowhere, as if the script had been thought by the invisible cast before filming the scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as possible. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps it may cause some of you not to rent it and save your money.
