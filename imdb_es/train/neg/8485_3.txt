From the horrible scenes of death to the weapons that fire without making sounds to a character called the Devil. Everything is tired, slow movement, no sense of nonsense. It was good to see the boy with the cape and the hunchback hanging around. Visually, it was creepy and probably occupied the cinema of the time, but even in 1936 one would think there would have been a little more imagination and credibility even in a movie like this. I kept waiting for something important to happen when people stopped to give speeches and act as if they were posing at a picnic in the office. And then there are those bullets as mentioned by a previous commentator. Perhaps the best clue would have been to look for a point of water in the pocket of someone's pants.
