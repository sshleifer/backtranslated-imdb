Despite the overwhelming cult that follows this sad "documentary", I must admit that I hated cordially the film that our group found a piece of exploitation far more distressing than useful and informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent music scene taken from him, one can appreciate what the movie could have been in safer hands. <br /> <br /> One suspects that many of those who suffer actively through the film may have had some delight that their cruelest fanatics enjoyed destroyed by the uneasy suspicion that many of us, or those we know, are just one or two steps away from the pitiful situation of the two crazy women represented who live and contribute to a misery that they seem unable to control or escape. <br /> <br /> The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how a person could have slipped to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no clues or explanations of caution, just an unredeemed horror show for humor or insight. <br /> <br /> This crushing plain of the film makes the achievement of the theatrical version (in the hope that it is ultimately filmed for the cable) even more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail of the film being discussed, but in a strange way, by putting music in the situation of the sad inmates, it elevates human tragedy to art. Even more important, this act is preceded by an excellent Act I in which we meet with women before they become madly empowered, and are offered clues as to how their isolated purgatory took place. In short, everything that FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the filmmakers (or their successors), the excellent launch of the Criterion DVD includes footage and extra material that partially redeems the main film, behind the scenes, interviews and comments photographs: filling in some of the the blank spaces that the original edition decided to omit consciously in its drive for horror and unadulterated depression. They can not make the amateur movie satisfactory, but at least they can make it a little more understandable. <br /> <br /> However, ultimately, it's just the extraordinary theatrical piece inspired and extracted from it by the writer Doug Wright, the composer Scott Frankel and the lyricist Michael Korie that raises the rating of the original GRAY GARDENS above a single (generous) star.
