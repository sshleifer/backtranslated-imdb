WOW is all I can say if you read it or are thinking about it or thinking about it. Trust me, look at it! <br /> <br /> I laughed so much about so many parts of this movie that the worst performance that has been done is very funny. I can not believe they have superimposed the school poster! I must have played that scene again and again just to laugh more and more. If you can make a movie like this, it gives us all the hope of making our own movies. even the disguise was bad. It seemed that my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job to achieve it. Hell, I bet he could have written and done better too. All I know is that I have to see the second part to see if it was as bad as the first. It's a good idea about a killer scarecrow, but you could have done a much better job. Let's hope another scary scarecrow film comes out, but not like this one.
