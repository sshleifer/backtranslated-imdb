While most of the film is very amateur, the Kosher killing scene is represented, but it is not false. The kosher law says that an animal must be aware when the leaf touches its skin. The scene of the Kosher killing is accurate, since anyone knows who has seen it, or has seen Peta's movie showing a Kosher killing, in which the throat of the animals is cut, and the esophagus is cut while it is still I live, consciously and, obviously, suffer. We must remember that history is written by the victors. Can you even think that maybe the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Does not it say something that the Nazis had banned this vicious religious slaughter, and Jews still practice it today?
