This movie is really brilliant. Through banality it is exhausted to shit at such a speed that you do not even see the good sense and common decency of humanity passing by. But it does not stop there! This movie hits the bottom of the canyon so hard that it bounces to the point of an absurd comedy: behold Kor, the beergutted Conan Wannabe, with the overabundance of hair on his neck, points his things by swinging his sword as if there were no One morning (and the way I swinged him, I'm really surprised that there * is * a tomorrow for him, or at least, for his bowels of beer). Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic game through idiocy and pure bloody mentality! And once you've finished seeing this, dry the tears of joy (or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt to tell stories) from your eyes because some stupid F00L gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
