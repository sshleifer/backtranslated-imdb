I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it a 3, but it's hard to remember what it could have been. Possibly Xtro (unpleasant and boring) or possibly Creep (just boring), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It is difficult to know where to start. Let's say it's Under Siege by a poor man, starring an even poorer man, Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming characteristic was to see Casper Van Dien, I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, it was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging by this site, you've been stuck in the hell of the television movie ... Casper, be more selective ... please! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned myself in and there's a decent half movie about Criminal Law ... now I'm starting to really be resentful for the last 1.5 hours!
