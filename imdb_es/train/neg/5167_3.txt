I rate this movie with 3 skulls, just because the girls knew how to shout, this could have been a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were fine, I thought they were evil, but the older brother and the younger one, Sucked very badly, it seemed that they were reading the scripts instead of interpreting them ... spoiler: if they are vampires, why do they freeze the blood? Vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the movie says: let's drink it while it's alive ... but when they move to another house, they cool down and freeze. at the end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> it was a huge waste of time, and that made me angry because I read all the reviews of how this movie was great, how many awards this film won and this movie was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
