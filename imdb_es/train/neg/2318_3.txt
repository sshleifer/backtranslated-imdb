A child found in the garbage of a baby and raised in a martial arts academy has a special ability to sink baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters the university and is promoted to the championship while looking for his real parents. Infinitely better in action comedy pieces is a real disaster as a whole. He seems to be fighting for a hippy basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is a scatter shot, his approach wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD in quadruple espresso. I kept asking "What am I seeing?" I saw it from beginning to end and I still do not know what the hell happened. It's a shame, as there are some great action scenes, some funny jokes and an occasional moment, but nothing, none of them meets, I would take a pass.
