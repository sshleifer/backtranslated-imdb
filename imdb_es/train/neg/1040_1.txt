I can not believe that this movie has achieved a relatively high rating of 6! You can barely see it and it's incredibly boring, definitely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> In a way without a budget, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the pure impression that you are seeing a total and creative train collision. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It is one of those "festival films" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made that people think that it makes them "different", therefore good. <br /> <br /> The bad film making is not "different", it's just a bad movie.
