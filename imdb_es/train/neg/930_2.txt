Some children are walking in the mountains, and one of them goes to a large tunnel and discovers a mummified old gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so absurd that it is maddening. Here is a short list of things that do not make any sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A boy and a girl are in their store and think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream, so they go back to the store, do they arrive the next morning? It was only 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two fools listen to another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but do not investigate because they fear that they will get lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another boy and girl are walking, and in about their tenth scene together, the girl informs the boy that due to the circumstances, the protocol no longer requires him to address her as a teacher . I want to say that ...? First of all, it's just a really stupid thing; secondly, he never called his teacher in the first nine scenes they were in together. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of her gladiator training taught her to hurt without killing. Um, yes, we realized that she is hurt and not dead because she is up and walking. But, thanks for that little information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is tied up in the Demonicus lair, and when someone tries to free her, she tells this person to go and get help. Mmm, look, idiot, if she released you, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help. <br /> <br /> And go on and on. The whole middle part of the film is spent with the two idiots who get lost in the forest, then they fight, then they build a tent and they ignore the cries of their friends, then they wander a little more. It's so boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off in half. <br /> <br /> None of these characters is sympathetic, especially those who get the most screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him: he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, wrinkling his face to look evil. He runs, or should I say, as if he were gay. The special effects are comical, the acting is for the most part horrible, and nothing makes any sense. <br /> <br /> In general, perhaps this concept could have produced a very funny movie if more time and effort were spent. Get rid of the ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with nice real personalities, having some kind of logical flow into the action, and maybe even turning Demonicus into a female character with a sexy gladiator costume. But no, instead, we get this pile of meaningless nonsense that will lead you to death.
