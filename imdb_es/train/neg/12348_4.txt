This movie is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that dance movie with Jennifer Beals. That movie is probably the most boring movie I've seen, since it's not even bad enough to be fun. "G. I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but that does not say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is loud music and we can watch her fight and everything, but she certainly is not very attractive. I really think that the idea behind the film is quite interesting, but the script is too clich√© and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, like I said ... it's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
