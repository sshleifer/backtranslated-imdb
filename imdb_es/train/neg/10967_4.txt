Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And, I like low budget movies, B <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I even like bad acting, heavy scripts, wooden lines, improbable situations, etc. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons listed above, and many more. That includes the blatant and blatant use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to the male genitals, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely of ineptitude. Unlike some attempt to do something really different. I refer to any film that takes years to record it, I simply can not maintain the level of congruence and focus that the modern public demands. <br /> <br /> I expected the whole movie to be just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. . However, unfortunately, it was destined to happen, as we saw things develop on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can express, is that the image at the end was great. If it had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where it ended 2001 ... <br /> <br /> To the bad, they did not try it. I just do not understand what was so important about this movie that it even had to be done. Was it the plot? Surely, it could not be. Were the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was the dialogue? Emphatically, no. Music? Perhaps, but more likely the unvarnished ego of the directors who need to be caressed. <br /> <br /> Much better efforts have died on the floor of the cutting room.
