Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I have not seen it since then. Although I just saw the trailer. Do you think it's a first grade movie? I do not think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely see it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting the girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I got scared by this movie. Now, today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe young children should not see this movie, even if it's PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this to children. I do not even remember what it was about, once was enough!
