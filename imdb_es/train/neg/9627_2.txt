Okay, I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller, although I'm unhappy with Jennifer Aniston. I do not think that this girl can act in the least. Each film or situation comedy in which I have seen it is very difficult to overcome its false performance. It seems that she is standing there reading the script. This movie just had something good about that, and that is that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused that it is ridiculous. How many movies does this same type of plot have? Can we say "forces of nature?" Not only the plot is so old, but the result is so predictable, it's boring. He knew everything that was going to happen before it happened. It was a bore, but seeing Stiller is always a delight!
