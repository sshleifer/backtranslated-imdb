Awesome! <br /> <br /> In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, he felt comfortable and seemed a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like a mannequin with affected gestures and mimicry. They made a caricature! The real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after films like "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and facts" by Golovanov. I was surprised by the boring stage, the bad performance and the production, and many inaccuracies of the "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The film is the tedious representation of well-known historical facts in Russia. It did not show a lot of interesting facts known about space projects. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was no longer a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was no longer in the gold mine of the Kolyma prison, but in a special design office of the prison. Korolev was the designer in the prison design office and the dead prisoners were not buried. But in the film, Korolev worked as a grave digger after 1940 (because the jailer has shoulder straps on his uniform). In my humble opinion, the film's authors do not have a deep knowledge of this part of the story and can not make interesting films.
