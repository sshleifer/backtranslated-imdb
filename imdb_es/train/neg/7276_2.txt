You can call this a failure, and that too is very big! The quality is not associated with the words National Lampoon, but at least the entries for Vacation and Animal House were fun, but this offer has to be the most insane feature I've seen to date. Ugh! The story of three pieces tries to parody the clichés and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood films, which turn out to be completely unhappy and dregs. <br /> <br /> "Grow up yourself". - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so that both can grow and do what they always wanted to do. That is life, as Jason sees it and he takes care of the children, but his decision to follow this path may not be correct. <br /> <br /> Talk about lead, boredom and rigidity. There is only a real interest in the small performance of the lovely Diane Lane. The satirical element here seems to be pointing to something that actually only delivers it. Silly humor is tense, flat and particularly pointless. Peter Riegert keeps him very much in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel continues with her role. <br /> <br /> "Seekers of success": after finishing the collage, Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is raped with some butter. For the Presidents of the Dairy Company. To recover, she is interested in the margarine industry and practically works her way up to the "very" higher. <br /> <br /> It's probably the best of the three, but the competition was not too good. they want to go more subtle with their sexual tone and oriented towards power, but still they feel more sticky and forced. The idea had something promising and inventive on which to build, but the languid rhythm begins to run out at the end and the disastrous dialogue does not. Do it with any favor. Humor tries, but most of the time it does not go away, despite hunger. The seductive Ann Dusenberry is quite cold and manipulative in everything (long after the painful experience) and likes to undress her with grace. Even the skimpy stripper set seems to be fully trained for the first half of the story. They appear funny cameos minors of Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and his favorite turn of Joe Spinell. <br /> <br /> "Municipalities" - A series The killer who leaves copies of his driver's license after each murder is being located by an enthusiastic rookie cop and his old gray-haired partner. However, the young policeman learns that being tough is the only way to leave, when the couple finds one situation after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yeah. Of course, if you are going to falsify something extremely exaggerated, make sure that laughter flows. Obviously they forgot that! Even in his 30 minute race, boy does it drag! The mocking performance of Robby Benson became quite dominant with a tired Richard Widmark doing very little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd minimizes the role of the serial killer, but his ironic and sympathetic performance works well and shows almost all the other clues. They appear Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems. When the jokes arrive, they really feel out of sync and become obsolete with their repetition of making fun of these police clichés. <br /> <br /> In general, the idiotic material tied with their skits appears as disposable, and the unbearable script is basically inept and witty. Only one or two few gags manage to get out of each segment, but in reality there are too many stinky or simple mistakes that stick in your head. This is because it virtually becomes what you are trying to make fun of and this is basically shown in each story. It is lost sight of. The performances vary from hot to cold, but those who can not deny the shame felt on most of their faces. The first test of the director Bob Giraldi is insipid for "Grow yourself", but "Success Wanters" showed some minor blooms of slight effectiveness. Henry Jaglom does a laborious job in "Municipalians". The vividly crude drawings by Rick Meyerowitz that open the film are carefully designed and continue to establish the style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-browed comedy frustrates you by overestimating it, with the main interest derived from the family cameos. But really, is it worth it to go through this rotten and restless attire, just to spot them? Well, that depends on you.
