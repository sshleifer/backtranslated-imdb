I have no idea what director of audience, George Schlatter, expected to sell this comedy of evils. With Redd Foxx in the central role and with enough high-quality polyester clothing to upholster the entire 1970s, "Norman" plays as an image of blaxploitation combined with any number of episodes of comedic comedies with comedic misunderstandings, because mention an elongated camelon from Waylon Flowers! Based on a work by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of a separated married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) who learned the hard way that his son is secretly gay, and who lives with a disheveled and budding white homosexual, He has enough lameness. Jokes to embarrass any early episode of "Three's Company." Bailey maintains her dignity, and Foxx's confusion is good for a couple of giggles, but the rest of the artists are humiliated. * since ****
