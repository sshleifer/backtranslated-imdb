This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of scrap shows that they lack original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that the audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot who rented the movie) is also discouraging. <br /> <br /> The obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills the family of a teenager because he loves her. For no reason kill the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad performance and the direction. Years later, the obsessed teacher leaves prison. HMM - the usual bad writing - nobody in the city that terrorized knows until the last minute. The master obsessed in some way becomes a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff people and with a knife is super killer. Of course!!! Now, the obsessed teacher kills the hotel maid for no reason, stabs Bellhop for fun and begins to hunt the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to make the girl love you. The obsessed master sneaks out of the hotel; Again, it's stupid, as long as a cop knew his face, but he walks with them. Now he kills two cops outside a teenager's house and somehow sneaks into his room and kills his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive thing about this piece of garbage. If any other profession took a job of this low quality, they would be fired. However, these idiots are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this garbage.
