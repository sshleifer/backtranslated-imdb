* spoliers * read no more if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Picking up after the depressing "Phantasm II" ended; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and the new boy Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get it back, and do not end up as slaves in Tall Man's "Red Planet". This one becomes really silly: Threesome of thieves in the bright pink hearse was just there for comic relief, and the black karate girl (I do not remember her name) was so irritating that she could not wait to see if the tall man killed her character. This sets it up to make it look like it was going to be Tim's character, who is late and, ultimately, is the hero, but ... it does not work that way. At the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by murderous dwarves, Mike has a silver sphere implanted in his skull, the spheres get Reggie and the dwarves catch Tim, and there is no one left to stop The Tall Man. The bad guy wins : Now, how is that for a surprise turn at the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and was not released until '95, and the end of this was at the final moment, and although it is disappointing and anticlimactic it was also an appropriate and appropriate ending for this little girl strange series. But the fourth changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes, and an even worse and more absurd ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
