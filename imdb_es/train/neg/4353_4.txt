The Class is a comedy series that portrays a group of former classmates of 27 years. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why I am sad that The Class is not funny, even though it has the obvious potential. Cork is not enough, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and the lack of really fun lines. Also some actors have difficulties over time. <br /> <br /> The most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem a bit too square for the good of the show. On the other hand, the characters that interest me most are the main character, Ethan, and Duncan and Nicole, who get used to being a couple. <br /> <br /> What bothers me about the series is that the only Latin character that is Aaron is to be chosen for his accent (even if it's for a non-respectable character, but anyway).
