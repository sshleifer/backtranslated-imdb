I'm sure there's some kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K scoffed at. After seeing this and "Werewolf" and reading dozens of comments about how underestimated they are, I convinced myself that there is some intrusion here. Many people are saying that people who hate him "are just scared by the gore", "I do not know the good horror" or things like that. Well, I really do not care about the gore, but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around! Or walking around the house / garden! A film requires something to give it an environment, you do not understand it just by having useless scenes where someone walks and stares. Oh, and "it makes you think"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> P.s. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of thing.
