A tense comedy, a magazine similar to a sketch that was initially a vehicle to show the radio star Jack Pearl, but now is best remembered as the introduction of the United States to The Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curly and Moe are credited with the comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the supporting cast features Jimmy Durante (who is completely lost in subdued material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the film these days are addicted to the Stooges, and even they will not find much to applaud here. Incredibly noisy and dominant, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
