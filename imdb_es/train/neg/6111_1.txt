Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress. On the other hand, starting in the 1980s, real talent for acting seemed to be less and less a required skill in Hollywood, so Bo could have gone to bigger and better things after the big box office take of " 10 "That is, if she had not allowed her husband, John Derek, to take charge of her career. Numerous videos of Playboy and bad films like this one (this one in particular) directed by John destroyed the impulse that he had and made him the target of many jokes. In the 1980s it was assumed that a certain personality could be put in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. John thought that putting Bo in a movie where she was naked for much of the execution time would make people go to the theaters after the 10 exaggerations. Maybe if the movie had been good maybe. This version of Tarzan must be the worst of all the interpretations of the Lord of the Burroughs jungle, a slap in the character's book and the cinematic legacy. In fact, Tarzan is a secondary thought, since the film is primarily a vehicle for Bo's breasts and the wonderful performance of Richard Harris (remember, the couple had worked together in Orca). His chewing of landscapes helps you stay awake during the boredom of everything and yes, the movie is pretty boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been filmed by someone in a trance. Bo's body can only take you so far. Miles O'Keeffe, who played Tarzan, would at least go to a long and pleasant film career B and Richard Harris may leave this behind after his recent triumphs in acting, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two. It served to show why her career as a director and her acting career died in the first place. <br /> <br /> And how did the orangutan get to Africa?
