Have you ever heard the saying that people "telegraph their intentions?" Well, in this movie, the actions of the characters do more than telegraph future plans: they appear drunk in your house and harass you in the head. This could be forgiven if the configuration had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, it is only wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the brazen charm that his character was probably written to have. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: obvious argument, interpretations of a note, unpleasant characters, and grotesque "southern" accents used by British actors.
