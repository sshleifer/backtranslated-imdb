DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of 4) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is such a deceptive and desperate comedy that makes you feel like at home The sofa that watches a comedy act by Chris Rock on television looks like heaven. Speaking of heaven, the movie is based on the 1978 movie "Heaven Can Wait." That was a good movie, and this is good to show how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz lose almost all the objectives. From concept to story, "Down to Earth" fails miserably; This is an incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a lousy comedian, both in his role in this film and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager, (Frankie Faison) even feels sorry for him when he is booed offstage during an amateur night at a local theater. Shortly after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by a moving truck. The death, played by Eugene Levy, has made a mistake in taking Lance before his number increased. The assistant of God (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance recover the rest of his time on Earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> The name of the old man is Mr. Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann), who is stealing his money. But it's fine because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, has fallen in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are plans to kill Wellington, Lance tries to get a better body and the confused feelings of Sontee. with a hospital situation that involves Mr. Wellington's finances. <br /> <br /> "On Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a meaningless and unconvincing love story full of recycled objects and material. The biggest problem with which he finds himself is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he will not be absent from most of this movie; all the characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is convenient for the love story; We believe that a young woman would fall in love with Lance, but in reality, he is actually an old and gray-haired man. That is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The funny situation of a joke is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that a young black man really does. But what inspires laughter is when the characters come into conflict without their knowledge. Just look "There's something about Mary." In the funny scenes, the characters are exposed to uncomfortable experiences, and not at will. Here, Lance knows that he is in the body of an old man, and he does things that the elders would not normally do. If Lance did not know the body he was in, that could have had a potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never met Mr. Wellington in the first place, so how can we compare Lance in his Body when we do not know what it was like originally. To make matters worse, Chris Rock needs to be the center of attention here, and makes the character is very similar to Rock. Recites simple routine jokes that are tedious and painful; Your dialogue is so obvious, wooden and direct. I hated the movie's sense of humor. There are so many funny jokes and horrible comical situations. It's like watching Chris Rock be Chris Rock, not a character in a movie. <br /> <br /> Let us emphasize the positive aspects of "Down to Earth". Mark Addy does not do anything worse here than in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well chosen, but they are at the mercy of a script with horns. Those are all the good qualities that I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to remember, it is not likely to occur to me anymore.
