The more I think about it, there was nothing redeeming about this movie <br /> <br />. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could have made it worse <br /> <br /> than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 of <br /> <br /> 10. < br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I met the director. he seemed so confused <br /> <br /> as to what he was doing or what he had done, and from what he could say, he did not care about the movie either. even he agreed that <br /> <br /> he really did not know what he was doing, and he was forced to do <br /> <br /> certain things because it was filmed digitally. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was trying to adapt to the formula that <br /> <br /> it built for itself: "9 people have to be connected in some way. <br /> < We can get from point 'A' to point 'B' ", so to get from the prostitute <br /> <br /> we see at the beginning and back to it at the end, 10 <br /> <br /> minutes in the relationship of each character with another person. <br /> <br /> makes one feel suffocated by the 2 demensional characters, badly drawn <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I just remembered the redemptive part of the movie ... Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi there is a scene where it is amazing. That's. Like me <br /> <br /> I say ... 4 out of 10.
