It was agonizingly bad movie. It will eat your heart while you watch it. I beg you not to see this movie! You will hate yourself losing 1.5 hours of your life! It's not like some movies that are so bad you can watch them and enjoy them ... this movie is boring like ... there's nothing more boring than this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie until the end. And you will hate yourself for not having listened to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and saw this movie until the end. Now excuse me, I'll shoot. I have seen everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
