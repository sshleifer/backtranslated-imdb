I saw the movie last night here at home, but first I thought it was too long. Second, the things I saw in the movie were too out of text to have in this what I thought was going to be a comedy-like movie like the rest before. Things are not fun in the movie: the boyfriend beats his girlfriend, the beatings. The movie was too long. Talk about wanting to go to sleep and ask yourself when it will end when you get up and you're still playing! Some of the things in the meeting were too much to capture, like the lady singing, I felt like I was almost watching a spiritual song show here! Come on Perry, you can do better than this!
