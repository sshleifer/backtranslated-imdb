So that you, the fans of the movies, understand the theme of this movie, I decided to write another review. I missed some things the last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, the performance. Third, Jesus Christ, what were they thinking of doing a piece of trash like this and then hoping that we would enjoy it when there are no redeeming characteristics from beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes finally gets impressed in a very unenlightening climax? br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money on this when I could have handed it over to a homeless person or a busker or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Are you getting an idea?
