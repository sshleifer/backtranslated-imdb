The writers and producers of this little excursion have plummeted new depths of depravity. Was the writer's block blocked so much, Or were ideas so dry, that they were forced to include a disgusting scene in which a young woman defecates in the backseat of a van, and then throws the excrement into the car behind it? ? at least this sums up what this movie is worth). We had already treated one of the other women who urinated on one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; Once it would have sufficed ... we received the message! This really is taking bath humor to another level! If the script and the acting had been better, I could easily have forgotten that I was watching a movie shot completely in a low-budget video. This was a quite original story, with an intelligent (the only) direction in which we could only take the point of view from inside the truck; So making it feel much more real. We could never see inside other places, like the tent or the field where several of the women disappeared, and this could have added much-needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script was serious. Lines like: "I do not feel very well ... I want to go home" after a psychopath has persecuted one of the girls; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and fired, it seems a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> The performance was diabolical (apart from the maniac). The 5 leading actresses learned to act by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with the subtitles. <br /> <br /> The director seemed to have an easy job in this. It seems that the only direction he should have given was: 'Scream girls'. <br /> <br /> AND AS FOR SCREAMS ... If you look at this, make sure you have some paracetamol ready!
