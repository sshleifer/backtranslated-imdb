First, we can all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered an expert actor, hardly even decent, sometimes just lousy. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ Named SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam veteran named Jack Kelly, also known as a Soldier (who is supposed to be as strong as a leather belt and something else, which you can believe when he puts a nail palate through the feet of 2 men and holds them to the floor), he learns that his family has been murdered and his sister kidnapped. Therefore, he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. He had some potential, but he was still too thin to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now, the acting. Being an actor, I am qualified to say that this was one of the worst performances in the history of art. Lamas is, well, himself. The assaults that play the rejections of Clampets / Deliverance must be tied and filmed for their supposed performances that are insulting to actors around the world, especially the talented ones who never get their big break! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. The shooting is regular at BEST, and the fist fight is deplorable. I've seen more real-looking fights in the Renaissance Festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE OF COCOA AT ALL COSTS! IF IT WAS THE ONLY MOVIE IN EXISTENCE, STILL WANT TO AVOID IT! For the sake of your brain cell count, DO NOT look at this!
