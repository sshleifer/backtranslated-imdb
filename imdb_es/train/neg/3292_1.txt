For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I'll start with the bad points. <br /> <br /> Bad points: the launch options (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), the acting of said evil cast Elenco, the story, the idea of ​​putting the film in the present, the direction, the editing , the soundtrack and, above all, the idea of ​​making a movie from a television series that was not so good to start with. with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> One could make an analogy here. In the scene in which Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke makes her way to Michael Weston as Enos, and asks: "Enos, where are Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", In his murky trial, he tells him where they are. I could have asked, "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would have muddied his judgment to say yes, although in his right mind had said: "No, not really." while I was looking in the bikini, she could have been completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible movie. Stay out of Hazzard!
