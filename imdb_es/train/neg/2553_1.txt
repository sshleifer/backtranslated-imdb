Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What more can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct. Maybe I should act again ... on second thought, I was a bad actress. Who would put money to produce something so bad? I like anti-Christ movies and I usually have a lot of fun and it scares me a little, but this is just bad bad bad. The performance of the stars was worse than that of a telenovela. Special effects, if you can call them that, are laughable. I would not be surprised if you reproduced the scenes in slow motion, you saw the tubes to which the blood shoots. We had to turn off the disk after only 30 minutes. The so-called original films must be destroyed, all discs and tapes destroyed and all people involved in the making of the film have to return money to the people who rented it. Then those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film anything other than their own home movies.
