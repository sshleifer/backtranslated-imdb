I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought about giving his sister Rain Phoenix a chance. I regret having checked it. She was shameful and the movie only has this weird plot if that's what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet and they both sleep with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just total garbage. I can not believe that the actors agreed to make a waste of film, money, time and space. That Sissy is "beautiful" did not affect me. I thought she was anything but that. Those thumbs were stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT IS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame, the poll does not have a 0, it does not even deserve 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other movies, I forgive him for this one performance, I mean I would not do much better with that movie.
