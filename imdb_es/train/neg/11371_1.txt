The "documentary", and we use that term in an apparently flexible way, summarizes that Muslims are trying to take over the world violently. Then he affirms that any Muslim who does not admit this is ignorant of his own faith or lies to your face! In addition, each person interviewed in the film has found a market for his ridiculous take on reality by selling traps to conservatives willing to let others think for them. What the West NEEDS to know is that this is nothing more than propaganda directed at mental dwarfs. If you are looking for a real documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources.
