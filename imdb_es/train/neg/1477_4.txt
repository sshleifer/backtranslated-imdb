I have seen Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other excellent works of the blaxploitation canon of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, The Human Tornado (also known as Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. Out of sheer stupidity, lack of skill in movie production and absolute enthusiasm (frankly, too much), The Human Tornado can not be beat. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is sleeping with a white woman, when some racist local police raid the house for no good reason, and you would not know it! The woman in the bed with old Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. She screams when she sees him: "He made me do it!" The cry of Dolemite: "& $ * @ $ are you real?" Subtlety was never his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of the fame of the Ghostbusters), the continuity errors (the characters look in one way in a shot and the other in the next, the Dolemite suit changes color in each shot of his nightclub act) and the demon Queen Bee. Eyes in his first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is the same Rudy Ray Moore. Did the man really think he looked good in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the enthusiasm it has. Whether jumping totally naked from a cliff, or barking orders to your gang in rhyme (for example: Quick! To the cave! I have a plan to let that mother $ * @ (% and dig her own grave!) The man commits totally, certainly, he goes overboard, never more than ever when he does kung fu, the climactic battle is filmed at great speed, but occasionally he slows down to let Rudy pose and grit his teeth. they also wanted it, as if they accelerated the movie as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe that he was so fast, in any case, "The Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, very similar to Original Dolemite, it's an incompetent movie of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun, and you certainly have to give these people credit for the effort, just not so much, enjoy my recommendations.
