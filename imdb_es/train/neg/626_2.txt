The spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow who then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. It has a great looking monster, it has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere, but it manages to short circuit the good with the bad. Halfway there I started to move quickly and then I went through the chapters of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie are many. First of all, the cast seems to be about thirty years old and, nevertheless, they are supposed to be in high school. You do not believe anything from the beginning as a result. The scarecrow, although it looks very good, is not much more than that. A liner says stupid and moves in a more designed way to be funny and scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? It is a problem that goes beyond the lines of a large part of the dialogue and configuration. It seems more of every clich√© than the sincere horror movie. Somehow I hope that the film was made for a very limited audience, horror fans who want to make fun of the genre instead of embracing it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good looking monster, this is a movie to avoid. Even if you pick it up in the trash for less than five dollars, you are paying too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
