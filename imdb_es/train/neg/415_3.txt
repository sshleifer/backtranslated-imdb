Let Paul "have sex in the brain", Verhoeven, develop a youthful and meaningless version of the story of INVISIBLE MAN. If I directed a Pok√©mon movie, I'm sure it would turn it into a kind of massive orgy. I do not care about sex or even sleaze (see my other reviews) in the movie, but frankly, it's obvious that the director has a one-track mind and could not see interesting aspects about the story of an invisible man that implications perverse It's a shame because it could have been good if the movie did not spend so much time having Kevin Bacon groping with the women. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors in the game does what they can with the cheesy script of a note, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally lost here. <br /> <br /> But then, what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, by the way, is much more entertaining than this malicious and bad movie?
