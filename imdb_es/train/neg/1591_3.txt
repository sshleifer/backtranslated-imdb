After seeing many of the reality TV screens of "Next Action Star", TiVo recorded for me this icy and horrible gut. For some strange reason, and I just have to blame myself, I saw everything with the hope that there was * something * unique in the whole movie. After so much exaggeration about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action movies, he might want to make sure he recovers from his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, the only redeeming value of the whole movie was Billy Zane, and even he could not get the slippery script from the crapper. Having said that, Zane's performance wobbles about 2/3 of the way, since he does not seem to know what else to do, apart from looking smug. <br /> <br /> I can not blame him here, though. The writing, frankly, reeked. Take ideas from "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and any bad game movie you can think of and just review it. And who had the brilliant idea of ​​having TWO chase sequences on a bridge in a ROW? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, the "man of the hour" from "The Next Action Star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the casting Directors mention throughout the series of the series. Sean of a single note, Sean plays the handsome fool very well, but struggles with the weight of the film. Frankly, it seems we never care if he lives or dies halfway, since Carrigan does not provide a reason for the audience to like it. Your dumb but lucky routine gets old, since there really is nothing about the character you support. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the rigid Corinne Van Ryck of Groot wood. Howard Fine really told you to pretend to be Terminator for the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I kept waiting for her to date Arnie. His character "performance" can be compared only to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered", although not so well developed. The camera loves her in dark and dark limousines, but in the harsh light of day her behavior sucks all the energy from the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed a more natural life in her part of five minutes than Corinne showed in any part of her screen time. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean has the robust look to provide a good lead in a joint cast, but he should not have let himself do this alone. It was simply too big a task for him. The colleague of "Next Action Star", Jared Elliot, may or may not have had better luck with a more dynamic characterization, but it is difficult to say, given the unconvincing script of Jeff Welch. Someone should take Welch's iMac away before he hurts himself or someone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outgrown and out of reach, even for a complete shlock like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
