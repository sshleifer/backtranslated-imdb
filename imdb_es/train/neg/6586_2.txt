If you appreciate rebirth in Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The film hardly deserves to be mentioned along with A-list works like Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even material as good as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and a decidedly non-Western take on what is terrifying. Gawi is bound with the limbs and leftover organs of everything that has made the American horror terrible for the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film is about mixing the Asian ghost story and the Hollywood movie, but it's a bad fit. One aesthetic is meant to stifle the other; Guess which By not having a story of their own to tell the filmmakers, they plunder Ringu in search of a secondary plot of evil children, but the situation is desperate. Clich√©s, shit characters, ingenious conspiracies, a boring ghost, ho hum.
