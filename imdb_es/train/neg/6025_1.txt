Left Behind is the kind of "we know what we know because we know it" film that Christians (and almost any other naive person) need to help them feel like what they "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (not "KNOW") is Right . But, at the same time, I feel bad for the little ones, because this is not a well-made movie. It does not help any message. I work in a video store, and I KNOW that the ONLY reason why people went to see this movie was because they were religious and thought it was. ANYONE on this earth that thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know they do not know. I've had enough (but only after having had too much) of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movie starring a semi-talented television actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love you, you will stay away. I refuse to go into details about this movie (not because the AI ​​did not see it (because I saw it), B: it was too shocking for my atheist to handle it (because it was not), or IC really did not have anything to say wrong about it (because I do) The reason (which is a word that nobody helped to make this film) is that I want this movie to go out of my head, I want it to be made from my head, I want you to have seen it ALL WITH AN OPEN MIND, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and politely conveys at the end of the film, I just want all the things that were in my head BEFORE watching these movies there, everything directly related to this movie that is floating in my head COME OUT My peaceful anger is running out, I am sorry that someone in this world has gone to the cinema to see this movie about what might happen in the future (but will not) when they could have given Seven Dollars Plus to any number of human, animal or charity of the tropical jungle. But if they did it so that later they could not "BELIEVE" in the fact that it is real, they might have to do what it is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (from ****)
