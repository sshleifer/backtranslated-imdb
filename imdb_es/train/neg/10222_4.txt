In addition to the great cinematography of the wonderful James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real stench. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so bad that I turned it off. I'm afraid this is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps, her performance as the virgin Queen was good by 1937 standards, but when you compare her with Helen Mirren's, it is unparalleled. Robotically, Robson exposes his lines. His message of battle to the English troops is so tarnished in spirit. <br /> <br /> Even a handsome Laurence Olivier can not save this total boredom. <br /> <br /> The future wife, Vivien Leigh, is in a supporting role here and she really does not convey anything here. To think that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the history of the Spanish Armada is so boring in this movie.
