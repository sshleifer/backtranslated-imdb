I think Phillip Kaufman read the Notes version of Kundera's novel on the cliff and then started making this movie. Well, of course he will not have the blow of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to enter and leave the stories he builds. This movie does not even try! Tereza's unique sequence of dreams, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reformulated and makes no sense. Also, and this is perhaps a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the loafing of otherwise fine literature.
