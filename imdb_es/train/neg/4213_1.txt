Wow, I'm a big fan of the Henry VIII / Tudor era and, well, this was ... interesting. The only one I saw was Catalina de Arag√≥n. And wow ... just wow. I have seen wrong to act before, but this has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm ... crying? she moans and screams and I have to admit that I rewound many times ... many, many times ... fun and funny things. The only person who even showed a bit of talent was the actress who plays Anne Boleyn (although I might have prejudices, I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, I was a really female, read about her, it's worth it! A lot about Tudor's time period and I think the characters were not very accurate, they were all very stereotyped, just watch this movie if you are prepared to see a very important period of time, and the important lives of those involved became in a laugh
