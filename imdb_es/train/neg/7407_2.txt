First seen 06/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): Strange psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being examined in a hospital, the power flashes and then all hell breaks loose. Honestly, I'm not sure what the intentions of the filmmakers were in this case. What we got during the next 1 hour and a half (at least no more) was a twisted horror / twilight zone / zombiefest / ghost movie that really did not make any sense at all, even to the end. Initially, after the power is cut off, everyone is missing in the hospital, except for a small group of misfits, including the girl and her father. There is the typical annoying character, an eerie old man, and the typical tough guy, similar to many scarecrows and, of course, the young woman to whom the main character is attracted. Random things begin to happen at various times, such as the appearance of ghosts and monsters, a hint that time has stopped, and dead people when this small group tries to escape from whatever it is. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything in some way and I really hate the way they used this girl's affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and placing her in a hospital where people are taken care of is really boring. We never really found the answer to what was happening, which is very strange, so please, avoid this dog. Unless you want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, this is not for you or any viewer. What a waste of time really!
