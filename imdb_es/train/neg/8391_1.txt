Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title of his crapfest "House of 1,000 Corpses", now I can rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or the trivial script would resurrect in "The house of the seven corpses", but anyway a ghoulie genius emerges from his plan (ha!) To kill the damn fans making a low horror movie rent in his old home! In Hell House (sorry, I do not remember the real name of the residence), a long time ago there were a lot of mysterious and inexplicable deaths; some, such as Lurch's arthritic alternate John Carradine (whose small role provides the only valuable moments in the film), attribute it to the supernatural; The scream of film director John Ireland dismisses him as a superstitious hokum. The result appears as "The school for girls of Satan" (catchy title, production values ​​made for television, intriguing argument) crossed with "Children should not play with dead things" (low-income film about low-income filmmakers who awaken the dead); The problem is that it is not entertaining or fun at all. "The house of the seven corpses" is dead in the first frame, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes crossing the rigor mortis, dragging us for every second of pain ...
