My mother keeps a cassette of this movie as a general threat to anyone who loves the movie that bothers her. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave 10/10? Was he inadvertently watching a good movie and accidentally voted for it? <br /> <br /> All the people involved in the process of creating the film should be forced to see at least a small part of this movie. It should be an indelible stain on the minds of all that holds the sacred film and be revered as the mark of the tide of the cinematic.
