This is an interesting idea that has been spoiled. The meanings hidden in art left as clues by a serial killer sound intriguing, but the execution in "Anamorph" is extremely slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film except boring. The tracks of death are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is tedious. Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as a researcher, but has little to do with a script that stretches to the limit. Several actors of secondary characters are wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as the medical examiner and, above all, Deborah Harry, who appears on the back of the DVD case, but It only has a couple of lines spoken through a broken door. Not recommended. - MERK
