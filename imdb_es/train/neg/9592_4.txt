I've only seen the movie recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just stared at his point, then hit the opponents. Throughout the film, I waited to hear at least one confession about what he liked, why he was fighting, who he loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Bad taste movie. Dialogue in bad taste. Do not look at it unless you want to get bored! It's so bad, that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration for an hour and a half. Approximately. I give you a 4/10.
