I'm starting to see a pattern in the movies that I give a 1. They are almost all the movies that my wife made me see. Maybe he should stop having faith in his taste for movies. Anyway, this is typical nonsense directed at preadolescent girls but with an even worse performance than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of any film. He / she made the main character unpleasant. She starts being a complete b * tch for her friend at first, and then discovers when she turns 30, that she is basically an unpleasant person (having affairs, etc.). Why would F feel for this person? OK, let's say we can overcome that. Jennifer Garner is as far from being as attractive as she can be without having some kind of deformity. I do not know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes far beyond my threshold of annoyance. Here is a tip for future filmmakers: those of 13 years are NOT entertaining, they are annoying. In the distance, the most embarrassing moment of the film came when they danced to the "Thriller". Holy shit that was painful. He was shown practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but a full club full of people? Argh! The Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly, she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and nobody notices. At least the character of Tom Hanks in "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These nocturnal films that change bodies / that become adults are getting out of hand, and this is the worst of all.
