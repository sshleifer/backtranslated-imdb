This would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've almost seen. (I could not see it completely). Purely and simply it is gratuitous violence for the simple fact of doing it, and the ridiculous story only adds to the lack of brilliance and incompetence of the filming. Sick. And only suitable for those who love manic mutilation. After murdering several hundred men, women and children, Semilla is finally caught after effortlessly killing several police officers who finally receive a tip on his whereabouts. He is condemned to death by an electric chair and survives miraculously! Buried alive, digs out and plans to take revenge on those who pushed him away and hit the switch. Needless to say, more gruesome murders occur ...
