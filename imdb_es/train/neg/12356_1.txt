Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women become as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in combat, and that is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
