This stupid and implausible story is redeemed only by the initial scene in which a hardened police detective delivers some almost audible lines that confirm our greatest fears: he is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had given up the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That an unnamed street hacker can save a dirty water movie is no less likely than a villain who commits murder by throwing stones at a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. Your moment is short; His promise is immense. Maybe this dark actor gives us more time on screen if there is ever a sequel to this unwise movie.
