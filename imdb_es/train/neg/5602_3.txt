"Pandemonium" is a parody of a horror movie that is more stupid than fun. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially parody of comedy. "Plane", trilogy of "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that speak of a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not there with those movies. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in a stunned silence because the movie was not so funny. There are some laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh many more times and that is all that this film has in its favor. Geez, "Scream" had more laughs than this movie and that was more like a horror movie. How strange is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
