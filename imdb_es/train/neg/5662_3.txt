When I read most of the other comments, I felt they were too bright for this movie. I discovered that I had completely lost the spark of Zatoichi's previous films and only serves to show that, after a long absence from the screen, it is often better to let things be that way. I totally agreed with the Star Trek analogy of another critic who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie with the original series: millions of enthusiastic fans waited and waited for the return of the program and were forced to see a sterile and bland image. approximation of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly bloody (although Beat Takeshi's NEW NEW Zatoichi is much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the originals. I did not mind the blood at all, but some may be turned off by it (particularly the scenes with the nose cut off and the heads cut off). In addition, the time has not been good for Ichi, he seems a man sad and shattered in this movie (much, much more than usual), and that's something that fans of the series really do not want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sad return for Zatoichi. Unless you're like me and want to watch EVERY Zatoichi movie, this is very easy to skip. See one of the previous versions or the completely new 2003 version.
