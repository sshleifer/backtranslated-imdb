This superior inferiority to the original film of "Blind Dead" is another garbage waste. Many people have promoted these movies that I can not believe what they say about it. Since I was a kid, I've heard about how terrifying and great these films are, I saw them all and I was very disappointed. All in drugs, in the 1970s or just do not know how boring this crude is?
