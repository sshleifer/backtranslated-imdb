This film is about British prisoners of war of the Second World War who escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> Encounter "The wooden horse" disappointingly boring. The theme could have been exciting, full of suspense and adrenaline, but "The wooden horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and badly counted events, without suspension and emotion. The first half clearly says how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so simple, without enough errors and shaved so that I am on the edge. The second part of the movie is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without chasing cats and mice. And the characters could talk a little less and have more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed by "The Wooden Horse", it squandered the potential of being a great movie.
