I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. This is easily the worst sequel to be made. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. It was not only the performance of Mark Blankfield GOD-AWFUL, but also everyone! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by Mongoloid monkeys with the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze those vile cinematographic excrements surpasses me. They even made veteran actor Ray Walston look like a fool without a talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want to recover the 96 minutes of my life that I spent watching this memory of a brilliant comedy, so I can try to condemn all those involved for this cinematic atrocity.
