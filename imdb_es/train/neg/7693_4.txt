Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable? I do not think so. Basically, the movie is one cliché after another and nothing really is a surprise. It makes the film extremely predictable and because of that, the film also lacks tension. So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough, but also as a drama it is a failure. This is because the movie its history is very unlikely. I mean, in no way could this happen in real life, in the same way that events happen in this movie. So the film has a real problem of suspense and credibility. <br /> <br /> But they really are the clichés that killed the movie. Sometimes it was taking its toll. Everything is so formulated in this movie. The predator is represented as a young man without a heart, almost psychopathic, like a frustrated child and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts as if she does not see any of this. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and everything seemed to happen for a reason. Like the sequence in which the "predator" fixes the broken car of the "victims". That has to be one of the oldest clichés in the book. I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. I tried to see as if the teacher and the student were really growing together through the eyes of the other people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that time. The movie is full of moments like these. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that it is a cheap porn movie, but it is actually a movie for television. Which means that everything is happening slowly and the film spends half the time in the development of the character and unnecessary subplots to make the film even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is a good performance. In this film. She makes some of the clichés and events seem even almost realistic at times. Her career in Hollywood is as good as that of after appearing in the movie "Showgirls" by Paul Verhoeven, so, unfortunately, she probably still appears in movies and television series like this one. It's a waste of his talent and he surely deserves something better. All the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the "untouchable" rich boy of the cliché and the way in which the husband of the main character is represented is even worse. He looks more like a frustrated sexual predator than the real predator of the movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in each sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. He comes home, he wants sex. It may be a realistic thing, but I do not know, it just did not feel good for a movie like this and the story in general. <br /> <br /> A film full of clichés and I can not think. For any reason why someone should watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore also lacks suspense and credibility. It is not a 'horrible' movie and, certainly, it is a film that can be seen sometimes, but all the weak and cliché elements of the film also make this not the most recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
