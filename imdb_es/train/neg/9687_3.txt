This is a disconcerting movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sex between men and women is degraded by a group of men and women that can only be described as a collection of rare and maladjusted infants. <br /> <br /> Greenaway recognizes his inspiration for the Fellini movie "8 1/2", but while Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He has nothing of the lightness of the teacher's touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions. with a clarity skill. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, since the film is divided into chapters with an introduction written to each one, as if the viewer had to be guided in the film, except that written notices only remain. Screen for a few seconds, not enough for the audience to read, with the result that they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as spectators, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest oozes with ordinary. Both women and men withdraw from the harsh light of reality to the somber tones of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway obviously wants to point out that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are depressing as they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are degraded in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film, in fact, there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son , Philip and Storey Emmental, played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The insane indifference towards the two men that Giaconda is taking to her son, in fact, she gets pregnant twice, the first fetus was aborted and the second time, she was sent to a destination chosen by the men of a flight book. Both men have sex with a woman who does not have legs, (half the woman in the title). The bestiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son sharing women among them. Women who enjoy being beaten sexually. The father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only insinuate. <br /> <br /> The insinuated degradation of women is such that it can not be surprising that the film was booed when it premiered for the first time at Cannes. What is more extraordinary is that the actresses of the film lined up to defend it, which shows once again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will deceive themselves to be exploited by men. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's directorial style is pretentious, it's a triumph of style over substance, a representation of cinema as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to reach the sublimity of surrealism, but only manages to show The banality of human relationships.
