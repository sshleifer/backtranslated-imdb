Horror movie? Seriously? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what's the point of this movie? The movie almost 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the first 70 minutes of the movie, it's just Lena walking with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident ... not much talk, not even many actions. .. I have to say that the last 20 minutes had a very small action ... and it was still stupid ... and in the end, oh my God, I do not know where to start, I also finished with this. stupid look in the face of lena hahaha ... do not get me wrong, I love Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress, but I do not know what got into her to make this movie ... do not waste your time watching. It's because this movie has no history, it has no acting ... and it does not make sense ... not to mention the slowness of this movie and it feels as if you've been watching it forever.
