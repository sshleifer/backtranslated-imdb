I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, without disrespect to Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. The late Christopher Reeve was also wrong for the same reason. Will, according to the book, was about 30. I would love to see a little more exploration of his military life, the journey of his friend Red, Elly to see it, since it was an important part of the development of the history of the characters. Miss Beasley also felt bad when the book mentioned that she was a large lady. I know that the movie did not have the budget of "Bridges Of Madison County", which I think was released almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this was a poorly made movie, low budget and with errors. As someone mentioned, I would like Miss Spenser to come out of retirement and write scripts for her books as they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she also considers casting. The movie disappointed me!
