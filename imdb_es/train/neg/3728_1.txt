As other comments show, this movie can scare you when you're a small child. (And that's probably all that's good for). <br /> <br /> However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: it sucks a lot, and therefore I do not mean the performance, it's Soundtrack, cut or s.th. how that. I'm just talking about the "plot" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more spoilers of the necessary ones (if after reading this, you still want to see this movie) but if you graduated from a school, this is just a great insult to your intelligence. Seeing this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was SO MUCH stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> -the formation of UNITE (an evil UN-association) <br /> <br /> -> we are supposed to believe that it is bad. Is it even evil at all? If so, why is it bad? <br /> <br /> -the evil mark in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> no need to impose this on people, so why the hell (no pun) They are doing it? <br /> <br /> - invite Christ to your heart simply as a lip service <br /> <br /> -> because there is nothing, who in this film is considered "a true Christian", I do it, also saying that stupid prayer. so ... just say that prayer before the rapture and you will be saved, no matter what? <br /> <br /> Therefore, 1/10 rating
