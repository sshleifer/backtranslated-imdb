Budget, decent actors ... who knew that these things were important. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage. The effects are shit. The acting is shit. The only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a bit of cheap T & A and that was wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only remotely remote quality of this movie is the very clumsy blasphemy. It was as if they had found the only 7 people on the planet who had never cursed before. Take off your hats! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, just come back and look at the old pictures of the prom. The only way a Bigfoot movie is good is to have a big budget and some actors that do not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
