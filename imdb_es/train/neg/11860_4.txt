If you have not figured out what's going to happen in this movie in the first five minutes, give it a couple more minutes. Lilia is a widow. They have left it on the shelf for a long time and it wants to explode. She has a teenage daughter who only emphasizes that she is not getting younger. While investigating her daughter, she discovers a world she never dared ... the cabaret, where she can dance the belly dance with tiny sequined costumes while the men throw money at her. The movie is very misogymous. The representation of men is grim. Which is quite strange, since Lilia bends down to move around them, not for money, but for the fun of it. When he manages to wake them up, he makes her feel like a woman again. She does not want to connect with them, but is addicted to attention. The other dancers, all mostly older women who look like men on the street and realize that their time in the spotlight is short lived. Not short enough as I say. She finds romance, however brief, with you guessed it ... There are no surprises here that we did not see coming. Although the ending is good, you realize that it could not have ended otherwise. Maybe this movie is simply not directed to my demographics. 30 Men
