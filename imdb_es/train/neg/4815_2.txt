Like most comments, I saw this movie with the name of The Witching, which is the title of reissue. Apparently, the necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most witchcraft scenes still include most of the necromancy scenes and they are still bad. In many ways, I think the witch's added nudity at least added some entertainment value. But do not be fooled, there are only 3 scenes with nudity and it's from the people around the variety. There is no diabolical fight involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is horrible and directly from Troma's closet. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is boredom with a straight face personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the girl possessed in The Innocents, you would believe!) The worst with her shrill and high-pitched voice. Welles seems just waiting for his paycheck. The other protagonist has a spooky face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie. And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks a lot like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is filmed ineptly with scenes that change for no reason and the edition is choppy. This is because witchcraft is a copy and paste job, and not a subtle one. Only the lighting is fine. The sound is also frightening and it is difficult to hear it with the surprising new soundtrack that never closes. The 'ghost' mother is also just as stupid, but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it causes some involuntary laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (at least the witch) is only for the unwary. He can not have many healthy fans, since it is quite untimely and I actually found it boring. <br /> <br /> The best thing was when the credits came out; enough to say it just better for this poor excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!
