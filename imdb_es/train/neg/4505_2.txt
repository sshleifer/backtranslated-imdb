Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, of that there is no doubt. And acting in general is excellent, at least in terms of how he portrays the characters as they are programmed. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and big details are simply wrong, so it bothers me too much to be. able to enjoy it fully. A small detail that typifies the type of lack of sensitivity of a guy is a scene (without this not ruining anything) where Mameha plays a bell that hangs on the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell that is sounding is a fuurina or bell of wind, which is only left hanging outside the houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have doorbells, they simply opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think that this is such a trivial detail, but I would compare it to a movie made about the United States where a Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and nobody thinks about that). And they do not even make me start. about the totally wrong hairstyles that are given to the maiko and the geisha, which are vaguely Pan-Asian / Chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like a real thing. I think that this somewhat arrogant attitude towards the culture that they try to portray really manifests itself in the attitudes and portraits of people and situations as well. <br /> <br /> So, I guess the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), I guess the more you enjoy it. Honestly, I think this movie could have been much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan."
