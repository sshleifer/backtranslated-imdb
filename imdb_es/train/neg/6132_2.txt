When we were kids, my friends and I thought that Gymkata was the most violent and bloody movie ever made. I'm not sure who started that rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10-year-olds who could not see it for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial television movie at night, and as a result, I was able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes of this terrible excuse for a movie more than a dozen times, and I can always see it from 1 to 2 seconds of screen time. However, apart from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the rigid dialogue and the outrageously difficult plot, the film has some things in its favor. With everything that's wrong with the movie, the sound is quite entertaining. Never before has a blow or a kick landed with so little force and so much volume! The canned sounds of kung fu are brazen, but the slow, high-pitched music and the slow-motion scene of almost 5 minutes are really strange. The persecution through the city of demented and bloodthirsty villagers is not really tense but irritating, and there are enough wigs and extras that almost everyone looks at the camera and salutes to make this train a little fun. Could you address the status of a classical cult? Where is MST3K when we need it?
