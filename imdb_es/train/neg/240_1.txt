I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to be very hard with it. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have lost it completely. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so corny that Badjatyas has left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment during the movie where I could say 'Oh! At least this is good. ' Aloknath makes a clich√© in the role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita Rao is another disaster besides the ugly looking sets, the bad costumes, the malicious plot, the monstrous stepmother, the actors trying to Do the hard act, the cacophono background music, cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now, the spoiler, I am warning you, as it happens in all your other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends with a happy note.
