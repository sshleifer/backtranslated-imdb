Greetings again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner." He also had some good movies ("Rainman"), but he always offered something of interest ... until now. I think the worst thing you can say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. Never from the big fan of the pure slap ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was surprised at how terrible this movie is. There are maybe 2 giggles in all this, if you can pay attention for so long. The best part of the movie is the gag of the title song by a similar Redbone sound. If the movie had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one of her weaknesses. Amy Poehler, SNL cast member, is her regular at the top in her role as the park's trash trailer turned princess. The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first joint work trip shows a promise, but after that, its chemistry disappears due to bad writing. This script is like most of the ideas of the character of Jack Black: it is not a bad thought, but there is no hope of success.
