Okay, when I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it was very scary and I was very excited to see it as was the group I was with. Now that I live in the United States, especially during this election, I see some very deceptive things, but I must say that these advances were towards the top of the list. I do not see how many people could be scared by this movie. I only noticed two real jump scenes and I just jumped in one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe that spoiled some of the jumping scenes for me. As for the sound effects that scared me so much, I thought they were comical at best. Oh and my cat, where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the strange moan. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now, do not get me wrong, I've always loved all those really terrible movies that make you laugh all the way, but I did not even think that this was right, it was just bad.
