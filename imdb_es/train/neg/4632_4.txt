MarÃ­a Bello does not seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. Once again, choose a very difficult movie and not popular to star. Maybe he needs those films, to remove the sugar covers (aka "Hollywood") he does here and then (Coyote Ugly and, of course, Mummy 3). /> <br /> While I think she does not achieve what she sets out to do (I will not spoil it), Maria Bello is as good as in her other independent / small films in which she stars. It is their performance that elevates this. movie. This combined with the strange subject almost helped me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, such as rhythm and dramaturgy), the film is still too long.
