Absolutely laughable movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly researched that it's ridiculous. Nobody could be terrified in the London Underground. In the short time that is not in service every night, there are teams of maintenance workers who monitor the tracks and perform repairs, etc. It is equally unlikely that there are homeless people living there. Or that it is even possible to stay locked up and not have access to a mobile phone today ... <br /> <br /> The worst is likely to happen if someone is there after the last train. so they can paint them graffiti. Although this has been under control due to the large number of security cameras in the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember that in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world). <br /> <br /> If you had settled in a city with which I am not familiar, maybe you could have enjoyed it because of ignorance. , but it's not a high quality movie, so I just could not suspend my disbelief and try to enjoy it for the little banal tale that it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given it 0/10 If such a rating existed! Possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever thought I'd like.
