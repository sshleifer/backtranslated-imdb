This piece of shit could have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it's one of the most racist movies ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a great racist in real life, as was his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short series that failed piously) only because Williams was black. As if that was not bad enough, this movie is very old-fashioned and boring. Watch "Dances with Wolves" instead of a less racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart was about forty years old when he made this horrible movie, and even with his ridiculous wig, he still looked like a pedophile chasing after 16 years. The old Debra Paget. I'm surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
