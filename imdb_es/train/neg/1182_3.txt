This movie is little more than a poorly made porn fetish, and this says a lot considering the similar trash that was made at that time. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique film experience". He was right. I guess he meant that as a joke. It's not disgusting, not even so shocking. Only the mediocre performance and the bad attempts of art of shock. A bit of camping value, although I do not think the creators of this movie claim this. And yes, as a previous critic mentioned, it's sex with a man in a bear suit. Do not spend a lot of money on this. Try borrowing it, if you have to see it. Or contact me, I'd love to sell you my copy at half price. <br /> <br /> You may have to watch another of this director's films in particular, since he seems to have a certain number of followers. But if it is something like this, I will regret again that another 2 hours of my life are gone forever.
