An unquestionably discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), American before the war and Agatha Christie parody of a big problem: a deadly problem. In addition to the single digit I.Q. the plot and the dialogue, the most surprising aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) tries everything: playing a romantic role (with his appearance! And his age! He and Woody Allen should start a club of ageless comedians, without a mirror), and try to be touching , fun, moving and intelligent, and try to sing and dance, and succeed in NONE! A long drink from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I was having a nearsighted attack, because everyone in the movie keeps saying that Cherry Jones is a very good girl, and that Michael Cumpsty is this amazingly handsome stud !! The boy who plays the male secretary of Claire Bloom is a bald slim actor with glasses as sexy as a chair and is the object of the passion of the two leading ladies! The exaggerated performance of Mike Starr as the most incompetent and phonetic policeman I've ever seen deserves to be among the 10 most abominable performances in recent film history. The saddest note is to see Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely wasted and offensively wasted. At least I expect both stars to pay their bills at home (and then fire their agents) with this failure. No wonder that Sukowa, acting prodigy, returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for her! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to achieve a really bad movie with a very bad script with a crazy casting Director, study this, if not, get away! - 1/10
