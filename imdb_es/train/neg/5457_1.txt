An actor asks: "What is my motivation?" To understand your character. After seeing this "docudrama", this vague and careless farce, the viewer wonders what was the motivation of anyone. <br /> <br /> This inept offspring of daytime television (the Oprah show) lost by a mile the great opportunity to explore. weight problems. <br /> <br /> His characters were all superficial and superficial, his line of history was much less socially redeemed than an episode of the "Simpsons". He portrayed the investigative police gratuitously as unprofessional and incompetent. He did not offer why the court could treat the main character, a child molester, as differently as a male perpetrator would. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman start "preparing" her second grade student? Starting a romance with him when he returned to his sixth grade class? Why did the boy's mother testify in his favor? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generational rationalization and greed. The movie gave no indication of that. <br /> <br /> Why was the viewer not informed that the victim's mother sold the rights to the interviews to print and television newspapers, parading with her teenage son on "The Today Show"? That Mary Kay's attorney charged, herself appealing the status of "Son of Sam" to be able to benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican congressman, the 1972 US independent presidential candidate, the president of the John Birch society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when his own student at a community college discovered he had children. Was he exposed only when that lover mutilated his young son? However, Letourneau's father had withdrawn his many children from "too liberal" Catholic schools, fighting to prevent all schoolchildren from receiving sex education. <br /> <br /> One month after her conditional release, again pregnant at 14 years old. Old's second daughter, Mary Kay, received seven and a half years in prison for numerous probation violations. A prophetic editorial on the sad subject then appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two hours, LeTourneau was taken to jail, and this salacious mixture of beauty made for television was over, until the casting began." br /> <br /> Effectively, 18 months later, the filming of this farce was under way.
