There have been some low moments in my life, when I have been bewildered and depressed. Sitting through Stale Aluminum was one of these. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. Without premiere (even the stars did not want to attend) and without comments in magazines. The only reason I sat down in the movie was hoping I could get some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing was explained in the movie. The narration was idiotic. I was happy at a time when it seemed that the main role of the film had been filmed, then, in the face of my growing desperation, it was revealed that it had not really shot off to muffle my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film is hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mainly moments of unintentional humor. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to free himself manually in a toilet cubicle, while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I will conclude this way. <br /> <br /> Stale aluminum: only for sadists, dumpsters and regressors who want to torture themselves.
