I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie, being the big fan of elvis that I am, and I thought it was a big disappointment. Kurt Russel had most of the "Elvis moves" down and the imitation of the voice was excellent, but the voice bent in Elvis' singing just did not work for me. the voice did not always coincide with the mouth of mussels, and it was hard for me to lose myself in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. Also, there were so many discrepancies in the movie that people who do not know much about Elvis would probably consider them facts. he sang songs before he recorded them in real life, the moment he got his first guitar is wrong, I'm pretty sure his brother Jesse Garron was buried in a tomb without marks, not one with a huge headstone that he read JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a movie for television, but they skipped important events, like the special back, and dragged some scenes for too long. If you want to see a good movie that shows Elvis in his preferential income, THAT'S THE WAY HE IS, or another Elvis concert. Listening and seeing the real preform of Elvis is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement, I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic).
