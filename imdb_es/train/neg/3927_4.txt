A horror story so common about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but it is too far from the Polish filmmaker's film in any possible respect. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" is not at all. <br /> <br /> What is most surprising about this film is the cast: it is full of great names from American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors who act for food (I suppose). <br /> <br /> Verdict: barely entertaining. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
