Well, I've always been a Batman fan. I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman comic from time to time. So, as I can imagine, I got a little excited when I found out about this series and then I was disappointed A LOT. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY ad. There is no depth. And what the hell was with the Joker? Who, in my humblest opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time and they killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. Actually, I would like to be able to say that there was something in this series that was remotely creative or interesting. In short (because, believe me, I could say much more) DO NOT waste your time on this program or on your money.
