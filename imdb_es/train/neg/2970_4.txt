I'm a fan of the Batman movie and television. I loved the program (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as good as some people expected it to be. In my opinion, it is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that I did not have drama. Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this movie is up for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, it's a good Batman movie. But I would only rent it.
