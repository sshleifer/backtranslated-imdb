This was horrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden it makes it look like a rocking horse could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, just as unbearable. Another film that portrays England as full of chocolate box houses and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools other than maybe Hogwarts look like that? The two-year-old police station resembled the Heartbeat set (a nauseating British series in the 1960s). This film could not decide what it wanted to be: a comedy or a serious examination of the currents hidden in the friendships of women. If it had stuck to the above, then the sex scenes in the cemetery and the stupid wedding assault could have worked (I just say). But those scenes just did not work with the tragedy in the second half. It also seems unlikely that Kate will talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. One final note: what does a decent actress like Staunton do in this pile of poop? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell must stick to the advertising wrinkle cream.
