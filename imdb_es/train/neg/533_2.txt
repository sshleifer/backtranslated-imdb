I knew that 'Evening' was a girl movie, so I expected to get bored. A perverse joke in IMDb had said it was a 'movie for girls' but that your partner would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when we left we were both surprised to discover that it had only lasted two hours, it seemed like a night much longer than that! I suppose, for the Yankees, it is supposed to be elevated or fascinating because they are rich people who live on the beach; well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide gallery and a lawn but without apparent lawnmower. If that kind of thing impresses you, it may seem like a fairly short movie. <br /> <br /> There is a Monty Python movie about a Knight who simply will not die. It ends with a twisted whirlwind (why does Yanks add a third syllable to this word that I wonder?) On the way he continues screaming threats to his enemy. This movie is also about a kind of undead. Vanessa Redgrave (name inappropriate for the grave seen here) continues and continues to die while she has an inappropriate guilt. She does not worry about being a bimbo with her eyes open and breathless, but she imagines herself as a murderer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a girl movie, there's a guy who is supposed to be the character of Mr Darcy / Heathcliff. I am not a woofter, so I can not pretend to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious puppet who is expelled by this role seems to have the title of server in his favor. It is a secret without blood. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the main characters are not much police, but the minors manage, incredibly to be much worse. There is a partner whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is pregnant. Fair enough, but it's not Hamlet's role, why are you ruining it so badly? Forgetting that it was a girl movie, I thought they would throw it out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that the mushrooms on his face did not flatter him, but then I realized that she should have encouraged him to grow up. 'beard' because it looked worse without that. <br /> <br /> I kept awake when I realized which actors and actresses had their ear lobes glued or free and I noticed interesting fragments of landscapes: if they drag you, see if you can detect the head of dissected buffalo, exactly the kind of thing you would expect in a beach hut. <br /> <br /> Apart from the mandatory wedding, there is only one action. You would have thought that they would have understood it well. Unfortunately, however, the accident of running over and leaking is carried out by a car that could not be there. When the accident is discovered, the cast approaches to shout for a character that they can not know is close (but we do it as a public). If they do not have the slightest idea that the person is a few miles from the place, why do they wander around aimlessly shouting for him? I guess the director's excuse is that it's supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another element of the stage that caught my attention was a copper-bottomed pan. I did not think that the technology to do this would develop until the 1950s.
