I saw this movie on an American Airlines flight going west. It was so bad that it actually made the flight seem longer. The plot had potential (who would not love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills all Elvis impersonators she knows?) But it was ruined a million times for really poor writing. Towards the end there is a shamefully bad scene where a band of impersonators Elvis is on the roof of a casino sending back the sky thinking that it will return, then a group of stars moves to form a constellation of "Elvis", which he quickly fires a bolt of lightning. of lightning on the imitators, sending them crashing against the ceiling. Bad ... REALLY bad. What is the theme of the whole movie. I would avoid this at all costs.
