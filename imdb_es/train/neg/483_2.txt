I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but I was clearly very wrong. As stated before, this film essentially uses its title character as a starting point; His representation of his life and person has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible - pretentious, forced and insensitive - and its rewriting of events is unusually offensive even in a genre that often makes a living distorting, rather than retelling the story. . Along with some pretty decent designs, the physical charms of Valentina Cervi are the main asset of this film, and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were also aware of this; they do not waste time in creating several "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with stimulation than with the development of the plot or the character. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal can not, and does not, sustain this movie. The performance is nothing special, and the score is too generic despite an interesting chord or two. Photography is fine, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some rather ridiculous sequences that use distorted lens effects more appropriate for a freakout movie of the 1960s than a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often in the body of Artemisia, and very rarely in his paintings. <br /> <br /> In total, an almost complete failure. He's not smart or smart enough to be a serious movie, and he's too slow and pretentious to work like soft core pornography. So the French can fail, after all!
