This is what I would get if I allowed a 10-year-old (manic) child to write a story about a trip to the moon. Absolute garbage without redeeming qualities Perhaps there is something of fascination in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation, I had nothing to do to lose an hour and a half. Save time and money and see BOLT instead. <br /> <br /> Damn it. There are not enough lines, but I think that sums it up ... well, I agree with a previous revision: this is like a cold war propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they had discovered the flies that discovered the deception of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. By the way, why did all the flies of the main character get deformed? - Nobody had the full compliment of the extremities!
