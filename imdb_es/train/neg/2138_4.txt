War, Inc. - Corporations take over the war in the future and use the lone assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their job against rival CEOs. A dark comedy that satirizes military and corporations alike. It was often difficult to understand exactly what was happening. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason or method for madness. <br /> <br /> Cusack considers him to be the "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. That is, war is more or less an imitation. Again we see Cusack as a killer who protects * spoiler * the person he is supposed to kill while facing his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack seems quite credible by pulling out half a dozen men with relative ease. The brief fights look good. The rest of the movie does not. Everything is peculiar, often almost strange. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody, and too optimistic for anyone to think about the message of the film, which I suppose could be the cruel ways in which corporations, like the war factions, compete and dodge without a drop of consideration. How they affect average citizens. Interesting, but the satire simply does not work because it is not funny and in its heart the film does not have a heart. We're supposed to worry about how the war affects Cusack's character instead of the millions of lives shattered by the war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack offers a decent performance. His character sucks hot sauce shots and manages the smallest private jet, but the quirks are meant to replace the character traits. Marisa Tomei is slumming like the romantic journalist. There really is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and is not fooled. Joan Cusack just screams and moans and fights. Blech Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he does not start delivering a decent performance over and over again. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you have to ask "War, what's the use?" Absolutely nothing. DO-
