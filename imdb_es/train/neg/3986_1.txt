When I refer to Malice as a black cinema, I do not compare it with masterpieces like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor am I comparing director Becker with Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I am simply registering a protest against the darkness that permeates this film from beginning to end, to the extent that most of the time it simply can not distinguish what is happening. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, so I do not understand. However, as it is, it would not have made much difference if director Becker had filmed it in total darkness.
