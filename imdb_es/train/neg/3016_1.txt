I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott's movies. When this movie came out, I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To discover that the movie is the furthest from it! The story was stepping on water from the beginning, and choosing Mickey Rourke was not a good idea. And all the 'arm'scene' was too free! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Kiera Kinghtly, and this film reveals that she will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst performances in history. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's address, but this takes all the cake! I'm sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
