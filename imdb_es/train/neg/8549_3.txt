Well, what kind of TRASH have I been seeing now? "The Mountain of the Witches" has to be one of the most incoherent and far-fetched Spanish exploitation films in history and, at the same time, it is also strangely convincing. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt that there is ever a script to work with, but somehow I could not turn it off. Scratching your head with confusion starts immediately, with an opening sequence about an angry girl who killed her mother's cat. So, do you think this movie revolves around children possessed by evil forces? Heck not, because after this introduction, the girl and her wickedness are simply no longer mentioned. Then cut off a boy, with the most impressive mustache you've ever seen, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a subtle way. When she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he quickly calls his employer and asks for any kind of assignment! Great movement The film finally begins now, while traveling to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. Although not before, he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and topless photography! Throughout your trip, all sorts of strange events happen that? Did you guess? they never explain themselves. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, the petrifying music is heard everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, loading the witches? Apparently, a group of silent witches own the mountains and practice voodoo with the intruders. That's as close as I can describe the plot, but there's a good chance it's far away. More important here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is occasionally very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography. All supporting characters seem strange and the dazzling Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured script.
