I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I felt cheated, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I have found a holy grail, a true touchstone of bad cinema. If you think dramatic opening shots of an empty stadium fail with the awkward monologue of Evel's camera address, then wait until the opening credits move on the driver's butt. The script seems to be stuck with press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ... I just can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. It seems that it has absolutely no connection with what it says, the only internal monologue I can detect is "My God, I bet you think I'm cute, very cute!" This is an epiphany! Now I know how bad it can be put.
