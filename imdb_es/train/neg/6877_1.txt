I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and ended up seeing one about the Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see the 50% who live in poverty. When I see people with difficulties, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no Spanglish ... or you speak Spanish, or not ... and from what I've heard ... no. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. The rest is as crazy as Osama bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want some proof for all of you, dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico, visit Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all of South America, Central America and Mexico. It has worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary is about the Nuyoricans and their struggles. <br /> <br /> To the person who says that there was not enough Africa in the program ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will create one shortly for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... to all the ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the US. UU And they want to know how the prime minister handles things. This is not a good documentary about the Puerto Rican culture. Tell your children to pay attention in the Geography and History class. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." It was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if it was what we all felt. It should have been titled ... "I'm Nuyorican ... lunche ... I can not speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATE WITH THE PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God, do not let them play this on the island.
