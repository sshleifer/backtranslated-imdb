This movie is like the material of S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and, if Trueblood had been a product of either, the results could have been much better (especially in the actors department). . Instead, we get a pretty bad mediocrity, fun. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumor, I guess that's the most accurate description. This happened in the days of action movies that they used to boys of 40 and 30 years old and dressed them with threads oilers or some sort of more effeminate selection of gang attire and fought for the bad music of the 80s. However, Ray is the only caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), whom he is forced to inexplicably leave behind in a train station when, running away from the police, he is caught and forced to meet the time in the Marine Corps. We go to the present and Ray is back in the city and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's adversary and now the old scores must be resolved violently (and, again , the cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor was defended in the sense of the action movie, before Ray can continue life at a normal pace with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br For the most part, the movie is pretty ridiculous - for me, most of it has to do with too much exaggeration, though not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn, who plays the waitress she befriends. of the gang and Lowe himself seem to make some unnecessary exaggerations like those on New York street, although the biggest one to hang on is recycled weft lines and maybe a kind of film that has already passed its peak as a product of 1989.
