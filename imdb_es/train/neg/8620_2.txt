He was not sure if Andy Sidaris could or could not repeat his success with the hit film "Malibu Express." With his film Fit to Kill, he showed that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. The argument written by Sidaris, which was ungrateful for the Academy, is a complex script that involves many invisible twists and turns. The main characters composed the work for a radio station based on the sex known as KSXY. Intelligently, KSXY is actually your secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they face their nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most precious diamonds. A well written script is not everything, the excellent performance of the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. Reviewed by critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in the coming years. Now he is suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but in the future, undoubtedly, he will be recognized. I am disappointed that no circle of critics has recognized the cinematographic characteristic of Andy Sidaris. The costumes, the special effects, all help to complement this already beautiful piece of cinema. You may do the best you can to ignore the sad score of 3 in this movie and go rent it out for yourself. My personal score is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the box office hit of Runaway Bride, and the action is better or the same as the film masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
