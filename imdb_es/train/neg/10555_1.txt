First of all: I love good Splatter films and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget movie is nothing like that! The image quality is very low, the soundtrack is the most annoying I've heard (and as for FX) ... well, the super low quality makes some of them not look as bad as they should be. in a real movie (what this crap is not here). No concept, a thin plot, a primitive performance and a weird dialogue. I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each repeated about 20 times ... the same for many movie sequences (it may be an indication of what kind of audience this shit was made!) The story seems to be that Child had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, he was psychologically damaged and as an adult he goes on tour, performing a demonstration of self-mutilation. So far, all right ... But for these pseudo-director-makers, this plot is just a line to stage scenes of shock produced at low cost that have no message or meaning (the intestines just removed are thrown on a woman naked and tied to a dirt hole ... why, and why is the only time you see the woman and the pitcher in all the bloody "movie")? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? Do not! Artistically? DO NOT!!!!! All those who confuse this cheap gore-show for art should visit their psychiatrist as soon as possible or should see "The Wall" by Pink Floyd to see how a similar theme can be solved in an ingenious way ... I hope this is your first and last movie (!!!!!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And everything in the world, remember: not everything that seems cheap and obviously has no meaning is automatically "Art" ...
