I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I like almost all British comedies (well ... maybe it's not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some I did not understand), but this League of Gentlemen is a good thing to make you sick. This show was good in some way; It helped me lose some weight because seeing this piece of garbage makes me feel like I'm not hungry anymore. This is really disgusting, sick and not even fun TV show and I wonder who is laughing at these things. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting to see the men dressed in the yellow-haired woman and urinate in the car ... I mean ... what's funny about that? It makes me want to throw up. Without humor, only disturbing and cheap images, the bathroom laughs ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go ahead ... look at it ... but, to be honest, people look and enjoy. This must have some emotional problems. Trash.
