I saw this movie as a preview of an art exhibit by Matthew Barney. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibition and, in retrospect, I probably should have. <br /> <br /> Apart from the excellent score (Bjork) and the rich and colorful photography, the content was mostly tedious and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone with pearls to find out what the divers were doing. The film was mainly a silly mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology that were used in a simulated hunt / harvest. The movie "reaches its peak", with enough free crash art to make your stomach win. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? While others might argue that it is a piece against whaling, one could also argue that it somehow also justifies whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "flash" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-mutilation and cannibal fetishes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Unless you really realize Barney's sense of art, don't bother watching this movie. The message is obscure, the pace slow and pretentious cultural references. If you're looking for a crash technique, you'll do better in one of the many "Undead" movies or chase an old copy of Hustler and you'll receive a cartoon of fecal matter.
