This movie is so horrible. So bad that I can not bear to spend anything more than a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are promulgated correctly. A lot of images of slaughterhouse. Cortes and strange editions. There is no continuity to the plot. The performance is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb of a movie was obviously made to earn some money without taking into account the accuracy of its content. The work of the camera is out of focus at times and is always unstable. It seems that it was filmed on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader with life in prison, I'd like them to put the guys who made this horrible movie in prison too. . <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about looking at this one. I would give a negative star if I could.
