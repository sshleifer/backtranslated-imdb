This could have been a very good movie, if I could have seen it. The handheld camera was very inflatable. From the first credits I was worried. Several of us who saw it felt very nauseous at the end. But we stayed until the end because it was such a lovely and interesting movie, which gave an idea of ​​young pop culture in South Africa. The film in black and white did enhance the artistic feeling of it. The performance seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogues were a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to have the most fun. However, if you have dizziness, you can seriously consider skipping this movie. It is picturesque, but not worth the nausea.
