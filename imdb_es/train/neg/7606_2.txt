Beverly Garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress before her time, bringing power and grace even to films as bad as the Corman films she starred in. In Gunslinger, she is the town sheriff's wife. He leaves, so she takes over her job to pursue her killers. She is better than the material she is working with, by far. The film is gray, lined, and above all boring. There's some humor (unintentional) with tire tracks everywhere, people running behind one building to suddenly emerge in front of another (I've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And the plot truly Stupid of the newly widowed Sheriff falls in love with the man hired to kill her. Even if she had not loved her husband, it had only been a week or two since she died! And she ends up shooting the guy at the end, anyway. Without luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is another woman, the owner of a room. She is thinking of buying a lot of land in case the railway goes through it and makes her rich. If she does not, her plan of action is pretty slim: she will simply steal everything she can from the city and go to the trash. Hell, it's just her and her weapon hired at the end against an entire town. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? Look what happened in the real cities of the Old West when the bank robbers entered to rob the bank, then they were cut by the armed and dangerous people in a hail of bullets. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk and nonsense, interspersed with a few loose shootings. The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman movie, although, thank God, it lacks moral proselytism at the end of It Conquered the World. The sheriff handed his badge to Sam Bass and left for sunset, although the film was so gray that the sun was never seen.
