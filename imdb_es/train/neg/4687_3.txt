SPOILERS (ALTHOUGH NONE THAT DOES NOT REVEAL IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE MOVIE) <br /> <br /> Actually, Robin Williams is pretty good at this as the friendly, lonely and emotionally disturbing Sy. He is a very human psychopath, even sympathetic, and really disappears in the character, it is not a feat for such a recognizable artist. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rest of the movie is a waste. Supporting performances (and performers) would not look out of place in a soft-core pornography (it does not help that all characters, except Sy, are made of 100% cardboard). Sometimes, the director seems to be trying to thwart the suspense: we know from the first moments a) that Sy is a complete nutcase, b) that he survives and c) that the police catch him. finish. So all we have left to reflect on is how and why, and the answers provided are not so interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is laborious and artificial, and presents some nonsensical moments (for example, the husband berates his wife for his expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time in the supermarket local discount). Approximately two-thirds of the way, Sy does something so irremissibly stupid that it makes you wonder how much you really care about your grand plan of revenge. And the final clich√© explanation of his psychosis, taken from 'Peeping Tom', is a terrible episode. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is the worst kind. It is not overwritten, nor uncomfortable, nor incredible, nor bad in any other way that can be considered fun, even for lovers of bad movies. Instead, each line is purely, horribly functional, it is as if the director gave a sketch of the plot to a newspaper editor of the newspaper and said: "Hey, I need a viable script for this - in an hour". It made me want to scream, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a reminder of the care-giving thrillers of the eighties and nineties (`The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, for example) And while it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. Sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable, but on its own it's not enough to make the movie work. In the end, the lack of craftsmanship of all involved, except Robin Williams, sinks this. 3 out of 10
