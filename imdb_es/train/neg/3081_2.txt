Good grief While I still maintain that Hands: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, the Hobgoblins came terribly close. This ... this ... insults the public at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this was a struggle to overcome. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me, alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a fan of MST3K and you have committed to see each experiment, think twice about seeing this. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
