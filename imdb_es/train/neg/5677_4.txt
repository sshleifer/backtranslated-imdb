"Seed" is a porno torture ... there's no doubt about that. But, strangely enough, Uwe Boll has written, produced and directed a more refined film than any he has done in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a Boll movie, I feel that some pages of The script must have disappeared. There are simply huge gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense, either. Movies are somewhat surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why do the six policemen who are going to arrest Seed split up and leave? How do they separate when they arrive at the dark residence, unlike the real policemen who would enter and clear the house in pairs or in groups of three? Why do the police never use their radios? How can bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? (I KNOW it's a time-lapse photograph ... but Seed could never meet his program by killing people if he would always wait for the previous victim to decompose to the point shown). How is it that Seed puts on a bib and a mask while waiting in death row instead of the typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, walk through the block of cells and then leave again without being arrested or noticed? If about 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) have been killed, why is only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should look for Seed in Seed's house, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? (Did not you think about doing this before?) Why does the police detective do it alone, without backup and without even letting the office know what he was doing and where he was going? <br /> <br /> This is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously does his best to make sure we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spends several minutes on the screen to set this up, when he could have dedicated them to making other aspects of the movie at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the film serves as a framework for some varied scenes (perhaps Boll would think of these as his " visions ") of a brutal death by blows, shots to the head, execution by electrocution, and skinning of live animals raised for their skins. (The initial scenes of animals that were skinned were really unnecessary and unsettling, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film). The centerpiece is, without a doubt, the blunt death of a middle-aged woman by Seed with an ax. It's obvious that he spent a lot of time on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", although without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are an enthusiast of the porn torture genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of porn torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is quite unpleasant and may be disgusting at some points, it is actually much more competent than most of Boll's films. Maybe he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that it will progress beyond porno torture and continue further in the "Postal" line.
