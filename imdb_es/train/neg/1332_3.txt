The novelty of hearing clear, four-letter words from Jay Leno is the only memorable aspect of this bullish formula of police buddies that do not match. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-faced comedian joins Pat Morita to track down a stolen turbocharger prototype (do you think Leno car lover played a hand in the plot?). The two tracks try hard, they really do, but Leno is not an actor and Morita's routine out of water is aging in a hurry. The movie has a bit of 1980s appeal, but its valuable moments become increasingly scarce as its 100 minute run time is completed. Fans of Leno's considerable comedic talents will be disappointed; everyone else will simply get bored
