"Horrible people" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people doing common things, look out the window at real life. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing boring things, you'll have to watch this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. The characters talk long, but never manage to communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh thinks that all of us are as inefficient and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. But we are not, and he failed.
