I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cursed and acting effects. The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the child who plays Brian. What a geek! I could not believe the mullet! Then it was talking to himself. I guess they could not just make the movie silent, but still. Of course they had to have it too thin, not something they wanted to see. But Jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. Everything, from the bear to the shock, was something I could do myself, and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production, since the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer has read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie reeked like a smelly goat.
