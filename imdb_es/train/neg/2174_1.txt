It's hard to believe that people like this dreck! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it's the kind of movie that parents can not stand. A predictable plot, the boring Belushi and possibly the worst child actor of all time. I will give the principal part of the responsibility for the child, but she was really painful to watch. I feel embarrassed for her now, let people know that it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound, then I came here and found out they did it because she won Star Search. I have always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to exchange the name of his wonderful and sadly lost brother, and this shit shows why. Zero stars.
