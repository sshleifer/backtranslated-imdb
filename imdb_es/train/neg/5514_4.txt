I do not know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the interaction (often violent) between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leave Tom behind to have an adventure in New York, and as far as I'm concerned, he definitely suffers from a lack of cat! <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry's exploration of the Big Apple 'might be for the other T & J fans who have commented here on IMDb, I could not wait for this indulgent rubbish to end, so I could see the next caricature on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost "buys the farm", hanging precariously from the end of a broken sail, hundreds of feet above a busy road.
