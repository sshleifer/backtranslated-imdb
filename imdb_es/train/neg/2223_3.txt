Trivial, cliche dialogues and plots (the same kind of things we saw throughout the 80's fantasy movies), hokey music and characters to paint by numbers that get it out of the way for everyone, except for the most hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What saves this film from the scrap heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscope and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. The violence is spectacular and the direction of art and animation are different from any other film of swords and witchcraft of the time. <br /> <br /> I like to see this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack of Conan's first movie.
