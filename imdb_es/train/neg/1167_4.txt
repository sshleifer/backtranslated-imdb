I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it just did not work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's output and I have found that it is very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some ingenious sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these qualities are painfully rare in Alive. The plot is great, if not all the original, and could have made for a very beautiful movie. Unfortunately, the pace is very slow and the film takes an age to get going before reaching quite predictable places. The action is almost passable, with the final fight quite good and the previous one on OK. The previous one is also marred by the speeding of camera work, which makes it less consistent. There are some visual effects ordered and some interesting ideas that float in the dialogue, but the film still creeps very badly. The characters are not well developed or well acted, and the configuration and overall color scheme is monotonous and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, maybe the intelligent use of the fast forward button could improve it. With about twenty minutes removed from the execution time, this could be a pretty decent sci-fi thriller. But the film is boring. Only recommended to the very patient and determined fans of Kitumura.
