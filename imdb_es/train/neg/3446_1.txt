This film on paper looked like it could be good, after seeing it, I realized that this movie was completely terrible! The plot does not make sense, and I think I counted the best part of 5000 scenes cut each, which makes the film more boring and ridiculous. I saw this black night tone without any noise, just to add SCARINESS, but the truth is that the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, play opera, I mean it! This film summarizes everything that is not good about this type of film. To be honest, do not say more, but look at your own risk, this movie is a complete garbage. ENJOY!
