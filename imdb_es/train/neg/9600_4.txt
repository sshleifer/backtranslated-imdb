Very strange, but occasionally elegant exploitation film with no real story, but which benefits from its incredibly dazzling main actress and a handful of nice and horrifying makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl in her twenties, who carries with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of an ancestor who is said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly meeting and shows up at a hospital. However, he escapes again and randomly devours more men while he runs away from police detectives, doctors and relatives. Everything is beautiful to watch and listen to (a really great soundtrack), but the absence of argument and continuity becomes irritating rather quickly. Luckily, the protagonist Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills the boring moments by dancing naked around a bonfire. The film is too long, too strange and forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of nowhere, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his film was based on real events. Yeah sure...
