"Back of Beyond" takes place in a restaurant / dive service station in the middle of the Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a trouble place when some visitors arrive unexpectedly . We get what, at first, confusingly looks like a flashback in which he and his sister (although their relationship to each other is better understood later in the movie) are accelerating through the desert on their motorcycle. Then, he appears as a terribly quiet character and, sometimes, in a bad mood in the presence of newcomers. <br /> <br /> We know one thing is certain and that is the kind of spiritual sense of McGregor, his vision of danger and for example, his clairvoyance is only a little relevant to the story, most of which concerns three diamond thieves whose car breaks down and who trust Tom to help them get out of their place without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls in love with one of the thieves, a young girl named Charlie, and suddenly confronts the three distrustful allies with each other. But not in a way that really results in something of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to build something meaningful, but it really does not. Even the ending, which unfolds like a trivial bonfire tale (and one that really reveals many narrative flaws), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth trying if you do not. Consider the terribly slow pace, but you're in the mood, at least, for something a little different than usual.
