The film begins with a promise, but it remains too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We were hanging, but nothing else, except the languid planes of serious and thoughtful masculine faces to savor. Certainly, there is no rope on the wall to help us climb. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We wonder why a loving couple, neither a father nor a child, should be so far away from the real world that their own world is preferable. When claustrophobic beyond imagining. This loss of presence in the real world contrasts, quite obviously and unnecessarily, with the fact that the son has enlisted in the armed forces. Why not the circus, so that at least we can appreciate some color? We are left with a great sense of loss, but unfortunately there is no lighting, which is disconcerting given that, apparently, the film is about some kind of achievement that is not available to all of us.
