Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he's one of the most interesting people a movie has ever made, but he certainly did his share of clunkers. This is just another one of those. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz, a doctor who has had his medical license withdrawn for unexplained reasons. However, he is doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. She has revealed that she is between 70 and 80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in her mid 50's, so the reason she is married to this old woman is never really explained. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are married at the altar a kind of sweet-smelling substance by which they faint, but they are believed to be dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the morgue and take him back to his laboratory, where he remains in some kind of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then, the stolen brides have a needle stuck in it. Somewhere in their bodies, maybe the neck, and then the needle crashes into the body of Lugosi's wife to return her to youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi puts the needle or what it takes from the brides, but somehow he restores his wife. Apparently, old age makes you scream in pain because of Lugosi. The wife screams a lot until she returns to her younger state. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie ... an old weird witch and her two deformed children ... a son is a great slow-motion type of action that seems lumpy who likes to caress sleeping brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf ... small, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three simply pile up and sleep in the gloomy Lugosi. laboratory below. Who are these 3 and how they became the frightened helpers of Lugosi is that, like many things in this movie, they are never explained. <br /> <br /> So anyway, a reporter does her homework. editor to find out where all the stolen brides will go. She quickly realizes the only thing common among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid found in them. So he asks and is told that there is a world-renowned orchid expert who lives nearby and who is the only one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be a creepy doctor, Dr. Lorenz. She follows him quickly and annoys her small house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were during all this, but they came to sweep after the reporter had done all the work. dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's films always had some kind of unnecessary stupid plot that only made everything stink in the high skies. I refer to a world-renowned orchid expert who kidnaps brides by sending them a doping. Orchid is known to have developed itself? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it turns out that the ladies do not even have to be girlfriends for the procedure to work, so why would Lugosi continue to kidnap girlfriends from heavily guarded churches for their experiments and create? All the attention and press headlines? Why not take a prostitute out of the street like a perverted weirdo would? This idiot reminded me a lot of another smelly Lugosi, "The Devil Bat" ... the same silly plot and bad acting and the same silly "reporter gets bad". <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good, he is scary enough and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him. The woman who plays the reporter was just a terrible actor ... she did not have any emotion at all, she just delivered her lines like a machine gun, spitting them out as fast as she could. Everyone else did quite well, too, when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is visible, if only for Bela Lugosi fans. Yugoslavia was always like that. intense even when the image was a dog. He should have known he was taking terrible pictures, but perhaps he also knew that if he gave everything he had, a little of that intensity could shine beyond all the bad plots and bad performances that surrounded him. . <br /> <br /> And he was right: we, the fans of horror, will always love Bela Lugosi. He gave everything forever. I was facing the camera. We give you two f ** ks, Bela.
