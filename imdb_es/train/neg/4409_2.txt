Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by the gender pillar Andrew V. McLaglen, is that a wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith fights with the bandit of Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fist fights, shootings, stagecoach thefts and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking in a low and monotonous tone, Keith is killed with a prostitute (something like a shock after his career in television's "Family Affair"), but otherwise, this low-income material wastes Keith's kindly talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who seems not to notice or not care. Hacking address, poor writing and several funny little lowball humor attempts. * since ****
