I entered this movie after seeing the 82 minute "Borat" tonight, and I left quite disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and I will usually watch animated movies. That said, I found my head off and in a moment I almost left, but I kept waiting for the film to improve. Never happened. <br /> <br /> The images are impressive and the voice work is first class, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times that the villain lizard with bulb was Gandalf and magneto ). The problem with this movie for me is that it is one of those animated features for the ADD set. It is recorded after the fact as a Zany slapstick routine after another, loaded by a plot full of molasses that extracts each stop in an attempt to transmit an "Important Message". It looks a lot like Oscar bait destroyed in the animated category, and considering how it is scoring with critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy makes a mistake and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for a nice animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
