"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. The "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from programs like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show simply does not work. This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and should not be more than a bad joke. Lick Zero stars
