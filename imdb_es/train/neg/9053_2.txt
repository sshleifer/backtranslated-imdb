I just found the TV show "Mash" trivial, preached, oh, always so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the biggest sin of all, and that's it,? which is (was) incredibly boring. You have Alan Alda as the main character, "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his cunning, that it really made me feel uncomfortable to even try to sit down in an episode. The original series included both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, who will gladly admit that they had a certain style and style in the presentation of their character. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, together and singular, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, who also seemed bored, not because of him was not a wonder, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie, looked tired and acted as the show went on. Watching a show a year showed me that. Jamie Farr was just a low-brow "comedy" and it's not even worth mentioning here. The reason why I did not give it a (one) rating, so anyone reading this now would be asking, is that ratings of any kind are not just a subjective call, but also relative. Television, with the exception of relatively few exceptions, is so bad. In relative terms, Mash had some quality of production (according to television standards) of that era and of today, and therefore, deserves two. Rob Ritter
