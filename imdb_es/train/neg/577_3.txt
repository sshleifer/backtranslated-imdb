First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in the place in a vampire movie. Along with the other less interesting characters and the poor story, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you have that in mind and you're a fan of vampire movies, you can have fun with some of the scenes. Do not expect tarantino-style chapters here or a story by Anne Rice. (I hope I have forgotten the whole movie for tomorrow;)
