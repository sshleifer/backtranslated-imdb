When we were in high school, some of us, from time to time, were going to throw stink bombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers, directors and the cast of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and STILL are activating them. <br /> <br /> Like the previous critic who wondered if the cast was anxious to get off the stage and return home, I doubt that more than one shot was made for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, hot on "Mighty Aphrodite" and another top rated film, seems to have been undervalued in this project. His performance does not exist, it is mainly limited to melancholic looks that are supposed to indicate how "sensitive" it is to the plight of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you: do not do it. the next victim Get away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good photos of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, offering a mix of poorly made dialogues with "Spanish" shame accents worthy of the best high school Production theatrical.
