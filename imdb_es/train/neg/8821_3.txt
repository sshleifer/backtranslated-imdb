Why, oh, why do not they learn? When you have a nice and juicy exploitation trick, use it! Do not dwell on trying to be deep and reflective; You're just going to end up looking silly. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much of Mommy kissing (dad dressed as) Santa Claus when he returned. he was a boy So, of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas and, finally, when his disappointment becomes too great, he turns around, dresses like Santa Claus and walks around the city handing out toys to small children, and brutally killing anyone you consider naughty. <br /> <br /> Pretty simple, and it's not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other Christmas-themed horror movies use the same scheme?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more "Santa Claus, portrait of a serial killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent documenting Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when he would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were available. You know that a slasher movie is in trouble when it is encouraging the killer to simply move on. <br /> <br /> Maybe the descent into Harry's madness could have been convincing in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only movie, and it shows. The action jumps vertiginously from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear visions of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are watching. <br /> <br /> Even once the movie starts to roll, we are still cared for a lot of help with self-pity, insecurity and Harry's neurotic behavior. More depressing than terrifying, Christmas Evil is one to avoid.
