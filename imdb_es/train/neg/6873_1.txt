The television productions in early 2000 were between weak and bad. Before brands like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk), the TV was not yet successful, which could capture the attention and interests of the viewer of the 2000s. Titles like (Relic Hunter) , (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to see and follow them, or at least they were not as captivating and interesting as all of them. Time as what preceded them. (Special unit 2) was not the exception. In fact, Men in Black meets the parody of The X Files! (As if these were special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; It did not work well It was promising; At that time there was some saturation of the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X files, so the natural spirit also cheats maliciously (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or a strong one when it comes to making a comic science fiction show. It was highly ridiculous, where, for example, every sexy situation must become an unpleasant and unpleasant situation. I enjoyed that sickly bad taste. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and, for the most part, unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was languid. Of course the show had a fun aspect, but in general it was a work without grace. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among the other works of (Evan Katz) as co-writer and co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24) after, this must be a low point! Despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly joke for most of the time. Therefore, if that was the goal, they made one of the dumbest ones! And, in truth, it would be one of the rarest moments to be grateful for the cancellation of a program only after 19 episodes!
