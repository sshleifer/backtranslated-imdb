This is just a bad movie. With what appeared to be a good budget, it had the potential to be much better. It almost was. With the beautiful heroine almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's boring and it's hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart from John Rhys-Davies flying in a duel like those warriors in Hero or the aforementioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm really ashamed of poor John. He is, after all, a good actor and deserves much better. Just like you, so if you still have a chance, just look at something else.
