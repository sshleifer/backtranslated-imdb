The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: there is real chaos on the set, a producer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, the cool guy has been the director (Mickey Rourke), the bad temper Star , etc. You've seen everything before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time the film simply repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. Without climax, without dramatic development, without good acting, not even with bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. In total, that makes 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
