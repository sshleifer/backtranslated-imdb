Strange shot in the Cinderella story. A terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner becomes a pretty decent performance of an evil stepmother. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive in some parts, but that's it. Period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Move on until you see something interesting and save the full 90 minutes of nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story, I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Crystal Slipper".
