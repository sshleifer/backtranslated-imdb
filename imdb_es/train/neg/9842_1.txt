It seems that everyone in this movie is channeling Woody Allen. They stutter and stop and stutter a little more. Only for DeNero fans REALLY foolish! It tries to appear as avant-garde and artistic, but it seems like a very low budget movie made by university students. The word most used throughout the film is "buzzing". However, the film is linked to the atmosphere of the late sixties and early seventies. If you like the movies in which people talk CONSTANTLY, the horrible lighting (even if it's for "art"), and it makes you feel like you're in a political meeting, then maybe you like this, but I need to be really boring. I found this CD in the dollar container and now I know why.
