Kim Basinger plays Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she is at the local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping. After placing a hate note hastily scribbled on a piece of paper and sticking the paper on the windshield of a car that occupied two parking lots, he discovers that the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains made up of a white man, a Mexican, a Chinese and a black. They confront her for the note, they put a helpless security guard, and the chase is under way. During the course of the film, Della will go from hunt to hunter while unleashing her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. The performance was good enough (except for a few scenes, although the part of "Why God?" Was worthy of pity for its evil). It melts a little due to the fact that the villains that Della pursues are stunned. . If they had not had the intellect of any "solitary boy" given, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the reaction it evokes. The factor of disbelief that I am willing to ignore, since both the director and one of the producers had a part in bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a film that, although it showed credibility through the window, was very funny) . This film, although it never reached the heights of that film, was good in its own rights. <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Comment with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a 'Making-of' of 25 and a half minutes; a trailer and two TV spots for this movie; and trailer of Lower Learning
