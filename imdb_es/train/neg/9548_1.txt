I can not believe I've seen this waiting for more. Start well. This movie pushes the limits of reality very far !! At least the first one was realistic. He starts the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. However, he has a good message, BEWARE OF THE BIG BROTHER! The movie simply makes it look like Big Brother is much bigger than it really is. That was very aggravating. Even the makeup of the actors was completely bad. Some of the performances are quite good. However, some of the acting is really bad. The script was good at some points and completely messy elsewhere. This movie plays for convenience every five minutes. Like I said, I can not believe I've seen him waiting for more. I think I'll appear in the original to go back to earth ... Q
