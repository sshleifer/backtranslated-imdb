What a tangled mess. A while ago I saw him with a friend and we both considered ourselves open to the many wonders of the cinema, but certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although there might very well be some good Ideas / concepts and certainly there are some good performances (under the circumstances), everything is buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony extracts too much from the same group of genes as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films when it comes to editing, or maybe he saw himself in Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he often has a method for madness. <br /> <br /> His quote to claim that he made the movie as a joke says it all. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
