Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before inheriting $ 25 million. His uncle has paid 3 women, Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and make sure he does not get involved with the gold prospectors. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene at the disapproval of the women. We follow the story as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of the role of accompanist they agreed to carry out during the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and the other ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are bad in this movie. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good either. It's nice enough, but it only comes alive when you play the drums or the trombone. There is a very irritating character who plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is boring.
