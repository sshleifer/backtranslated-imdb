This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies that Stallone has ever made. This is a typical movie from the 80s in which a single man destroys the entire army by himself. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to the "Command" of Schwarzenegger, but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist, while here you have a specific nation that is shown as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It is true that this was the height of the Cold War, but I am fed up with the fact that the Communists or the Nazis always show themselves as enemies. There are so many American films that have this in common. Why can not there be a movie that shows Americans as the enemy? Who will believe that a single soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think something like this really happened? From what you see, an average American viewer with brainwashing would certainly do it.
