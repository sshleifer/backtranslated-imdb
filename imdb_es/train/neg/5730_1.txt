Where to start? The horrendous performance? The plot without meaning? The gangue effects of the basement? The completely disgusting characters? The choppy edition? The Casio keyboard that induces headache? The shamefully racist comments ("Look at it, Charlie!", "Stand back, Jackie Chan!") The constant misogyny? I am a fan of the horror of a lifetime, and I have no problem with the current "torture-a" However, this is a piece of junk badly done, I think I suffered more pain when I saw that the characters died in it! If you like girls who are forced to eat sauteed penises, really poor. Soft core of porn and lines of thought like "I'll find that b **** and staple your c *** closed!" are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> Insofar to me, I feel the need to wash my eyes with the oven cleaner to avoid seeing this film again.
