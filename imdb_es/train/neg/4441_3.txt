"Triumph of love" is proof that it is not worth seeing all the authors of Comédie-Française who use the procession disguised as costumes like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a playwright inspired by Commedia Dell Arte, of whom Brittannica says: "His nuanced feeling and his clever play on words became known as marivaudage " <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino has fun hanging three mixed romances, the role of her pants was not up to Cherubino in "Marriage of Figaro". <br /> <br /> The jerky herky edition is annoying and seems to indicate that it took many takes for each long speech. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as the deceived old maid, as well as the costumes. <br /> <br /> The flashes of the audience we see and the closing curtain to wink, is that all this is really false. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 05/29/2002)
