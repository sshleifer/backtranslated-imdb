... And I never thought that a movie deserved to be awarded a 1! But this is honestly the worst movie I've seen in my life. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the correct story from the DVD box seemed pretty predictable. It is not a mystery, nor a youth film. It does not include any sensuality, if that is what the title could have suggested remotely. This is just a total no-no. Do not waste your time or money unless you want to see a group of young people in a Gothic setting of the same kind as adults, where a killer pursues them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth seeing. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Stahl.
