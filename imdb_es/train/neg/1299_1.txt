This production has absolutely no history. The acting is shameful. The promising star of Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand should not add this movie to her CV. His performance is far from impeccable and, personally, I think he has crossed the limits of professional decency; In relation to the way it is exposed in this movie. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and rude language. It also shows an incorrect image of the Netherlands (like most movies). Do not bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and a shameful record for Hilbrand, which has proven to be better when it's close to the screen.
