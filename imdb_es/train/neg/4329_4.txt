I will never forget the ingenuity and great comedy of the holiday movie ORIGINAL! The lines, rhythm and timing of the events in that movie are exceptional! However, this sequel to European Vacation is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the Griswald win a European Vacation in a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a flight attendant on an airplane asks Clark: "Do you want your coke in the can?" Clark answers: "No, I'll have it right here." It really is the only line that is funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> European Vacation's mood is tense. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to rewrite a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous sequence of chasing sticks of slaps towards the end of the picture just to kill the weather. <Br /> <br /> Worse, the standout natural comedians like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. Their replacements are not fun, they can not act, and they seem to be going through the motions most of the time. There are also some crude jokes and comments about sex that are not only fun, but bad taste. <br /> <br /> The Griswald should have stayed at Wally World. The place that made them legends! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Spectators should return to see the original holiday movie instead! You'll be glad you did it.
