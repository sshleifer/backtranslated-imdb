Now, what about the actors who took part in that shit? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? He liked it there ... Well, whatever, what can you expect from a movie with one of Baywatch's lifeguards at the helm? Nothing, and that's what we have. None of the characters is nice, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a joke (very bad). There is no logic whatsoever for what is happening. I got the feeling that the filmmakers were trying out a kind of "Attack of Killer Tomatoes." Especially in the scene where all the important people discussed national security in some kind of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, change the channel: your TV will thank you.
