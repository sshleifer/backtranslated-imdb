Basically, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was an ingenious and beautifully acted movie with several twists of truly winning characters. Seeing the Detectives does not have any of that. <br /> <br /> The premise of a geek in a video store that a mysterious extravagant drags on his feet is a good one, but never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the misuse of the contacts, not to mention the lack of a real visual narrative style. I mean, this movie focuses on MOVIES, but it's incredibly uncinematic! That is a major flaw right there. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) do not make them true or understanding in any way. real form. So the movie becomes a series of episodes involving two people that look, well, not terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is not terribly romantic either. <br /> <br /> So avoid it. Even in its 90 minutes of runtime, it's just not worth sitting down ...
