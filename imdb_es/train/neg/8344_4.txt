After reading all the favorable comments about this film and some that give it a little more. Finally I decided to throw in my value of no cents. I agree with the majority at the point that if it had not been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all the real talent fled south on I-77 years ago, at least as far as a gas tank would allow. I received a chuckle from the reviewers who subtly affirm that they get a little better than most when they say they followed the plot without a hint of confusion. This little story by Brothers Crook is like an old record with a jump on it. As an American, I understand the difficulties that Ind film artists face. A trip to Romania would have erased the insurance budget. Let's face it, this whole movie was a loop loop from Claire at the gas station, Claire at the side of the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire at the house, Claire at the cornfield, Claire at the school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous and I would have done it if she had not been the best actress in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living but they do not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty movies. Before writing another script about dreaming about ghosts, watch one or two episodes of Ghost Whisperer or something like that and know a bit of history. All the cast, except the aforementioned and a couple of others, participated in their first and last film. In addition, there is an appearance of co-director Jeff as it is in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, huh? One thing that the film had in its favor is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation with the derriere of Lauren Lewis. Well, with all the sarcasm already satisfied, I still recommend the movie for horror lovers only to see this young actress at the formative moment of her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain that is worth seeing .
