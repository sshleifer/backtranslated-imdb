Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, particularly from "Down Argentine Way", but when it came to this disaster, it had also "come back" and, frankly, the whole movie was a shame. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been quite desperate) the story was bad, the colors good and the film too long. He had some of the old resources in him like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try to stimulate interest but without success. The music was unfortunate, and I have to say that no melody was memorable in any way ... since I was a huge fan of Miss Grable, I wish I had never seen this one!
