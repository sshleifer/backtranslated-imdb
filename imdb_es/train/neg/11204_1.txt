:: POWERS SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was horrible. A catholic / superstitious / suspenseful thriller that revisits well the footsteps of previous films. <br /> <br /> The priest who doubts. Sex and the priesthood Politics and religion Church hypocrisy. Conspiracy that involves the church. The dawn of a new era of evil. All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and lame with a weak story to suffice. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick: the last rights a person can ask to cleanse sins while on the verge of death; And excommunication, the act of separating a person from the Church. Basically, an Excommunicated person can not receive Absolution. This is the Sin Eater, and I'll leave it like that. Add all the things I already mentioned and have "The Order". <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene with the priest entwined with shots of an image of the Virgin Mary instead of insulting Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (paraphrasing) "I am the redeemer and the sinner of sins, I live without love, blah, blah, blah", and indicated him walking in a dark alley with a long raincoat over there "The Matrix". <Br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 1 not only for being horrible and unoriginal, but also because it managed to insult a complete faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
