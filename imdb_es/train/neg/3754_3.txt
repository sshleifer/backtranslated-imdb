As a fan of all the Star Trek series, it seemed like a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" presents Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (much pain, and the death of a member of the crew) was a device to save money, like many of its "shows in the bottle" (episodes in which all the scenes take place in the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final look than this one for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, are there any other types?) They were also aborted. This was the last episode of the second season; Thus, the season ended "not with a bang" but with "a moan".
