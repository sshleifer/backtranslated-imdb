Scary Movie 3 is so stinky that it's hard to put it into words. It makes films like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material, let's say. <br /> <br /> Scary's original movie was very funny, one of the best parody movies of the 90s, coming from a great team that previously shook our world with Do not be a threat to South Central while you drink your juice in the bell. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the change of cast and crew would help, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> In 20 minutes, I smiled twice. Not a laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this time in writing, most people on this site have voted 10/10 made me feel physically sick. When there are great movies like School of Rock Out, which actually have jokes that are * panting * funny, anyone who spends their money on gut like this needs to have their heads examined. <br /> <br /> without stars / ****
