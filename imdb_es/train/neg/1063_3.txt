The idea is beautiful. Bringing so many stars in a movie is great. But ... too many stories, too short and meaningless. There is no connection between the scenes. There were between 3 and 4 brilliant stories ... but of 18. The painting reminded me of "All invisible children", a movie that I really liked. However, compared to this, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the intriguing short story, which unfolds, begins and has its ending. And it lacks the theme that connects all those - children. I do not find a topic Parisian enough to connect 18 short sketches together. Maybe for people who know Paris is interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
