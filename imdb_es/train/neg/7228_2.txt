The good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes Production of first class sets. CGI buildings and vehicles well detailed. <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> The horrible mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Faulty logic A giant pyramid appears and nobody investigates it, does anyone really question it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was expelled, nor was there any reason why I should do something as trivial as Jill's impregnated? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Horrible script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that have not been fully realized. The dialogue was almost laughable in some points. Random characters and events that are not necessary. Boring characters Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently it was only a mystery for the writer. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance, no texture. His character does not have redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not a single character in the whole movie who has any purpose, no goal (other than Horus's obvious), no motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. No bets - the key to writing the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but, great thing, he is a bad guy. One can not even decipher if Horus or Jill is the main character. That's the problem: dedicating half of the film to each character means that the writer never fully explores a character, never brings it to fruition. They are cardboard cutouts that walk and talk, and almost do nothing but explore the fine pieces. For the first time the rhythm director. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is ephemeral and, sometimes, unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> It's not worth seeing. A rudimentary story, a development of characters below normal, corny CGI does not save the good production of sets.
