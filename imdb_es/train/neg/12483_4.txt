This movie is like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is an argument somewhere below all this debauchery, but the filmmakers do not do a good job of showing it, which is a shame because it "could" be a decent story. Richard Hill offers a solid performance in the lead role, like the villain, who unfortunately did not appear in any other important thing. The fight scenes are not that bad either, I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" the blood of his victims, and there is a lot of nudity and sex to attenuate the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not good, but neither necessarily so bad ...
