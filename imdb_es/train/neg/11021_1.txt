Hallam Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and then experiences a kind of Oedipus complex. <br /> <br /> It lasts 95 minutes, but it would be better in ten. There is about an hour in the middle where he practices climbing on the roofs and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less understanding). <br /> <br /> There is a strange love story involved that does not. I have nothing to do with anything. She looks like her mother, yes, so what? We know that he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. They should have put the beginning and the end together and it would have been an O.K. short film. Now it is the portrait of a character that does not change. He is a boy who happens things. The only active option you have in the middle of the movie is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> This whole Oedipus thing is happening that is supposed to make us analyze your character. She paints her face, dresses in women's clothes and wears a dead badger on her head. A badger You have to see the end! He returns home with the badger on his head (and is filmed as a sticky Horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he had sex at first). And somehow they thought that this would not be entertaining enough, so they put indie punk music in the background. However, I must admit that I am allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex in the nose. He feels like this director of MacKenzie / boy / whatever he is trying to show us that he has also been studying psychology at school. You are very smart! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back to our memories! You really dug! What Wallraff! Well, now I realized that this movie is based on a random book, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. A lot of talking heads. In addition, the editor has changed colors from one scene to another, you know cold and warm, etc. why? Maybe "Hallam Foe" is both a feature and a proof film for people with color blindness. Or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that it feels lonely, so they increased the blue so we really understand it. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how drawings that you have made in the presentation. And all the "cute" sexual things that are happening. This whole movie is an independent cliché. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a couple of times. Although it is really annoying to be a film student and see how a shit like this happens through the machine.
