We have a lake We have an animated meteorite crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with fins. Well, then let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots named Arnie and Mitch define the definitive definition of "comic relief". We also have to have a sheriff who does not really do a damn thing in this movie and nobody listens. Shit, we've already passed half the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! Do not worry, let's introduce a guy with a mustache, ask him to steal a store to indicate he's a bad guy, to appear somewhere near the lake, to be chased through the forest and all for the sole purpose of ending it. Like dinosaur food. That should work. <br /> <br /> A complete, clumsy mess, this movie. Your logic will twist your mind to force the laughter out of you. The first film that presents Dave Allen as a "stop motion supervisor". After this, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the mid-nineties, when the band ran out of money to pay him, I suppose. The effects of the dinosaurs are lovely and the whole movie is quite funny, unintentionally. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing that can be said about it. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes. The hallucinatory logic in the narrative must be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie and Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
