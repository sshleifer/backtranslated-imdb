I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and I trust that there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1, we just do not have pockets full of theater tickets and $ 100 tickets! # 2 If I ever allow someone to use a room for a moment of "afternoon delight," I would be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very defined ethical and behavioral standards that we take seriously. # 3 As in the movie, the concept was missing in the same way: Doug simply removed his emblem of the golden key and passed it to some other employee. We earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge that can be used. they. There is a complete application and verification process to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a janitor as nothing more than a mercenary looking for money. In summary it does a bad service to our organization. I welcome any comments.
