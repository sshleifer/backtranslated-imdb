Trying to conceive something as insipid as EL SENTINEL would be quite difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and is full of holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who "took one" for Reagan during the attack on his life. Years later, we found Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly as the First Lady's guard (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete does not pass a polygraph test, he is identified as a disgruntled agent by researcher David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the presidential assassination plan unfolds, Pete finds himself fleeing from our our people. Her only confidant is the First Lady, and she does not want to tell anyone about their affections for each other (so Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If innocent, how can you help prevent the assassination attempt while running away from the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> The only big and overwhelming problem with this movie is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Is not that what the movie is supposed to be about? One could think so! But the audience is never allowed to see why the killer (s) wants to kill the Prez. Hmm Does anyone forget to put that in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> What about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It seems that she was put into the movie strictly as a piece of a $$ - candy. What was his purpose again? Did he do more than look good in tight pants and a low cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with The Sentinel's basic premise that it is ridiculous. The action is hampered by the "What is ...?" The answers will surely be spoken by those unfortunate enough to see the movie.
