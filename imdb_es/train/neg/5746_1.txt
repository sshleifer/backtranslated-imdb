About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I saw this on the used shelf, so I thought, why not? Oh, my God, a pity for the zombie movies and the fans of the genre! Whoever made this movie must save the camcorder and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their movies and have something that this movie does not have dignity. I know what it takes to make movies and I'm sure a lot of money and time was spent on making Meat Market, but none of that money and time went into making it good. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I do not know how you got the release of a DVD, but whoever did it is a good friend or is banging his head against the wall. Gore films is quality not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I could not get my money back. Please, if you have seen this movie, write here and end with the block. I know I'm being very tough, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the point.
