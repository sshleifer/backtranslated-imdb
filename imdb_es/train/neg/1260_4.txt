Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname with which Tom Drake played the romantic protagonist of Donna Reeds! So let's make this clear immediately. From her first role as an engineer in THE GET-AWAY (1941) as well as her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Mrs. Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY. She is not attractive and thin actress. Whose papers in M.G.M. He rarely lived up to his talents. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Reed has the support of a cast of actors of competent characters, who, unfortunately, must go through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy. Clearly M.G.M. I was out of his depth doing this kind of movie. A better type produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the 'touch' of Ernst Lubitsch nor the ingenuity of Preston Sturges could save this film. A fairly conventional romantic comedy that had all the marks of a pre-war effort (WWII). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg were still alive, the game screen would have gone through a significant rewrite or he would never have seen it. daylight It did not fit Louis B. Mayer's "safe zone" of any challenging family entertainment. A form that could not cope with the post-war challenges of the 'DeHavilland decision', the loss of its theater chains, television and would contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are ahead of her culmination in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
