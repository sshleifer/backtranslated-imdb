A vampire's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar prostitute in this very low-budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I will attribute it to a massive hallucination, but it is still disconcerting. The only redemption factor (and this is me being extremely generous here) could be the grandfather, who is the only semi-nice character in this whole mess. Do not waste your money, or time. In fact, here's a tip: if Troma puts it on DVD, but DOES NOT do it themselves, it's very likely to be bullshit. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Comment with Omar and Kirk; second commentary with scenes removed from the cast and crew; interactivity bloopers troma; radiation march Clip of "Terror Firmer"; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for "The Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My rating: D
