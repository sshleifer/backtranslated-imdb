After finally seeing this movie in its entirety, I am completely taken aback by the adoration it has received from both critics and online users. Is it the worst western of all time? No, I would not say that. But "the last great Western of the United States", a phrase that I saw that was applied more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A movie that tries to tell a story like this one needs credible characters to speak in a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is one of the most trite and cliche I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in moans per minute; As in, how many times an actor or actress is forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There are so many examples of this that it distracts. The cheese lines come to you in waves; Predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /> <br /> If a bad dialogue does not bother you, then what about bad shootings? Few Westerners can show you a weapon fight that is completely incredible as you desperately try to get them to take the action seriously. It's fine if there's a comedic advantage in such shootings, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very rigid choreography and staging of the first weapon games is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns. The final showdown redeems the director a bit in this score, but by then, he was so disinterested in the movie that he was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Apart from those faults, I can say that the images are impressive: the film is well filmed and all the settings look very good. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given work for. However, if you are looking for the last great Western American, do yourself a favor: rent without forgiveness instead. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
