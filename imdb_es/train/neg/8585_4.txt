Well, I guess I'll have to say "The emperor has no clothes." When I saw this program on the PBS list last night, I had hope and apprehension. I loved "Morse" (even getting to buy the complete DVD set) and I felt that, although I always liked Kevin Whately's sergeant. Character of Lewis, the show was John Thaw, period! After seeing the new "Inspector Lewis" (as indicated here), I am more convinced than ever that I was right ... What is right (although it looks horrible (both are very old and very fat ), but he just does not have the charisma to take the show as Thaw did. <br /> <br /> And as for his "partner" Fox, well ... maybe critics here in England can understand what He's saying, but I could hardly do it for one. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that they should have done it, left "Morse" to rest in peace.
