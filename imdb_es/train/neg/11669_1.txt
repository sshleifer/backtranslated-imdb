I guess it's nice and modern to see wonderful things in the absolute vacuum of a movie like this. With the sometimes useless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene without explosions, coarse and corny language in a single line. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when used properly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take the long scenes without dialogues or scandalous landscapes. I am sure that they must have great meaning and understanding, because the implicit message is wrapped in bewilderment. The performance is poor ... soft and pedestrian ... and presents one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit to the end). The landscape is monotonous, and the ridiculously long sequence of completion of the girl who walks through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled out. I would call this anti-climactic, but since the film did not adapt to any kind of climax at all ... even in the "erotic" scenes ... it would be false. I'm sure there was a script used during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie does not offer anything that interests or surprises you ... no great story, no surprising vision, no visual drama, no emotion. Apart from two or three funny moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and monotonous movie.
