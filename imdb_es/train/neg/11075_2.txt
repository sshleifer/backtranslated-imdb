Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy", which deals with a man who discovers a race of adorable and small fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors begin looting his grave before his body cools. This is the book where the Ewoks came up with the idea of. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a flagrant flagrancy of "Little Fuzzy". I wonder why I am the only one who has noticed. <br /> <br /> But do not take my word for it. Here is a link to the Guntenberg Project where you can download a free copy of "Little Fuzzy": http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
