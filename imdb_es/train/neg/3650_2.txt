No laughs at all. Yes, I watched all this train collision, but only to not ask myself later if Cleese had come to his senses in the last part. (No, he had not). <br /> <br /> This may be historically interesting for the young people out there, seeing that British "humor" included black "jokes" like these, thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What surprises me even more, however, is reading the comments of the other reviewers, who recognize that this is not very good, but then turn around and give it a high vote. If the vast majority of the comedies you've seen are even much worse than this, then I certainly regret your torturing existence. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this show seems to be aimed at young children, but the theme is not. So, who is this for? People who enjoy repeated and prolonged double shots, gossip, jokes about drugs (interesting only as a short trip to '77), and another "low" mood. The Three Stooges are still fun, and so were they for me when I was a kid. They made a great effort to make the jokes work. However, this has been removed from schlock. I am afraid that IS the end of civilization, if this really is accepted as something worthwhile. Next, you will tell me that sensationalist television is popular. :(
