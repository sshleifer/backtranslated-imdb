"American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIMES. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely similar to the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It is hosted by a boy with a beard. That is the most exciting aspect of your program. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... oh, wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the gang of single-line jets that everyone takes Come back revealing their biggest fears to the DJ bearded. Without knowing it, a crazed nurse / serial killer listens ... <br /> <br /> The crazy nurse proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, excuse me again ... making your fears come alive . These fears include stunners such as "voodoo" and the fact that old women with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in a word, rotten. The wave of murders of Crazy Nurse lacks motivation, there is nothing that makes the spectator "jump", that ends, and again, voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have no respect for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you take care of your loved ones, even a little, go to your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
