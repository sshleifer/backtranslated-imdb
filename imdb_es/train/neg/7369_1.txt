I had the feeling that after "Submerged", this would not be better ... He was right. He must be looking for money for champagne, and he does not care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly doubled by a stranger who does not look anything like him; The edition is, well, just one grade above the fans. It's just a grade B or C movie with just enough money to hire a pair of talented videographers and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in the publication -production (... voice dubbing, etc.). Pity, because the plot is really good for an SG movie. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie, unless you send me an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
