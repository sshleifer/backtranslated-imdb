I do not understand this The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has a good rhythm, a good edition and a good address too. So, WHY, OH, WHY they did not hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so that it was not so corny and WHY, OH WHY they hired such bad actors that they can not get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. Most of the time it looks good and feels good, but in the end, you realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's a good production but a bad movie. Very bad really. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come one, seriously!
