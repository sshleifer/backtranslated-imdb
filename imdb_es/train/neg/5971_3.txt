A friend told me to watch this movie and commented on what a beautiful story this was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back, since I could have done MANY things more productive with my time ... like, for example, mixing my thumbs. I do not see anything that redeems this movie at all, except for what it looks like ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and that's being generous)
