Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of 1930s gangster movies made in the Warner brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton plays a middle-aged gangster who looks back to his hard-hitting life when he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has ongoing health problems, so Keaton falls into the early age crime through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays the lord of Boyle's rival crime and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious twist as Danny Vermin, yes, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is the younger brother of Keaton who became the district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays the moll of Keaton. The film seems notoriously cheap, so it looks like a television program instead of a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogs and gags, the film is maintained during the first half, but then quickly loses steam and descends to mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the landscape making his best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only unpleasant, not funny. Piscopo does the "once" bit once too much. Several supporting actors try to hold the fort as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a table sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning woman. The second half evolves into a successful or lost television program type tone and never recovers. The final scene used by The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is the movie The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable, seen in a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience would no doubt be aware of the actual release date of The Roaring Twenties in 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
