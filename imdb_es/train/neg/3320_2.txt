Honestly, I had high expectations when I started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring movies I've seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow. , so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short). I am sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she did it in several pages, filled it with a description and did not intend for people to read it. One day, or could drag and lose its appeal, what "Emma" certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this slow-paced failure, but at least it had animated lines to compensate for it, as well as some good performances. <br /> <br /> That brings me to failure # 2, which is, of course, acting. Although I do not care about someone who is involved in this movie, I'm sure they are capable of doing a good job, but I did not see much of that in this movie. It was as if people tried too hard to be clever, too difficult to be "high class", too difficult to be British (well, some of them), so they all came out as a group of actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, seemed just like actors, and not really like the people they played. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people they were playing with really were not that nice. Why did everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Of course, she was kind to the rich and beautiful people who were in front of them, but it was terrible gossip behind her back. If her friends were "ugly", then she did not even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so big? Why do people have to tell stories "to make her laugh?" Of course the snob could not do that well. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not change my opinion exactly. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not care about this one. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are not made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
