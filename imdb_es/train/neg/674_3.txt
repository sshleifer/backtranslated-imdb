It is known that I fell asleep during the movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things that include: being very tired, being warm and comfortable in the environment and having eaten a lot. However, this time I fell asleep because the movie was trash. The development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but without an explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit that I may have missed a part of the movie, but I saw most of the movie and everything seemed to happen on its own without any real concern for anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
