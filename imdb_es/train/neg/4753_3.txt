The Director F.W. Murnau remained wisely in the silent film medium that he knew so well to cover this story of the lives of the native islanders in the southern seas. The documentary style works very well in the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful, and the activities of the daily life of the islanders are interesting to observe. However, the film loses momentum when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two condemned lovers. History never becomes so interesting, despite being handled well by Murnau. He won an Academy Award for best cinematography, although the award should probably have been for the best scenario. You can not really credit the PD for shooting in such a beautiful place.
