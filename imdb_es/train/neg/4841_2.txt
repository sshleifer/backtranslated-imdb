REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I am really surprised to see the enthusiastic reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It is a great pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would have laughed loudly, and a lot, but I was on a date with a former soldier. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think that at my appointment, a flat line "good boy", he liked it. That is not a compliment. I know that an actor wants to work ... Good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful mockery of Ralph. I voted 2 only because Ralph looked so awesome. But I must beg, Ralph, how could you? And because?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to see The End of The Affair to heal and recover now ... C1
