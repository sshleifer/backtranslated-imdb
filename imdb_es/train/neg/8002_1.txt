What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating for this. Do not be fooled by the positive comments; It was not scary. It was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even attract your attention. I just lost 2 hours of my life watching this crap-fest. The computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first two times. After about 15 minutes he no longer entertained. The dialogue was terrible, it must be a translation thing. Another negative that stood out was that of the idiot Americans. 3 were portrayed and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a couple of lines to fill in this, since we have to have 10. The employees of the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter.
