I think if you like the sixties, like me, you're bound to lose about 80 minutes of your life watching this train that you can barely see. The saving graces of this rarity include a surprisingly accurate social commentary on the values ​​of the sixties along with a number of relatively well-known actors who have been caught in the early (and shameful) images. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sit down and decide to write a long-running film, covering all the high points (and more) of the problems between the flower children and the establishment, and then put it in the hands of a pair of the hippies and gave them a budget of approximately $ 10,000 to complete it. It is not a classic, but in its way captures the truly strange that was the time, stupidity, excess of idealism and the rigidity of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.
