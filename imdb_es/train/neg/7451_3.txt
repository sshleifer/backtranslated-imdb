I'm sorry, it's not good. <br /> <br /> It starts interesting, but you lose a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the great actors normally (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) offers a really good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be due to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (in German), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover really is not a credible villain. In addition, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story at all (except to save the life of a main character at any given time, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-) <br /> <br /> Talking about unnecessary scenes: the main complaint is really the plot and the clich√©: the detective (of course!) has to resolve a personal matter with the villain and (of course!) is suspended from his official duties courtesy of His personal entanglement. The killer (of course!) * Wants * to be tracked and plays a game of cat and mouse with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many films are based on a similar plot, most of them better, however. <br /> <br /> The plot has holes in abundance and many completely incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute or work well with the story at all (for example, the scene of the truck stop or the car on the edge of the cliff, etc.). <br /> <br /> To top it all, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these aspects. We have seen * many * better endings with a similar type of battle configuration-in-a-one-in-one-in-a-sad-winter ... In the end there is a supposedly moving reunion of parents and children. .. Hokey, at least.
