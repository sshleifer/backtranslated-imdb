... Am I missing something ??? "unexpected developments of the plot"? "Plot twisting with subversive rejoicing"? these spectators are seeing the same Arquette vehicle that I have submitted to (in an episode of sub-unconscious and now obvious sadomasochism) ... I joined this site simply to make sure no one else rents this stench. ... this film was a shame for all the people involved ... quick question: Did Sir Stevie read the script before giving Kate C. OK? If so, then it must be the same Spielberg who gave the green light to "Howard the duck" ... do not give me that, "it was a successful play" Shit, I suppose Mssr. Reddin is not very happy ... the cover of the DVD promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story ..." History !! It's a shit like this that makes old Bobby McKee and his erratic band of structuralists sound like geniuses ... Sundance? Berlin? Toronto? I have a homemade video of my cat with farts that evokes more interest than Arquette's negative dimension portrait of the loss of anguish ... and, to speak of deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T .; Thank God, just at the moment when I thought Dave would call the police! and thanks to Shiva that the cops finished catching the real murderer ... ¡¡!!! Until the credits, I was still waiting for it to be a kind of grift against Arquette and her "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, she does not escape unharmed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with the "athlete's foot in my crotch "gag ??? Are you worse in this or "just cause"? I do not know ... hey movie lovers: why do not they make a successful night and rent this together with "jersey girl" and "white chick" and then they commit sepukka (or it's seppuka) ... and they take E. ? Dunsky with you ...
