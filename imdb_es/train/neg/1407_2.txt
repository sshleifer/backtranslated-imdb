After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of stupid pranks without history. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic slapstick here. It seems that Kusturica has gone downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I really liked his first films, and that's why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. Hopefully your next one is great.
