I only rented this movie because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that seeing the name of RR on the cover (as an actor) this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would have made, so if He lends him his name, then it has to be good, right? BAD BAD BAD BAD By far, the worst edition since "Manos manos del destino". The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and, after the first 30 minutes, you will not want to try to follow it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they owed someone, but they are very good at this. Also, they were only in this movie for a couple of minutes each and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to see a movie with poor editing, poor performance and a confusing plot, I know who my guest is, but do not say that they did not tell you.
