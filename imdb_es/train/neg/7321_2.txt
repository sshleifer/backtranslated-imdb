Maybe it's not my genre, but the plot was horrible as were the performances of Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of being seduced here (while taking marijuana, why was it necessary to include this? This plot weakened considerably). Also the character of Farentino. It would have been better if she had had more respect for a relationship. Would you try to say the movie? not much.
