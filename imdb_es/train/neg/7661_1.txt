The worst movie title of all time is one that is delivered quickly and frequently. Most of the time it is an exaggeration of the fact, but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of actual candidates: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Battlefield Earth and Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> As I watched the 90-minute hole, it was difficult for me to even stay awake even when I was trying to laugh at the movie. But unfortunately I felt alone in the dark (I was going to try to avoid the pun, but I could not resist) while I looked around expecting to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Unfortunately, my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and the effects, since that should be the only positive part of the movie. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they are even called Xenos) and the creatures in Pitch Black. They can become invisible at random (and I assure you that they are random) and be damaged by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something similar to a zombie. All these are shown with obsolete special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People who shoot randomly in a blue screen scenario or in an empty set of monsters that were inserted in the publication. The light flickers quickly on a dark screen, which causes your students to burn out from overwork, while loud rock music resonates in the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the highlights. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of ​​looking hard is to wear a black shirt with a raincoat and not shave for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is quite inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines involve a barking order. The three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they have done a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be movie lovers, I suppose. The film contains the most uncomfortable love scene I've seen in the movie between the two. <br /> <br /> Then the plot comes. Quite frankly, the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is, at best, illogical. The holes in the plot could contain the collective egos of the three stars. The film begins with a text and a voice that explains the background story. This opening lasts more than a minute and the viewer already knows that he is expecting something terrible. This opening narration is then repeated adnausem in the uncomfortable dialogue in a very clumsy and hard way throughout the rest of the film. And the end did not make an ounce of meaning. Not only did it make no sense in the world of the movie, it simply did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the address of one Uwe Boll. Unfortunately, that is all that can be said. Its use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. Your lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes where she is not the focus of the shot. The complete loss of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally, I opted to use voice-over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show in a second theater. And while the laughter that I and my friends gave me made it worth every quarter, I would advise people not to pay more for this movie. Take about 3 friends and divide the rent cost and tear this movie for a new one. <br /> <br /> What a shame, Uwe Boll. The fault is yours Reid. It's your fault, Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone who was associated with this movie.
