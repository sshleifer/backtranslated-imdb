This, and the immoral tales, left a bad taste in the mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it's not very well done, part of the acting is really bad epic (like the "American" woman with a French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop of being anxious about the marriage to be interested (when it seems that it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden understanding of the young man's secret makes no sense, "is not explained at all. I also did not like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality, the central idea, the idea that this "sexy beast" exists, if you want, that she lives in the forest, it could have been the basis of a perverse but amusing story, but instead, it is only used as a basis for an unpleasant sex.Negative, game of morality.
