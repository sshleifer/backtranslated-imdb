Marlon Brando had lost a lot of interest in acting when he made this movie. His performance as "The Swede" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be. He does not overact. Instead, he simply acts in a strange way and mocks his shameful gigantic circumference. The scene in which Brando climbs the bathroom is probably the worst and funniest moment in the history of cinema. When we see him fall headlong into a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are seeing the same actor who starred in Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was I fed up with the movie business? Did you like to make a complete and absolute fool of yourself? I guess we'll never know. But this movie serves as a fascinating study of what bad acting is all about. <br /> <br /> On that note, watch veteran actor Donald Sutherland as he struggles to pronounce his lines, ashamed of himself for agreeing to participate. in this farce.
