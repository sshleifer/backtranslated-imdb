This movie is possibly one of the most horrible horror movies I've seen. The length was not long enough to include a good story. Also, the way the foster parents died was simply ridiculous. Does the mother die suddenly from falling in a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a policeman? I can see where some originality might have been what they were looking for, but it could have been better. Also, the taste of all that made me want to push to stop it before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and discovering that she was 'Lucifer', I wanted to throw up. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It is the name of a man. It should be given to a male character. All in all, the movie was boring and could have used a better plot.
