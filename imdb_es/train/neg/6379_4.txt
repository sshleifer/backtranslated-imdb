With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space", how could it go wrong? Just add some of the best stereotypes for the characters, use Village People as the main providers of the soundtrack and add tons of gay gags. The plot is not important. Pity, this movie does not contain any of this and every joke loses the point. All the characters resemble the rest of German gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more about the movie. Apparently, my expectation was high.
