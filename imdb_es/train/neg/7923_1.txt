I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason why, but this is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this piece of worthless garbage. This film should serve as a lesson for all filmmakers of the past, present and future ... when you have a film as successful as the original "Corps Grinder", you should probably leave the lie to the sleeping dogs and definitely should not try to revitalize it . more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial backing to get a superior sequel like the one Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do it, you should probably spend a little more money what I earned in the original and for the love of God ... I NEVER recorded a film in a video ... why the filmmakers try to do this when everyone knows that the quality is going to be frightening ... I personally have no However, to see a movie made in this way, it's even worth the dust to blow it to hell ... if you can not afford to make a sequel that is better than your original movie, then sell the rights to the movie to someone who can . ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking (or smoking) when he wrote this god-a wful script? I mean, come on, "extraterrestrial" dogs and cats from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of crushing human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their horrible performances, they are overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and look at the original instead.
