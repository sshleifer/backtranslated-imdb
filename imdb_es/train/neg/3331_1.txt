Dreck about three beautiful women in California who are going to cover some festival (or something like that). All the hotels are reserved, so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house. What they do not know is that there is a spooky dweller who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawning. Bored, meaningless, absolutely stupid "horror" movie. Bach and his two friends are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is boring. Bach and her friends are not actresses, their faces are blank at all times. The final "revelation" is laughably predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested in the way. There is a bit of free female nudity expected, but that is not enough to save this. Bored, meaningless and unknown (for a good reason). A 1 all the way.
