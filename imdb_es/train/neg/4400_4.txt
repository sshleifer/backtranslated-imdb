One of Frances Farmer's first films; At 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a great voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great at the time, is really corny. Roy Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion, it's only worth seeing if you're a fan of Frances Farmer, and possibly a Bing Crosby fan.
