The plot is simple: an old man who lives on a main street in a forest, one day, witnesses how a man murders a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the elder guides the police to where the murder occurs, no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a tiny dialogue that reflects most of the scenes in the film, an old man who lives alone in a house. During the film I discovered that I was scared twice, namely when the murdered child appears abruptly before the old man. The rest of the movie that I have to admit did not interest me; I found the rhythm of the movie a bit slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too much time. I feel that more could have been done about the relationship, the ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. Only in the forest at night, without being sure of your own mind, can lead to strange situations, children always scare like ghosts, see Dark Water.
