Would anyone really see this RUBBISH if it did not contain little children running naked? From a cinematic point of view, it's probably one of the worst movies I've found absolutely terrible. Some pervert woke up one day and thought he was going to make a movie with little girls and call it art, he would hit them in the field and there is no need to tell a story or an explanation of how they got there or why they do not show up. live anywhere or have parents because movies do not need any of that. I would like to comment on the rest of the movie, but I have not marked the spoilers, so I just say "avoid", "avoid" and find a suitable movie to watch.
