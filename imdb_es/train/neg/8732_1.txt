The plot is about the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the movie, it seems that he has some problems with his daughter. In the end the serial killer is trapped. That's. But before you discover who dunnit, you have to see a terrible performance of all the actors. It's amazing how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could continue like this, but that's a waste of my time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you
