Steve Martin should stop trying to make classic comedy remakes. He absolutely does not fit in this part. Like the pitiful remake of the Out Of Towners, this film falls flat on its face. The way someone once thought that Steve Martin could even approach the wonderful performance of Jack Lemmon surpasses me, and the same is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played Bilko's part better. Martin is great when he makes his own original characters, but fails to try to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is in the first line of credits when the movie ends. The line "The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation from the United States Army" was almost the only line that really made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, acquire the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. Those are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this error that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the mentioned Lemmon classic and the new version of Psycho. None of them should have ever happened.
