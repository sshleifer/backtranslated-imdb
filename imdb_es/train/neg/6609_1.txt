I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made, because I have not seen all the Bollywood movies, but my imagination tells me that it could very well be. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like an artistic attempt. suicide on behalf of the director, and for my part I think he has succeeded in his mission. No actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as he did for all the humiliation that this film should carry. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director, here's the director of photography, who seems to be rehearsing for the amateur filmmaker of the year award. There is a dramatic score that hopes to take you to the next scene. The man of enlightenment, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb in the pole in the other, and waiting for the flame that burns the cigarette to add to the light so necessary in each scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise everyone could be forgiven here. The set of actors in Aag came together to promote a new beginning and dimension for the new version of India's most beloved film of all time, 'Sholay'. One should not forget that these actors were not forced to participate in this film, they are a list A and are willing to participate in something that, let's face it, would surely have had a great public expectation. For what the question raises, apart from Amitabh (for now), did the other actors really believe that their performances tried to improve the original? Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember their dialogue in this abominable farce of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course not, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money you can talk about. <br /> <br /> I really hope that everyone involved is satisfied with what is really a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only manages to contaminate everyone's mind when they see the original.
