This is another bad movie that you should probably avoid seeing. The plot could be much "thicker" than it really is and it would be better to make it a very successful movie. <br /> <br /> The acting leaves a lot to be desired, although you can not locate your finger on what. It's. <br /> <br /> This is one of the ones you see on late-night television, maybe in the US. UU., Simply because you can not sleep. Look at it if you want but do not expect too much from it.
