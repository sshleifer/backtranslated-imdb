It seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only saw it in the first place because they filmed it near where they live. How about that for an endorsement? If this movie were filmed near where I lived, I would not mention it in my review. It is awful! Several reviews claim that this movie is a fake or ironic horror movie, it is neither. It is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy, since it is not only a bad attempt of a horror movie, but also as a comedy. However, I laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This film has two good things in its favor, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately, it would have been more interesting to see an hour and half of the mask and the weapon rest on a table and then watch this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also ridiculous, youthful and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, you have already lost time reading this review, do not waste any more time in this movie. Arrggghhh! It is exasperating that films like this are even made. He hoped that the entire cast would be credited with a team to Alan Smithee, a name that is used when a person, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a film because it is very bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing redeeming in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on the rent and I feel like I got ripped off. Avoid. 1 out of 10
