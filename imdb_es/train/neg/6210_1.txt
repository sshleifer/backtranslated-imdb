This is the worst movie I've seen since "I Know Who Killed Me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, I can assure you that only frustration and disappointment await you if you decide to go see this. Hey, Tim Burton, he used to be a big fan of yours ... did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, what's the% f # k? <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, here is the story in a few words ... Nine wakes up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh, wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie ... it rains. I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.
