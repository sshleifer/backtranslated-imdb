Possibly not, but it is horrible. Even the fantastic cast can not save it. Well, I admit it started pretty fun, but it seemed to plummet as soon as they jumped those girls at the generals' house. Bill Murray stopped being an ingenious and witty guy and turned into an asshole who shouted things to people in the street who were not funny, it's like he's trying to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? Come on ...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers, to laugh. A good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army. UU And it shows how arrogant and imbecile they really are, albeit unintentionally. In fact, I felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda garbage could really be released.
