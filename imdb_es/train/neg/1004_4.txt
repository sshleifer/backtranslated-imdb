Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (like Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is surprised when a court accused whispers "Thank you" to the testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) when he leaves the witness stand. In the initial sequences of this movie, you are given the explanation. You will see that Mr. Cool J's diabolical detective partner, Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decides NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The policemen in the city of "Edison" are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and snort their drugs. Whether to impress his girlfriend (here, called "Pussy") or to win a Pulitzer, the corruption of the city does not sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches both unexpected reach and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film out of the water, but barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the draw for "star of pop movie star" (also known as the progression of the "rapper to the actor"). Mr. McDermott has fun with his paper. Lending gravitas to the proceedings are wisely supporting the actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems to be lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
