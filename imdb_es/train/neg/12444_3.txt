Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in costumes of space girls. <br /> <br /> I love 50 science fiction movies, I even love 50s movies with cheesy, but this movie is really bad. And not in a MST3K way. <br /> <br /> Practically can not be seen, since a pair of bozos make their best impression of "hip cat" by Abott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Cheesecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, as in "Cat Women On The Moon" but it can not in this case. This movie requires a mute button and a fast forward feature. <br /> <br /> That said, I could see Gloria and Dolores walk around the spacecraft for about an hour or so.
