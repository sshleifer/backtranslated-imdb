While "Santa Claus conquers Martians" is generally cited as one of the worst movies ever made, this 1959 Mexican film is so bad that it makes "SCCM" look like "It's a Wonderful Life." You have to ask yourself what the people who made this movie thought; perhaps they considered it an allegory of the third world about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah . They just were not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable signs of pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the inspiration for "Autopista".) Back to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous Earth orbit ("MST3K" tones); instead of the elves, their toys are made by chosen children from all over the world; and had a sophisticated espionage team to check which children are naughty and nice. The result is like a sweat shop in Orwellian outer space. It's enough to turn off Christmas forever. This and other low-income Mexican children's movies were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; It is not surprising that the sixties became such a turbulent period in the history of the United States. The baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" movies as children would be eager to become revolutionaries.
