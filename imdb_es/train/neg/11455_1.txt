First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste for movies ... <br /> <br /> Comedies of 2007 that I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory <br /> <br /> 2007 comedies I hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off "Hot Rod" after reaching the 20 minute mark. At that moment I knew that this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal, I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 in IMDb. Anyone over 10 who has enjoyed this must have some kind of mental deficiency. <br /> <br /> This does not compare to Will Farrell and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not upload anything other than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they made Ian McShane and Isla Fisher make this movie ... they must have owed him favors or something. I entered knowing that it would be a silly movie, but I thought that at least it would be funny. Not only smiled. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not comment on the films in IMDb, but it was so horrible that I had to warn people. This is just the 4th movie I've seen that I felt compelled to qualify 1/10.
