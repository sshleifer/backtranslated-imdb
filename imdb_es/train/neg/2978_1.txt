I'm a big fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are my favorite in particular. That said, Zombie 3 is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Needless to say, I enjoyed it a lot, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities with "The Return of the Living Dead" by Dan O'Bannon, but while the movie was intentionally funny, this is the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous performances I have witnessed, especially the main scientific character. His scenes with the general were simply hysterical. In addition, the effects are unsatisfactory and, in many cases, neglected, and the scenes of death are often simply stupid. This, of course, makes it even more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene in which the boy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens his eyes and somehow DOES OUT OF THE BORDER (obviously taken out with a bit of rope) , stuck to the guys Cuello, killing him. Do the zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies all the laws of physics known to man, and is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. That is just one of the many really ridiculous moments in the idiotic mess. I can not believe I got such a high rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this fool.
