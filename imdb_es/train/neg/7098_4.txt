An interesting idea for a movie, both show the last dragon on earth and show the fight that he and someone evil have together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. Now grown Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for "killing" the dragons. But since Einon has half of Draco's ear, they both feel that the pain in one of them is hurt or dead. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for the Oscar for the best visual effects. Worth seeing!
