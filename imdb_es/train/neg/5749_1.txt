This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies that have been made. Each scene is painful. You will complain about the fragile attempts at humor, the uncomfortable work of the camera, sexism and racism, the ridiculous plot, the wooden performance. Poor Joan Bennett; She is the only one in the movie that is not a shame. In everything, terrible.
