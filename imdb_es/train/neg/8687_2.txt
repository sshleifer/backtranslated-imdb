When anti-bush jokes are really easy to make, it is better that a show like this ensures that you have something extra. When that extra something is childish versions of political figures who make jokes about the future that they do not yet have, it's just nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are fine, but Dick Cheney mostly murmurs. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who is in love with Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld, who really does not look anything like Donald Rumsfeld. The democratic characters rarely give their names, so it is a mystery who can be who, apart from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes have coherent stories, but that is not enough to prevent this from sinking.
