We've all been asking ourselves "why do not they redo the slasher movies that were just good instead of redoing the ones that were already great, that way they can only do better?" Well, with Prom Night, they have remade the Jamie Lee Curtis movie of the 80s, although of poor quality. It is a slasher film of painting by numbers that is clearly trying to attract young teenagers (therefore, nonviolence, etc.), the knife in this slasher movie is compelling. The director spends a lot of time concentrating on trying to make the rather attractive killer look a bit creepy that everything else comes out the window. The cast that includes Britney Snow (who was excellent at Hairspray) does her best, but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared. More annoying is how the scenes of death are handled (we will hear the attack but I will not see it). It also seems that the only place where the knife worked in this movie was in the editing room, since it seems that it has been massacred (I suppose something remotely frightening ended up on the floor of the cutting room so as not to scare the children). Pour money from the Americans who send this movie to number 1 at the box office! The Slasher movies are very funny, but in the case of Prom Nights I wanted to download the original. I've seen more terrifying episodes of OC and Dawsons Creek
