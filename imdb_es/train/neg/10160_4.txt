A typical Lanza movie that had limited appeal to the audience with a weak storyline that was organized simply to justify the MGM contract of Lanza at that time. <br /> <br /> As reported by member Lastliberal (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her out of the camera (and sometimes her). In addition, his mannerism and the continuous smell of alcohol on his face during the scenes they did together were intolerable. After making his second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans," the normally quiet Grayson burst into Louie B. Mayer's office and told her without words that she would not work with Lanza again. period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's claim got stuck. Grayson starred in a series of widely received (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when asked to compare Lanza and Keel, their response was that there was no comparison between them, and that it was great to work with Keel and had much more appeal to the "real people" in the audience.
