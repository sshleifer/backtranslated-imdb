1993 was the year. This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas had won an Oscar. Who knew it would be an extra in a movie with him? They actually paid me an extra on "My Boyfriend's Back," which was filmed in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers changed their minds!) I was in the theater scene. I hurried to see the movie the day it was released in theaters. It's more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to take a look. Nothing that is even close to the quality of "Dawn of the Dead" or "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. bye
