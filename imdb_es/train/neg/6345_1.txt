this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a movie of 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> his characters are just a set of characters with tragic or comic clich√© attributes, whose sum total is a neurotic dialogue like Only Woody Allen could write. The woman loves this because it's like looking in the mirror to enjoy this movie probably <br /> <br /> this film I did not enjoy it, however, because there was no car chase and the movie did not have fights either. There were also no drug lords or gang members. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie did not have snakes. It's not my cup of tea and maybe not yours, so think about what I said before you find yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you look like a woman who has weight problems. and ally McBeal then this is meaningful to you.
