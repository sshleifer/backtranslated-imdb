The saddest part of this is the fact that it's 87 minutes that I'll never go back. I knew this was terrible from the start, with the guy dressed like a crazy Indian boss on the roof. (See if they could get away with it in 2008). My 10 year old son is really interested in baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. Even though I seemed to enjoy parts of that, I had to cringe when I heard all the unnecessary dirty language. Bad, bad movie. This was a horrible scam of bears for bad news. Completely cheeky and completely predictable. I do not mind a predictable movie if it is well made, but this was not any.
