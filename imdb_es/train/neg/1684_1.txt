Such is the case of "The Grudge", Columbia Pictures. This cinematic atrocity began when a well-intentioned American saw a Japanese made for the television movie 'Ju-on' and was inspired to remake the film in English. This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions that circumnavigated the world until it reached land in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, and I use the word freely, involves a house in Tokyo pursued by a The skinny ghost of Momma, who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghostly companion, a chubby, evil and wicked second-grade student. Is there anything more terrifying than an 8-year-old Japanese boy? Of course there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this capricious group we must add a mysterious black cat that I have affectionately called Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you may have guessed, they were killed in this fatality home and now they want to kill everyone who enters the facility. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies of rage, his ghost seeks revenge on all those who tread the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently with the acclaimed actor Bill Pullman jumping to his death from a balcony. I guess Bill Pullman got this job because his children begged him to travel to Tokyo, Disneyland. Next, we support the slightly interesting saga of nurse Yoko, 'oh no, do not go' screams at the audience, but unfortunately she does not pay attention to the terrible warnings and is predictably off like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the movie, we finally see her American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar could be a competent actress, but I could not help thinking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much that it distracted me. It's the equivalent of having Jennifer Anniston in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. No matter how hard you try, you can not stop thinking about the other project that made it famous. But I'm digressing, Karen, the nurse is hired as a substitute for the original caregiver who disappeared in our presence. <br /> <br /> She sniffs, meets the ghosts, the coma lady dies and other things happen. Looking at the blond bitch for clues, I almost expected her to find the ghost and take off her mask to reveal that it was actually old Gower, owner of the abandoned amusement park. 'I would have gotten away with it if it were not for you, the meddlesome children and that dog of yours!' <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who is competing to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions related to sound. First, choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is an excellent device to eliminate any suspense because the audience receives a warning of two minutes to prepare for another miserable and predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a strange guttural noise that sounds like a gargling Gopher. After the movie, I heard several people leave the theater making the sound and laughing. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the only survivor. And, of course, we learned that the fire that set fire to the house was extinguished in time for the next mandatory chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology. 'The Grudge' could easily be reissued in a comedy, maybe then it will be appreciated for its camp value. When deciphered, this will become the best film thriller since 'Godzilla vs. Megalon '. I would suggest waiting until the movie arrives at your local discount theater, where you can receive the public ridicule it so deserves.
