This sad little movie has little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a 'nostalgic' success. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book widely. I have the feeling that this screenwriter also changed the original version of 1925. I played the innocent Jimmy Philanderer on stage in 1974, and I thought that this $ 1 DVD would bring me back memories. No way. Even the anticipatory delight of seeing "Topper" Roland Young playing the role of "me" was a big disappointment. Three songs of the play remain, and they are done very badly. Even the classic duo, "Tea For Two", becomes a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco are not at all proud, and the star, Anna Neagle, is only ashamed. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know that the movie should be bad. Another commentator mentioned the version of Doris Day, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and tries to do the play (the original, of course), so those who are looking for the real "No No Nanette" can find a more recognizable version. there.
