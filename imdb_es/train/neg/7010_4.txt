I know nobody cares, but I do. This movie is historical for a reason. It is the unity of two heroes of two great science fiction films of the seventies. Well, one is great, and one is pretty bad. The great one is truly great, in fact he is the best. The bad is really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, in a big way I mean "Star Wars" and its star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this movie about a boy whose Vette is stolen and then goes to Las Vegas (with advantage ) and After a lot of adventures, it eventually recovers. (Since he likes to fix cars, I think you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). On the way, he meets a prostitute with a heart of gold, and ends up confronting a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 1970s science fiction movie "Laserblast," which is, as I suggested earlier. , the worst science fiction movie ever made. Milford plays the main character from whom Hamill must steal his car. I realize that nobody cares about this meeting of two great science fiction heroes, but I do. And I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. The performance of Mark Hamill needs strength, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the prostitute played by Annie Potts could be the most annoying character of all time, in any movie I've seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or on a weekday night, late at night, very late. It is one of those movies that meanders, looks for something but without finding it and yet, at the same time, its purpose is, like free form jazz, to simply exist as it is. And he does it And what it is, it's not so good, but you can not say it's not entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel cheated, but you will not feel cheated. So turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this confusing jewel without any expectation, and may the force be with you, always.
