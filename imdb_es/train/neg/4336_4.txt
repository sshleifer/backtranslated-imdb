I saw this movie and the original form of Carlitos back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people are going to say that the prequel was made with a small budget, but that it never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought it was a prequel to set the other movie, starring key characters and perhaps completing a little about the life we ​​did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has the name of Carlito. There should be at least some characters from the original movie, the ending has no meaning in relation to the original. At the end of this movie, he retires with his sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of jail in the next movie? And his wife is not even the same woman he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say that the film is slightly entertaining in itself, with some decent fragments, but it pales when it is held by its older brother. Do not stay awake at night waiting to see this, look at the original one more time if you really need a hit.
