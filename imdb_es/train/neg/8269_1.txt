This esteemed production has its fans. But paraphrasing the classic bad criticism of 'Mary Reilly', Moby Dick is like a painting, but slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical basis for a "production" of a film is never to make a great movie. rather it is to replace the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case, a transfer of books to a film) with a list of not very dynamic, not very dynamic but dazzling concepts in an effort to deceive viewers into thinking that they have seen the greatness. As viewers and critics are willing to fall for this, the Oscars follow, feeding the whole foolish equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all these critics found. Moby Dick is incredibly carefree. The actors diligently recite essays about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all the things they can not answer, none of which is absorbing in the least. It is dramatically inert. Do not build In narrative terms, Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than an inevitable conclusion in search of a real story. After half an hour, he was muttering: "Oh, fantastic ... another oath ... another soliloquy of 4 minutes!" <br /> <br /> In the unsuccessful effort to get involved, it's an exaggerated showcase rather campy. A lot of gray hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a gold god. (!) <br /> <br /> You know you're looking at a great director when you make the medium your own instead of trying to replicate the feeling of someone else's palette and pictures, or embalming with reverence a classic like Huston does it here. . The paintings and the books are beautiful but they are a different medium. A film like this fails to understand that a piece of shit that is enjoyed honestly (Village of the Damned) is better in most aspects than an unbearable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables film school. <br /> <br /> One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; the registration of slums as a means to structure work and various marine efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that does not require a movie of more than two hours.
