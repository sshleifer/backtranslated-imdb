With the MASIVE advertising that Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. are receiving and that guy, my son was bothering us to see him. Between the DVD and the theaters, I've seen almost everything, from the standouts (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad ones (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've seen, children or not children. It was a "when will this stupidity end?" kind of experience? Okay, it is aimed at young children (or rather, it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone over 3 years old), but I have never seen anything so predictable, repetitive and slow. Then, once you are finally tired but relieved that the movie is over, there is a strange thing in the end that you think is the setting of a joke, but there is not one, it is serious, although it is difficult to say what. They are trying to achieve The 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, they are a big problem, otherwise you will not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son got bored at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in all aspects.
