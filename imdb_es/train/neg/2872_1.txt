This is by far the worst horror thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers you this for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a more foolish person to know that you saw it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ... it's the acting, the camera work, the lighting and the sound. There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Whoever paid to have this movie made is now broken. I hope the director never gets the green light for another movie. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual capture of BTK's killer, but I've seen movies of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this.
