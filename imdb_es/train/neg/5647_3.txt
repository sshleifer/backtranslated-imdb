We bought this series on DVD due to all the enthusiastic reviews we had seen here. I gave him three stars because there is no doubt that sometimes the acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we did not see the propaganda that was transmitted so well in the series. If you look at it with discernment, you will see the whole litany of radical right-wing beliefs promulgated by the Fox News Network (Faux). To avoid giving away any spoilers, I will refrain from pointing out all the dozens of specific cases. A brief look at the plots found here in IMDb will reveal that everything from torture to gun control, to the right of a network to provide "Infomercials" and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and passionate speeches given by some of the best actors. in the world. We saw many programs and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all types of torture should be used to protect us all. The series also manages to demean gay men and women in a subtle way by using them as plot devices that represent evil people. In general, the complete litany of the radical religious right. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the history of this program will be used by future historians as proof that the United States was lost in the first part of this century. As a history student, I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and part of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be, therefore, do it. Just be sure to buy a low-cost used copy to avoid enrichment from the right-wing Faux Network that produced this parody.
