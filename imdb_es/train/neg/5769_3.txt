Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in its concept, it has actually failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully represented, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A big problem with them, however, is the great excess of light that blooms. It's horrible, although I think it helps to give the film a dream quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to keep in mind is the terrible voice that acts. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, the voice actor of Emo is HORRIBLE. I guess when you have a budget that basically equals zero, you can not afford to hire real voice actors. For me, it seems that they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is not going anywhere. It seems to me that it is more like a kind of movie "look what we can do" instead of a real movie. The plot does not go anywhere and fails to really show any interesting point. The whole movie looks like it was made as an excuse to make the areas look interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be worth a quick download from the official site, but do not expect anything except pretty graphics.
