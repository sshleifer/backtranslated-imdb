This British / Spanish co-production full of stars looks very good, what you can see of it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so bad that it seems that the buildings are having conversations with each other. Few films suffer as much for the panorama and the scan as this one, since the director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the process of widescreen that he tended to use both sides of the screen at the same time, neglecting the medium. Another user comments that we see all the inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; Not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, a Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never discovered why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, since his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence in which Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing with a bowler hat and a bad suit in the great tradition of the great English music room until the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics that I've never heard before. On the positive side, the location is excellent, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading to nowhere, some beautiful landscapes by Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I really did not like this movie, but I have not seen it exactly. I will look for the widescreen version and I will make my decision then.
