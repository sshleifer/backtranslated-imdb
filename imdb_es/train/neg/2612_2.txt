The only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians were their nominations for the original song and the costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was not very impressed with this movie. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way, Glen Close fulfills very well with this role) leaves the hospital due to her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals and keeps all her skins. From that moment, we only wait until she starts to have a crisis. Very soon, she does it and tries to make the best coat in the fashion world, of course, for her and for Dalmatian's fine fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found the whole cast quite silly, but fun for a child. That's fair enough since their target market is, I suppose, children under 12 years old. Quite a good entertainment for children and families, but it did not do much for me. * outside *****
