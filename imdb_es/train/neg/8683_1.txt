This show is not smart. That is basically what is reduced. The "original humor" that these writers try to achieve to avoid completely avoiding the rest of the bush hunt in the world is not funny at all. In another comment, someone cites a couple of hilarious lines. The highlight for me was George H.W. Bush tells the children that they are not supposed to watch television, in addition to Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with stupidity as this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are getting a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush has not been a good president. We all do it But that is not an excuse to put out this awful waste of time. I put these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. With your formula, eliminate all topical jokes that are no longer fun and add even worse material so you can give yourself credit. <br /> <br /> Again, it's just bad. Without grace, and that makes me increasingly unhappy that this shit is renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are preserved after 3 solid seasons. Please, do not look at this shit, unless you're one of those liberal-blooded green hippies who think of some phrase with the words Bush and dumb is comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice stinks. All he does is emulate a Texas accent and exhale very loudly at the end of his prayers. At least South Park admits that the voices are not accurate. If you want a funny political satire, look at the Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for any political sketch in Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since the animation of the stop motion action figure is EXTREMELY well done. Look for George Bush as a bit of Jedi on youtube. Priceless
