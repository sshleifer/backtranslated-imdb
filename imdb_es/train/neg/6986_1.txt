I can not understand Al Pacino. I see it in the Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'm seeing one of the best actors of the last thirty years. Then I see it in Two for the money, any Sunday and the Revolution, and I wonder what the boy is thinking. <br /> <br /> I came across Revolution a few nights ago and I thought I would invest the next two. hours in this Here is a news flash: Do you want the prisoners to talk? Oblige them to see this again and again ... they will confess anything. <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the argument because there is no coherent argument, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated farmer who does not want to get involved, but ultimately does. Although he has no money, he has no education and he dresses like a caveman, Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they only have two minutes of dialogue together. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if "Al Smith" starred in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino", it would have ruined his career. The script was horrible, but Pacino's unmotivated performance and the obvious false accent made it even worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was ridiculous. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but she has about 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody talks much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the movie's most comical premises is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this strange ability to continually find themselves on the battlefield. It's like all the Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to see you here again, on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I have to give this star from IMDb, since there is nothing. Here for a negative score.
