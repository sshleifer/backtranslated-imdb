1st seen 05/17/2002 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The fairly filmed version of this much-publicized event is the rather slim account of the Titanic disaster. The replica of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes silly, badly performed and too much like a soap opera. The story is very similar to the most recent Oscar winner, except that it shows us how the team tried to hide the real disaster that was happening until almost too late. Only for purposes of nostalgia and to have an idea of ​​what James Cameron was fighting against (hardly ??) in his recreation.
