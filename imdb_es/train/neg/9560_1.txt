Thank God, I saw him at a friend's house and I did not pay him. The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a television show. If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics, be careful. You will feel that the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress who became Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst performance I've seen, excluding porn. He's lucky that Matt Lanter is really decent. He is the one who takes the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate having lost almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame they call it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
