Before I start, I love Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest fighters of today. Possibly that means I'm going to go into this with too high expectations, but I just did not find Eddie fun in this exit. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for that. But in Circle, it seems to be more irrelevant than fun, and it has completely lost me in some places. A lot of the topics that he covers that he has covered before, I even think I recognized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD, you will find a behind the scenes look at Eddie's tour. (Interesting in some places, but not very fun), and a French version of one of his shows. Fans will love to see Eddie in a different language, but subtitled comedy is not very fun. <br /> <br /> If you're an Eddie fan, you already have it or you're going to buy what I say. If you are just passing through, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill, you will not be disappointed. With Circle, you probably will.
