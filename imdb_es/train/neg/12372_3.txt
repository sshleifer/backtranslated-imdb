I had many expectations about this movie (the title, translated, is "How do we get rid of others"). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has assumed the consequences of the constant verbal and legislative persecution of the right-wing government to the so-called pirates and the left wing in general, and decided to simply kill everyone . who can not prove that he is contributing anything to the establishment (the establishment is called "the common good", but in reality it means the interests of the dominant capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very good idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely blows your chance. Satire appears only in some scenes and absurd performances, but this satire does not hold; It is neither sharp nor witty. And for a supposed comedy, the movie has almost no funny scenes. Comedy, I suppose, is supposed to be in the absurdity of situations, but situations are largely uncomfortable and too serious, instead of evoking laughter or thoughts. <br /> <br /> The script is full of bass. Errors in the layout. The action should have focused on the political aspects and the wrong thing to do, but instead, a lot of time is spent on a young woman who was the one who wrote the new laws to have fun, and who is trying to save everyone . , organizing a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this is next to the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement But it does not even begin to really address the problem it is supposed to be about. Maybe I was afraid to go too far? What a coward That is not art. It is not even a true satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, a very serious and now one of the most important actors in Denmark, was very good. In large part it bore the little entertainment value that the movie had. All the others: nothing special (well, perhaps except for Lene Poulsen, who provided convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, one problem with most Danish films is that the language never seems natural. Neither the formulation nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound good? Why should it be so forced and artificial? I hope that when people see these films in fifty years, do not think that this is how people in Danish society in general spoke. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
