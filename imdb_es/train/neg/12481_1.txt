The history of the sword and the witchcraft of a frightfully brutal and cruel "hero" who defeats an evil king has no value in almost every detail. The acting is horrible from the drivers to the supporting roles. The rejoicing and rejoicing with which the director shows the hero staining blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed by any kind of justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people he is fighting with. The Z-movie edition is abundant, including a scene in which a character "dies" by a sword stroke that was obviously lost completely. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly committed to the charms of the female protagonists, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who mostly walks naked throughout the film. As a man of 20 or more years, I will not pretend that the female flesh on the screen does not appeal to me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and cheerful, that I could not even enjoy this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed. for a happy, ironic feeling (the sequel is better in this sense), but DEATHSTALKER seems to be taken completely seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid it at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of ****.
