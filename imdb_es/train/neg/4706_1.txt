That's right, you heard me that this movie is a damn 'ABOMINATION'. First of all, the band, who the hell is going to see or listen to a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! Not only the name is terrible, but also the musicians, they can not even touch anything! In addition, the singer sounds more feminine than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! They are not only terrible musicians, but terrible actors. Directed by a shitty director and a thin plot, this has to be the stupidest movie in history. I wish this website would allow you to use a vote of ZERO OR UNDER 10, because giving this filth a 1/10 is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can call it a comedy movie. If you're looking for a comedy with music, go to that "Weird Al" Yankovic because he does so much better than these untalented preteens.
