Superhero movies almost always suck, and this is no exception. His only redeeming quality is the fact that the film COULD have been even worse. I would put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' on top of this movie, so yes, it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, look 'Blankman' is not a "Serious "Superhero movie but at least it's entertaining.
