As a member of the cast, I was a member of the band in all the basketball games, I would like the world to know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was because the producers and the director broke the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. It seems that the sign U of O was shown. While we were filming, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met. Enough time for a young man of 20 years. To tell you the truth, it's not what life on campus really was in the late '60s and early' 70s, despite what Hollywood might think. Oregon Trombone Player
