The case of the crazy is to kill college students, the new teacher can stop the madness?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not mind. <br /> <br /> With a degree like Splatter University, one would do it immediately. I guess this movie is not a great art. But worse than that, Splatter University does not even qualify for funny garbage. Splatter U is so badly made: the story does not make sense, the characters are disposable and the whole movie lacks the essence of the imagination. It goes without saying that there is no suspense or atmosphere or fear. This nonsense is not even brave enough to shed any nudity (for the cheapest emotion of all). Therefore, all this infinitely defective slasher offers nothing in terms of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and becomes a complete boredom. Bottom of the barrel people: even slasher fans must die twice before seeing, let alone pay for this movie. <br /> <br /> **** PUMP
