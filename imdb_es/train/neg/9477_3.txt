This had to be one of the most beautiful terrible fights in history and was only saved with 2 games. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete wash and, to be honest, I almost fell asleep, it was so useless, that the coffin game was not worthy of Undertaker and that the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke If you really are a big fan of WWE and you've missed the first days of WWF and Wrestlemania 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I found that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.
