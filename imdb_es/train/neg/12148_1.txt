Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie a rating of 8.1? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie stinks! This film is nothing more than an amateur movie, or possibly a student film. I'm a fan of movies, and I've seen terrible movies, but here literally there was nothing to trade. The story and the performance was the worst I've ever seen. The accessories, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, were as bad as anything else. I'm wrong for the bad language in the movies, but the F-Bomb was eliminated every third word and I think we could have a winner for the greater use of the F-Bomb in any movie. The film also seems to have been shot with cheap video cameras and not with real movies. I hope this gets awards for an amateur movie that is shown only at public access stations across the country, but it does not belong on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is a valuable time that you will NEVER return. Unfortunately for me, that time has been lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this as a warning.
