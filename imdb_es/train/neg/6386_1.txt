I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply impossible. The performance was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, very slow. All the time sitting in the theater I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minutes in a movie and I'm praying for an ending. Of course some of the images were nice, but come on guys, I mean it! And for a movie about a man tuning magical instruments, there really was not much music to talk about. The music there was annoying, and boring. There were noisy and shrill sounds, sometimes also annoying. Mainly this movie got bored and at the same time it scared me. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I need to go see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.
