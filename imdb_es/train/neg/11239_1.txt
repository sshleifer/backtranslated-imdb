Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about this movie should receive royalties. This is a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a comedy or slasher video. They would receive a D for this. College students would receive an F or they would be asked to leave school. Since this "monstrosity was made by" Professionals ", I think there should be time in jail or at least a trial period at the cinema.I like to watch bad movies like" Plan 9 From Outer Space ", but this does not even enter In that category, the script, the acting, the sound and the direction are so bad that you can hardly see them, if you like to watch bad movies that are fun, stay with Ed Wood, blaxploitation or the horror movies of the 70s After seeing this, you have the feeling of having lost an hour and a half of your life.
