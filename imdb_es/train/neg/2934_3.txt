Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young, an idiot and stupidly stupid Brit who works as a famous journalist in this American comedy. After a stroke of luck, he starts working at the respected Sharps magazine directed by Jeff Bridges in New York. It's more The devil wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Kirsten Dunst provides the unlikely interest in love that works well with Pegg for laughter, but they do not light the screen with their passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget his journalistic principles to get material in the magazine. Of course, she is finally seduced by the glitz and glamor of the celebrity world, especially the young star Sophie Maes (Megan Fox of the Transformers). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will be wondering if Pegg himself experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and, to a certain extent, Run Fat Boy Run as one of the best comedic talent in the UK to be He has ruined the United States. <Br /> <br /> Everything in all this is a forgettable comedy. Please come back with us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
