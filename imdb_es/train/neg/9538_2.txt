When I saw the commercial for this, it was all about seeing it. Now, forgive me, but it's been so long since I've seen it that I do not remember how it was. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw was not at all like the "movie" in which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, upset and incredibly disappointed by this movie. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that horrible reggae music. It's not exactly the music that creates the mood for a horror movie, right? I suppose if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you may think that this is a hot topic. For my money, the commercial was much better.
