William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation, and in that moderately funny, it has been appropriate to expand his role and exaggerate. As it happened in the original Star Trek series. I suppose I will never understand American humor, which is often overlooked in order to convey the message. I vote with my feet. I do not see the show anymore, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast was good. It's a shame that Shatner's exaggerated role also affects the performance of James Spader. But most of them show how society is doing, I suppose. I do not travel on the same routes. Frank
