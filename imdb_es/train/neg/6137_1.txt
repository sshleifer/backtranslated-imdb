Phew. What can be said about Gymkata that has not already been? This is nothing but pure happiness from beginning to end. If you want a movie that keeps you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. From the red-mullet / wild-style sweater combo from Cabot to Parmistan (and their four billion ninjas), everything in this movie reeks of shit. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the scene of the mirror in the game of the death of Bruce Lee, shows once again his complete lack of talent to direct. Some other faces that you probably will not recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you will not remember them or worry about them once the movie is over. <br /> <br /> Supposedly based on a book called "The Terrible Game", which, if I could find a single trace of its existence anywhere, I would be interested in reading it, to see where it went wrong. Instead, the book is apparently a product of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something that Clouse has invented to sell his boring idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this and Yakmallah for you. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've seen in my life, and that's saying a lot.
