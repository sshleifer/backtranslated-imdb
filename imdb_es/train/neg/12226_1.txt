I know, I know, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Hands, the hands of destiny". But I can not get nervous with those sock-monkey movies. Of course they are bad. How could they be good? But if you're talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and bankable talent, the T. rex of all the turkeys has to be "Yentl". All the falsehood, all the self-absorbed asininity, which dyes everything that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its climax in this film. From his lonely top of horror, "Yentl" looks back to "A Star is Born" and then to "The Mirror has two faces". There is nothing more like that. I can not imagine the emotional current that dragged Streisand to make this film that he would rather not speculate, and to what audience he was playing. I do not think it's a possibility among nine out of ten. /> <br /> Nobel Prize winner and holy guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did with his story that he criticized her in public for it. It's a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only did not commit suicide but made more frightening films.
