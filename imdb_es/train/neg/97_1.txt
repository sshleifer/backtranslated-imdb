I must admit that I have not seen many low-budget films, but this is the worst movie in history, the main character the old man talked about, had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds. One year old could act better. The story had the most terrible plot, and well, the army guy had put what he thought was the army and then he went over, I just saw him to laugh at how bad he was, and I expected him to be the real movie. . I can not believe I was under the 2 night rental in blockbusters, instead of please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was a semi decent actor who was not the woman, I think the only thing that was right with the budget was the makeup, but they show every important scene of the movie at the beginning. Horrible just horrible
