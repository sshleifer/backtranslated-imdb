What were you thinking about "Cannes"? One of the most irritating movies of all time. All the details of this movie, no matter how pointless it was shown. If I had to see her put on her boots one more time, I think she would have screamed. If the objective of this film was to show how pathetic Rosetta's life was, she covered herself within the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the credits should have been executed. But no, we had to watch innumerable redundant scenes over and over again. Everything was full of unpleasant and unfriendly characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think that I overlooked "Tumbleweeds" to see this film of exaggerated boredom. It was like watching the grass grow, only it's more exciting.
