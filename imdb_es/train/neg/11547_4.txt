What kind of shit is this? Power rangers vs Freddy? It was visible and as good as the first movie at the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists get superpowers in their dreams, it started to become childish. This sh * t should have been qualified as PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see some very mature things, but it was only for the third of the movie. The rest are for small children. He is too focused on Christianity. I know that Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting against demons. Why does Christianity always have to be? This is total Orientalism and is full of white men / Western superiority. Do not look at this, show it to the little children who love the forest rangers.
