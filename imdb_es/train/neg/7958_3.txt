Protégé runs in a linear fashion; Do not wait for an accelerated action, and you will not find yourself with primed breath because there are simply no moments to sit on the edge. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a crux, so do not do it. expecting one either I would not blame the performance: the show would have been much worse if it were not for Wu's performance, which was the only salvation of the movie. And, oh, that pretty girl too. <br /> <br /> Humor is, at best, weak, and the program should also function as an anti-drug campaign that employs the usual shock tactic (especially in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us things that we already know - that is, drugs divide families, heroin drives you crazy, is not so easy to wean, you will fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may seem a bit harsh, but I feel that the program is far from perfect and somewhat irregular (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was taken to the station of police: what, they said to us 'oh, we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and that is how they caught him in. No, there is no action to chase a car, just a skip, which it undermined Wu's role as an undercover in the first place.) I suspect that the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that, after all, it is a production of Mediacorp Raintree, a Singapore film production company.
