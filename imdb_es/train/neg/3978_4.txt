When In Rome is a definite improvement in How to get there. Arriving there seemed too predictable, artificial and slow, and to this day I still consider him the worst of the Olsen twins. However, although When In Rome is not a terrible movie, it is not a great movie either. If I had to summarize it in one word, I would say passable. It's fun for teens, but I think adults will not find much to follow. <br /> <br /> When In Rome has its positive points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. I admit that when I was about 10 years old, I liked them a lot and, in general, I still like them. And I've enjoyed some of his films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back to the goal, both girls do not do their job so bad, in fact they are very attractive. Also, their outfits are to die for, and the landscape of Rome is absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is not bad either. <br /> <br /> However, when the film collapses it is in the plot and the script. The script is mostly cliche and has indications of deja vu. The plot, like most of the films of Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone who is familiar with any other work of the Olsen twins will find some unoriginal elements. Most of the characters are thin cardboard, and you do not learn much about them, and sometimes the rhythm is uneven. Unfortunately, the stunning landscape is spoiled by camera work instead of slapdash, which seemed to be constantly rushing. <br /> <br /> In general, it has its positive points, and you can certainly see it. However, to my liking, it is harmless and predictable teenage fuzz. 4/10 Bethany Cox
