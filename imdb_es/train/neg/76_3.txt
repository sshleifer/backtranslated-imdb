I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> It's shallow, two-dimensional, it does not affect and, hard to believe given the subject, boring. The actors are passable, but they did not have much to work with, given the very laborious and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would over-intellectualize, he may be comfortable with the fact that this storytelling is absolutely without any literary depth, counted completely on the surface and filled with central casting standards. However, it does not work like a popcorn movie either. His pace is too off-center and his ability is too low to satisfy even the level of a mundane activist. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Gregor Jordan can sit down and say to himself "this is the best I could have done with the material". <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and so is the national response to him. Possibly a popular genius, possibly a class warrior, possibly a psychopath and probably all of these things, he has mastered the true Australian mythology for more than 120 years. Once again, his story has failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Such is life.
