After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerated transformation into a man-bat creature. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, it is all due to rabies or anti-rabies drugs that he The local policeman believes that John is responsible for several horrifying murders. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a horrible movie. The script is boring and there is no gore or nudity. This piece of senseless shit is so boring of minds that you will scratch your head with total disbelief after suffering it. Even the design of a man-creature of a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and not memorable. Avoid this smelly like plague.2 of 10
