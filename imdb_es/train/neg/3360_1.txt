Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one secret to writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them. If at the end the door bursts open and a ten-foot-tall insect staggers, the reader may be a little scared, but he will also think, "Well, I can deal with that, at least I was not FIVE feet tall. "There is nothing more terrifying than what is hidden, invisible and unknown, just on the other side of that closed door, waiting for you. <br /> <br /> THE HAUNTING is so completely wrong that director Jan De Bont more or less begins his film opening that door metaphorically and shouting: "Look, everyone, look! It's a ten-foot-tall insect Is not that SCARY ?! " The law of diminishing returns goes into action immediately. At the end of the film, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, pounding his CGI pots and pans with madness, and shouting hoarsely: "Look, everyone, look! Here come! Ten insects from a hundred feet tall! ... And now, here come one hundred and fifty feet tall insects! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers apparently believed that only special effects could compensate for all the other deficiencies in this effort ( and there are many.) They can not and can not.In fact, however impressive they are, the special effects are so insistent and annoying that the distracted spectator stares at them, either in admiration or annoyance, instead of being immersed in them. a story. <br /> <br /> For me, the nadir of the sheer stupidity of this film occurs when a statue, with "blood" sprouting from its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) The filmmakers clearly did not know what to do with this supposed id Once they had it, they only make Neeson shake a little in the water, waving his arms and falling off glug. In the next scene, the good doctor apparently dried up and, ah, forgot about the whole annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been stunned by this ridiculous script by a committee of teenage low-IQ drug addicts who thought that the way to scare people was to make each effect bigger. and stronger: "Well, then let's make the ceiling look like a creepy face and, uh, come down on it ... and all these pointy things, like, catch her in bed." <br /> <br /> The only salvation of THE HAUNTING is that in the end it becomes so horrible that it's really fun. When Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell to the ground and then went to his Death-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I myself fell to the ground, laughing. <br /> <br /> Poorly built, no Grotesque wit, heavy-handed, absolutely incredible, and full of clumsy dialogues and meaningless scenes, this HAUNTING vacuum is an example of a textbook of how NOT to make a movie of terror.
