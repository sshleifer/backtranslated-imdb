I reviewed this movie when I still had 6 votes and it said like 7.2 or something like that, but seriously this is a horrible movie. We are going to break it down The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was shot on a hand-held digital camera owned by a freshman at a community college. The next thing you'll notice is that the actors are all friends of that first-year student (he probably met them at the pub the night before. Third on the list you'll notice that the music edition is horrible, and they try to cram This film, at intervals of 30 seconds ... also the entire digital edition is done on said freshman PC at home ... probably using Windows Movie Maker This movie was horrible ... pretentious, had an undeniably bad script and acted That way, I followed the example, I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I do condemn the writer and the director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
