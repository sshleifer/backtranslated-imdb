I caught this in a screening test. All I can say is: What ... the ... hell? This film develops as well as Mickey Mouse reading the script of "Scarface". It is strange beyond having the slightest sense; And even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so strange that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile containing a CIA probe. The CIA comes after Irwin retrieves his investigation, Irwin confuses them with poachers and intends to "stop them." <br /> <br /> That's all about the history that exists; the rest is an exaggeration of the Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin rides a high-speed vehicle and fights knives with a CIA agent on top. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's knife is fighting a guy on top of an RV. Let me be your guide for this ridiculously bad movie.
