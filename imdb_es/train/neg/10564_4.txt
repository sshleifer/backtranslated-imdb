The real shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad performance, nor in the despicably superficial plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series that started, even though it had one main attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. She has that sarcasm, that wit, that double-edged personality that is both volatile and adorable. Unfortunately, however, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story that involves murder. Patricia Tallman, who never returned seriously to the series until much later, fortunately improved a lot with the age of Lyta Alexander, who here is little more than a weeping and bored telepath. I'll leave you with one last thought: why does Delenn look like a frogman in outer space (even if it's a woman)? Thank God for the way the Minbari looked later in the show.
