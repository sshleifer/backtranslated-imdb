I saw this movie without knowing anything about it in advance. The plot was terrible, with large lacunae of missing information. The film did not have the feeling of "battle of wits" for me. The actors simply threw bites of nonsense, sometimes making me grind my teeth in agony as they continued to sound. The plot was predictable, except for the homo-erotic scene of the end of the stomach upset (I'm not homophobic, but it made me feel physically sick in my stomach), even the ending was predictable. And you could say that the detective was Jude Law in a disguise, everything, from the false accent, the terrible dental work, the facial hair of the costume shop, everything pointed to it was a disguise. The whole movie felt like a lost time of my life. This movie had the feeling of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to see the show, really booing in my opinion.
