((NB: Spoiler warning, as it is!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a teenage movie, the genre of Spam-in-A-Cabin, as Joe Bob put it Briggs. If you are looking for Roshambo, this is not and will not be. I am desperately impressed by the stabs in his cinematography, direction or acting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this was not Zúñiga's first horror film, it was his first period of appearance on screen, cinema, television, whatever. For what it's worth; neither Daphne Zuniga, Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you have to give even a little support for the slasher. Of course, it follows the profoundly insulting formulation message of its kind: any young woman who has or shows interest in sex is the flesh in the hoof, and the time of harvest is now. <br /> <br /> Except that it gives the touch to the sweet, virginal protagonist too! Now there is a mediocre movie about the death of teenagers that has the courage of their convictions! Interesting that this was the only role of the ingenue movie. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the girl too much credit. <br /> <br /> (On the other hand, this movie probably has one of the highest percentages of actors in a movie in history.) Of the nineteen credited actors, thirteen thirteen never appeared in any other film. another movie from the same producers, only another one apart from Zuniga has up to six screen credits, what was this, the Mutual Aid Society has been and has never been?) <br /> <br /> Of course, I saw it A long time ago on the wire at night when I was bored and I never anticipated getting bored again in my life, but I see no reason to hunt everyone involved and throw them in the Incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
