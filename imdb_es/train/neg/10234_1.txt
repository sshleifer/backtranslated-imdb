I will keep this short; Thanks to Greg for helping me put this succinctly: the captive is a guy who drinks the drink of a girl, imprisons and torture, then poses as a captive to have sex with her. That is the only twist and punchline of the movie. It's torture like slow-motion rape. And, it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad, it's good; It is simply bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that among the critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they do not dare to break, even though some were tempted to do so because it is very vile. Why NO ONE had the balls to move forward and say, "This is rubbish, and that's why" is beyond my reach. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these street vendors.
