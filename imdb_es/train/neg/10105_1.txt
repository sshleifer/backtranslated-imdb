Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked in my little Comcastic box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hi, I love zombie movies. He says that the filmmaker has some kind of cult in the description. It's funny that you do not warn me not to watch this movie. I could have used that advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is like Troll 2 in that it is completely misnamed. It has little (if it depends on your point of view) to do with the zombies, and it takes place within the same city. This movie revolves around a crooked policeman, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck so much), while arresting women for trivial nonsense and then killing them. Yes, he is a serial killer cop. This movie is not only defective in thinking it is a zombie movie, but it also makes your serial killer data completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, live for it and get depressed and personalize with it. This guy hits the women and injects them with some poison. He does not even have sex with the corpse or dismembered him. Talk about boring! Finally, one of the five women who kill has the protection against voodoo and, for no apparent reason, the five come back to life and leave to kill this guy. All were buried or thrown into the ocean, but you would not know, buy the clean and sharp clothes that everyone wears. Women act very badly and take revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was crap in all categories. Fucking performances, crap writing, crappier sets and crappier makeup effects. Women do not look like zombies, unless you consider that the dark makeup around the eyes is the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. Everyone can talk, behave, think and act perfectly human. Blood is weak compared to many PG-13 movies and nudity is more than brief. You see a glimpse of the breasts in the opening sequence ... Then the same breasts later! Go figure. I guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this. The police station is so badly built that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse where they are obviously filming. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the settings too low and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing. Stay away, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
