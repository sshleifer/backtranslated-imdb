A great success after the release with the Australian public, it can still be fun today, but its excessive political imprecision and its direct and subtle humor can make it a little cringer. It continues too long; part of <br /> <br /> the content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which in any case desperately needed something new. Of course, your Australian attitude is fun, but it also becomes annoying as the movie goes on. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? The adventures of Barry McKenzie will become a milestone in Australian cinema, but we should do everything we can to make sure that foreign audiences do not see most Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, actually, Mick Dundees!) . Score: 5/10
