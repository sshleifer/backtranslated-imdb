I was quite pleased to find this film in the local video library: Cary Grant in a comedy set in services, director Stanley Donen, until now, what do I not like? It's the kind of movie that makes me wonder two things: when did all those involved (including some well-known names) realize that they had a turkey in their hands, and what is the worst of this among a number of contending aspects? Still reflecting on the first, but my vote for the latter is directed to the serpentine plot, before the sometimes pretentious myth, the uncertain tone, the lack of coherent and well-developed characterization and the lack of relationship between the characters. You must add a very unequal performance to the criticism, but it is understandable that the actors had difficulties with this and, in addition, they seem little rehearsed. Very often they can barely get their lines out fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban personality, but sometimes seems uncomfortable and choppy in his presentation. I have to say, however, that I was relieved when the initial suggestions of his character were paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield disappeared with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What do I like about the movie? - for me, mainly the beauty of Parker, who also acts in moderation and with a dignity similar to that of Grace Kelly. In general, the movie is nice to watch. The naval characters are very intelligent in their uniforms, however, you really have to be surprised by the frightening black robes of Fu Manchu that they wear in their luxurious hotel suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in his. Back on the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and, for me, there was interest in listening to the pre-Hogan heroes, Werner Klemperer, without the supposed German accent!
