This movie sucks. The performance stank, the script stunk and the movie in general stunk. There were two threads in the film that did not develop and the viewer had to do a little work to find out what was happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying I should explain myself, but suddenly you find things that happen and you're told as if you had no idea what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> The negative comments of the heroine about the hero. The audience is never shown how he even knows anything about the boy and how he is tied to the death of his fianc√©. The viewer also has a minimal exposure to the death of the boy. <br /> <br /> In addition, suddenly there is a scene with a group of guys loading and arming machine guns and that's all you see before you cut out the other scenes. There is no explanation about the weapons and the people who accompany them. <br /> <br /> We gave it a 3 because we did not feel like we wanted to go back. It was fun to talk badly about the movie while watching it, so at least it gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
