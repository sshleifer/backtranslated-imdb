Taking into account the limits of this film (the whole movie in one place, a music studio: only a total of 5 or 6 actors) should have done much better. If you have these limits to make a movie, how could lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they talked a little bit below the performance in Clerks, except it was a nice movie, this had no substance. Well, he tried, but it really fails. <br /> <br /> It makes an attempt to self-reference in a couple of parts, but the lines were so deficient on the part of the actors that it was bad. And the main character of Neal Guy, that pathetic looser. Clearly, about 10 people in total made this "movie" and everyone knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band they had, but unfortunately, these people really have no idea how terrible they are. This was done in 2005, but they all look so bad that it seems they are just from the pre-grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand offers again!) But it was under the title "The Possessed" not Studio 666, no matter what you do to the title, you can not help it . This could have been a much better made film: there is no excuse for this bad filmmaking when it has the obvious and limited parameters that the filmmakers had when they did this; Working within those limits, you must do the things you can control and things. You can work with the best you can. Instead, they thought that mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video, wow, that was bad, I got over it quickly. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you like the shit out of the whole movie, I guess you'll go see this. .
