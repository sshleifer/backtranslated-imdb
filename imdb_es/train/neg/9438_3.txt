Have you ever seen a movie that lost the plot? Well, this did not even have one to begin with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painful and tedious scenes of our heroine who sits in the house and who does not really have any sense of threat or even foreboding created even during the seemingly constant storms (which strangely are never heard in the large glazing of the house) ? The house that apparently is only a few kilometers from a city but is several hours away (?) Or the third girl who is useless in the plot, except to provide a surprisingly fast bloody murder just when the tedium turns unbearable? Or even the beginning, which suggests a series of more than 20 murders in the entire area, although it is clear that the murderer never ventures far from home? Or the strange ritual with salt and pepper that practically sums up most of the films inherent in the lack of direction. <br /> <br /> Add a main actress who can not act, but at least she is willing to do something completely irrelevant. Nude shower scenes and this video is really nasty, but not the way you expect. <br /> <br /> Considering the following simply because it was banned in the UK in the 1980s (mainly due to a surprisingly extensive final murder) it offers nothing more than curiosity value, and a classic murder " silly "(do not worry, it was telegraphed at least ten minutes before). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the woods, our victim arrives at a fairly steep place. uphill that obviously struggle up. Halfway there, they see a figure in the upper part dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Swipe down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not, they fight to the top and place themselves properly and upright in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie as they say ...
