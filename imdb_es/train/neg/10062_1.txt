Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can not believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this at the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to continue ... oh God ... where do I start? The plot sucked. The acting voice sucked. The animation sucked. The end really sucked. If you liked this movie, you also suck. And for Futuramafan1987, who said that this was the best movie in history, you are a TOOL, SIMPLE AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone, except for those of ten years with Game Boys who think that Pikachu is God. I still cry to this day, thinking about that horrible movie ... and then there was Pikachu's Adventure ... I do not even mean that horrible disaster of a movie. It is, in truth, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Do not go see this at any cost. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: go out, find all the copies of this movie that you can and record them. Burn them all, and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
