I was not particularly impressed by this film that has mediocre music and only lasts 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was falling asleep. I make an excellent use of time lapse photography to show the passage of time in the movement of lights and shadows, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's it. <br /> <br /> My preference is for his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to show that a sequel can be better than the original, the Powaqqatsi made in 1988 lasted 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both.
