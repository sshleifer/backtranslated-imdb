This is even worse than the original game of death. An incoherent and incomprehensible plot leads "Billy Lo" to fall from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, while letting us follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only do we start to follow a clone of Bruce Lee, the movie kills him and allows us to follow another thirty minutes of the story. The main reason to see this is when Bobby Lo is fighting a lion, which is obviously a man in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, which is usually quite impressive, but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly I observed this and the original Game of Death because they are part of Bruce Lee's box. No wonder they are included in Lee's finished works. Nobody would buy them any other way.
