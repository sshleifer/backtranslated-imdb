I'm probably one of the few spectators who would not recommend this movie. Thought visually impressive as all the work of Ang Lee (each frame seems to be worthy of an impression), I was very disappointed in the disconnected rhythm of the film. It really was too long. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the era of the Civil War in Missouri, and it's about a man (Roedel) who joins the wild forces of the Bushwackers, a kind of renegade Confederate sympathizers who lead geurilla Type of fight with the Jayhawkers, their union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after the father of Chile shot himself at point-blank range and his house was burned, probably by Jayhawkers. The story follows the assault adventures of Roedel and Chiles and their interactions with other victims of the war, including the former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a war widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that each time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it used another secondary plot and left things undeveloped. For example, the turmoil among the Roedel group caused by the former Holt slave who participates in the Confederate cause is briefly shown through some conflict regarding property and protocol, and then removed until later in the film. A young Villian / stalker Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much anguish and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to come to the surface; I think that's because the film embraces many of them, as well as large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I loved seeing the house, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought that the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, although they stumbled a bit with the dialogue. However, unless you really enjoy the story or you're a big Ang Lee fan, take a pass.
