This is a bad movie. Not one of the bad fun, either. This is a terrible bad. It was really painful to see him. The direction was horrible, with many jumps and the green and yellow tones used in the film make the characters look bad. Keira Knightly was not as convincing as a tough girl, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke have signed this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and the acting was like nails on a blackboard. If you have not seen it, do not do it. You are not missing anything and you will only lose two hours of your life seeing this stupidity. I've seen bad movies before and I've even enjoyed them because of their failures. This is just a waste of time.
