Dieter Bohlen, the famous German composer and producer of pop hits a bit trashy like "You're my heart, you're my soul" felt the need to tell his story, and gracefully decided to hire a ghostwriter. The result was a fun book about his life. Well, pretty much a blurry image of it. He did not deny that he is a selfish asshole, but the whole story twisted to fit his self-image. Not a word that he probably hit his ex-wife and that she ended up in the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and a great success after his appearance as a member of the jury of the German version of "American Idol", especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - Really. In the hype of the mentioned television program "Idol" called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (DSDS abbreviated), someone must have had the terrible idea of ​​making a film of the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film". <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a movie that tries to be so funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really touch the point. Naddel's voice and the style of speaking became immediately nervous, although Verona's voice should have done more. Obvious, childish, predictable and long gags destroy any motivation to see this movie until the end in a few minutes. The content of the film is a sloppy film adaptation carelessly written by a ghostwriter based on Bohlen's neglected idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally disinterested and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole movie is not satirical. <br /> <br /> No wonder it was considered bad for a cinematic premiere. The likelihood of this rotting in some file was quite high until recently, when the current DSDS season turned out to be a mediocre success. With the "friendly" help of the biggest yellow newspaper in Germany, "BILD", and the desperate situation that the RTL TV station has something on the program while the still unsurpassed show "Wetten dass ...?" is running on Channel 2, the movie finally reached television, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time; there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story that is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
