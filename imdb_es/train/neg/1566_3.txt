For the Beatles enthusiast, the main value of this movie is simply to sit down and choose faults, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, exaggerated events, omitted people, errors in the timeline, wrong appointments, incorrect dress, place songs, and (embarrassment shame) wrong instruments and other boners that I can not think of at this time. The faults become fast and furious, so you'll have to be on alert. <br /> <br /> I did not give it a "1" mainly because it was filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it their all (the character of Lennon is credible and does a good job). In addition, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at a given moment and THAT counts for SOMETHING. <br /> <br /> So, look at it for fun, but please do not take it as historically accurate.
