Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To have an opportunity to get an education, Babs disguises himself with enthusiasm as a child, which is not the hardest thing to do as it seems. a child, anyway. In his new school, he meets many male partners who have no problem believing he is a man. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best of many moments of involuntary humor when Babs' friend thinks he is a man. , but he places it on the ground, sits on top of 'him' and looks affectionately at his 'eyes' ... * giggles *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre movie; A striking story about nothing particularly interesting.
