The plot of this film is based on an important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving and attentive father. It's not that being a father and murderer is impossible. But this man is shown murdering a teenager without provocation or reason or emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold to someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, he could have been so cold and worry about his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask the parents of his victim to welcome and care for his daughter is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters were condemned by the actors. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bakula's eyes made him seem more cold and threatening than he usually is. You could not see in his eyes at all.
