When you see the little man, you will spend your career time trying to discover his many holes in the plot. And that's not a good sign because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You're supposed to be laughing at that! But you will probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little man is his concept: it's too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoon comedy), so when noisy, overworked and exaggerated jokes come into play, they make Everything The thing seems ten times more stupid than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy", some of you may be screaming. That's true, but that's not an excuse for such a silly plan. I mean, think about it if you saw a baby with A GROWN MANS FACE, would not you suspect in the least? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why did not he put it on a nearby shelf instead of a random handbag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that Calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about the laughter" could be screaming. Well, here's the thing, almost no laughs in the little man and that only makes the plot of the ass stand out even more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a Wayans Brothers comedy with a plot of suspense of beliefs, stick to the white girls because at least that had some decent laughs.
