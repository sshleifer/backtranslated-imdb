In the opening scene of "Malta Story," Mr. A. Guinness had such a striking resemblance to Noel Coward that he expected his first words to be "Certain women need to hit regularly, like gongs" or something like that. his dialogue is not an immortal prose and even the Master would have had trouble giving it life. In fact, Mr. Guinness wanders around the image as if he were looking for a focal point and not finding it. And there lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie. Mr. J. Hawkins also gives up and ends up giving a "Jack Hawkins" performance without an ounce of individuality. It could have been spliced ​​from any of a dozen British war movies. Many of the fifty habitual suspects usually appear and appear. Your ability for very little purpose. The Luftwaffe did not bomb Malta in the same way that it could not kneel in London. The King recognized the courage of the Maltese in the face of incessant danger and the island received the Cross of George. worthy subject that could think for a film, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most condescending sense. It gives the appearance of being hastily crowded to meet a deadline, perhaps before the actors missed the opportunity. he will live.
