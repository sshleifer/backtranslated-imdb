This movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any of the characters and the story developed horribly. It was a definite dream. You would expect the action scenes in a movie like this to be your strengths, but D-Wars surprises you even with a disappointment in that department. <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance was only one step above the level of a low budget porn movie. And i mean it. <br /> <br /> I was actually happy to see the final credits in this case because it was so bad! Please, whatever you do, people, do not waste your time and money on a shitty movie like D-Wars.
