Do not watch this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective vision, my friends and I estimate that each of us lost 5% of our brains during their course. The only person involved in his creation who was not clinically insane was the set designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in the mouth. Now I realize that instead of a feeling of repulsion, this movie has generated a deep hatred inside me. I really hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Some might say that this movie should not be taken seriously. If only he did not take himself seriously. But he does it. The plot is a warm version of the Blade Runner-esque universe fused with the cheap rubber suits that prevail in bad dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not only childish and meaningless, it is often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like nails in the soul. And whether it is Juliet Landua with her British accent again or Richard Roundtree (also known as Shaft) as the Commissioner, she will be immersed in a growing feeling of disbelief and disillusionment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only for anyone who wants to see the depth of stupidity to which humanity can fall.
