I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that's how I heard about this movie, I really do not know if it was in the theater. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of those specials after school. The acting is fine, it's not great. The plot was somewhat weak and the lines were quite cheesy. So, the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh". I borrowed Jeremy's movie. If I were in a movie rental place, this would be one I would go through and after seeing it I would not recommend it to anyone. Average school age I have also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, the jargon is overused or simply obsolete. Many times I think that is what makes his characters incredible.
