I just give this one a three because he fulfilled what my friends and I expected him to do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this out thinking it would be a zombie movie with Romero or Fulci, but what I rented was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie to have fun, or a movie that makes you shake your head with embarrassment, do it. This is perfect for fans of "Mystery Science Theater", but the only drawback is that it is so bad that it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title we might know, because when a movie sucks like that, it has its own genre.
