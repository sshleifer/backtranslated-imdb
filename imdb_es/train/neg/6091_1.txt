I bought this exciting and gloriously free movie, at the top, a fun bloodbath. I do not have any of them. This movie fails on virtually every level, not the most frightening or funny, it's just a terrible movie, and it never gives the audience anything worth seeing. What is so bad is that, far from being so crude, violent and brutal as he had promised, there is very little violence at all. There is virtually no bloodshed, and no emotion at all. Acting, directing and dialoguing is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really laughable. I could barely sit through this total trash once; I certainly will never want to see him again. Do not waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; It really is possibly the worst movie ever made. If I could give you less stars, I would.
