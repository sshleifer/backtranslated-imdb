I liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still as good as Gabriel, suddenly the idea becomes a bit ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, get the first movie and forget the sequels, because they can take away all the joy of the original.
