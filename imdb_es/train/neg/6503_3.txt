What Hopkins achieves with this effort as a writer and director gives us the feeling that we do not know anyone in the film. However, maybe that's where the problem lies. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and very deep, but it is very impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who is nobody, therefore, there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be a screenwriter that intermingles with his own characters. It is? Perhaps. With that I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I want to say that there is no need to say. The Hopkins movie is an experiment. At first glance, one could argue that he is an aspiring screenwriter, who at the moment of his encounter with destiny, realizes that life is unpredictable and / or success is a blind opportunity, since It casts a "glide" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. However, it is so incessantly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even in the minuscule and rather rudimentary measure of allowing us a connection with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the nippy and the extravagant school of work and the editing of shaky cameras at machine-gun speed took me away from the subject, but as I reflect on the film I am beginning to realize that I had a lot to see with that There are so many films of the last decade in which the cuts or the movement of the camera have sound effects, as well as other technical elements that deteriorate the atmosphere. I suppose that in this case he was justified because his purpose was to compose the impressionistic response capacity of dreams. However, I barely knew anything about Slipstream when I saw it, and I came out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us care. There are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and weave, unaware of their presence. Slipstream is the latest.
