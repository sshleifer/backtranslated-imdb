It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor and waste it in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually quite good, but I can not stand it when the actors do the same in more than one movie. I think he grows old, and that is the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his presumption is shown in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed admirer, but his role in this film is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro is IN this movie, that makes it a draw if you're a fan (no pun)) that sees everything he does no matter how bad it is be. But to see De Niro at his best, see "Midnight Run," "Goodfellas," or "Cop Land," or even come back and take a look at "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II." Do not waste your time with this game. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
