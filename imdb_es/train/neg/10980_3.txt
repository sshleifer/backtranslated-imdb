A really scary movie. It feels as if it was done in the early 90's by a heterosexual person who wanted to prove that homosexuals are good, normal people and aspiring to the mainstream. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path for the salvation of sad, lonely, and crazed gays by sex. Woohoo! Who knows? The secondary characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate jester, the bitter and lonely queen, the fag of the tide, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle-class clones, middle-class, of little interest. <br /> <br /> As regards the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple, there is not much to say: we have seen everything before, and we have done much better.
