['Wow, the plot of this movie is all over the place! There are so many plots and so many things that happen that they practically made me turn my head! And, as a result, none of that seemed particularly credible. <br /><br /> The film begins with Kay Francis as a housewife who lives in a small town. She has some experience with the local theater and has ambitions to go to Broadway. When an important actor arrives in the city, she pursues him with the hope that she can give a boost to her career. But, her husband is worried about the scams, since this actor is a cad. Therefore, the husband breaks in and hits the actor, and the actor dies! As a result, he is convicted of murder in the first degree! Not homicide, but murder 1! Now, pregnant and in need of funds, Kay goes to New York. But you can not find jobs on Broadway, so she is forced to accept any job, including Burlesque. Unable to properly care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise her. However, eventually she finds a job in a true Broadway play and everything looks good. But the jealous diva who plays the part hates it for some inexplicable reason and forces her to abandon the work. Dejected, she goes to England and becomes a true star. Years later, he returns to New York to look for his daughter, but the girl is older and thinks that the woman who takes care of her is her real mother. At the same time, her husband&#39;s lawyer now thinks that if he gets $ 10,000, he can get the man out of jail. As another critic wrote, is this to bribe people? Otherwise, how can you get $ 10,000? Maybe buy a helicopter so they can fly to the prison yard and pick it up! Wow - this is enough for 2 or 3 movies! And, all this happens for the 45 minute mark !!! Believe it or not, there is much more than that. If you really care, check it yourself to discover how everything develops. <br /><br /> This is something like &#39;writing in the kitchen sink&#39;: throwing practically everything and waiting, somehow, everything will work. Unfortunately, the film turns out to be incredibly amazing and soft despite Francis&#39;s best efforts. It&#39;s the kind of movie that nobody could have saved thanks to a second-rate plot. It&#39;s almost as if someone had taken a few dozen elements of the plot, put them in a box and then started to select them to make a movie! In general, unless you&#39;re a Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood has done in the 1930s, this is one you can easily skip. It&#39;s not terrible but it&#39;s certainly not good. <br /><br /> By the way, the girl who plays Francis&#39;s daughter when she returned to New York (Sybil Jason) really was terrible. I think she was supposed to be ... I think.']
