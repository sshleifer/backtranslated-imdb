This started badly, it got worse, and when the girl attacked the old woman at the end, she literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed and drown the C ** T to death. To avoid this movie, some good photography and some nude shots, it would be almost acceptable if I were 14 years old and I would not have seen Jenna Jameson nude a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this movie, I would strongly recommend that you spend your time more appropriately, as an example, I would say that trying to put a Lego house on your butt without lubricant would be a good start. I heard that this movie was not the original version, I would very much like to see the original, since it seems that this cropped version lacks all plot, and apparently most of the nudity, can someone tell me how I can get it? In contact with Christian Viel he owes me one hour of my life!
