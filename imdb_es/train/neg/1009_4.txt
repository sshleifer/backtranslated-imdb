*** THE REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this brief and sweet review. I bought this movie at Best Buy because it seemed interested and had some of the best actors, like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, an aspiring journalist who finds a case that can lead corrupt police officers to Edison's police force. LL Cool J is Deed, a police force within a special force team called F.R.A.T. (Assault Tactics on the First Response). It was associated with a "bad cop" named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed attacking some bank robbers, but at night they are attacking a couple of guys who use drugs. I do not want to give much further, but things go bad for those who take drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes to a trial involving Deeds and Lazerov. Suspicious of foul play and with the help of Ashford, does a little research that becomes ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all inside the F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt policemen to justice. <br /> <br /> It can be said from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance is quite lackluster. The only person who gives a total return is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete case of madness in this movie and he made me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. It says all the lines in the same way and shows almost the same emotion. It was much better in films like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The movie starts with a good action, but then drags it in for the rest of the movie. The ending is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. I'm going to put it on Ebay this weekend.
