This film has little to recommend, although the landscape, the cinematography and the direction of wildlife are impressive, it is difficult to highlight their weaknesses in the company of such favorable reviews. However, it is precisely these things that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my children and none of us was very impressed by the end. Yes, the images were great, the wide landscapes through the forest and the magnificent mountains, but what was happening in the foreground? The rather boring account of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns very slowly a very basic lesson on how to make friends with wildlife, and easily fades taking into account the history of that kind of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can really be deduced from this movie is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and the lighting of the forest; The rest is a waste of time.
