History and performance cheap and disconcerting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the roll of bloper included in the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun they had. The occult and esoteric base was apathetically non-authentic, and the antagonists could not be creepy or credible. The "homoerotic" nuances were uselessly docile and unsatisfactory, and were limited to the small children who caressed their breasts while they were limp in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action could at least have kept me and my girlfriend awake.
