This movie was programmed to be a very successful movie, and it really is. This is the kind of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch the eye-catching graphics. With that in mind, the movie offers, perhaps not as well as the ultra-flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Out of the action of chewing popcorn and special effects, the film falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many spectators, including myself, will complain about how most of the characters were seriously disturbed, but that only makes the film a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This movie is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The manufacturers focused more on making it attractive to the eye than to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to cameos of 4 scenes. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are thrown on the side of the road to make way for the big surprise. The character of Wolverine is fully developed after 30 minutes, like Sabertooth, although Victor makes some surprises at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The "final boss" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the film. It is an original character and barely achieves a development that shows only why it is the way it is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really had to do was create a character who could do whatever they wanted and slapped the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
