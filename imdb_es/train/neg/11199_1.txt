The turgid rhythm of this movie numbs us before any shock it can provide. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were insipid. The priest's Irish priest was as lame as the love interest. The interest is deceptive. The girl they chose to provide the sensuality of the movie could be better. The central conflict of the main character was involuntary. This film completely lacks positive aspects. It's like a tedious exercise for someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but he did it anyway.
