Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went to Italy, tired of the glamor treatment of Hollywood. First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resistant actress. And now it is EUROPE 51, another tedious exercise in a soggy feeling. <br /> <br /> The story also does not do much for Alexander KNOX, in another ungrateful role as his long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death. of his young son. At least it has better production values ​​and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but is moving towards a more common appearance as a woman of rich society. She can never cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite the attempts of a kind friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going crazy," she tells her husband. A portentous statement in a film that lacks humor or grace, but gives us an idea of ​​where the story is going. <br /> <br /> Bergman will soon be motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome. But being a social worker with poor children does not improve their emotional health and, from there, the plot will get worse. <br /> <br /> The general effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to turn it into a project. For a great star like Bergman. The film loses its rhythm in the middle of the story as Bergman becomes more and more disturbed and her husband suspects that she is cheating him. The story goes downhill from there after she takes care of a street walker through her terminal illness. The final thread of the plot makes her husband have to place her to be observed in an asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid nobly suffers all this (excessive compensation for the loss of her son) but it does not help. It is not one of his best films, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: if she wanted neorealism with a mental illness, it could have been better for her to accept the lead role in THE SNAKE PIT when she was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! He would have done more for his career than EUROPE 51. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Another grim indiscretion by Rossellini and Bergman.
