Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines summarize this little shitty movie that can only attract idiot kids and their parents to the movies. and his ... # 1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese lady who falls asleep in 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It is grotesque and horrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (No) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play with two hipsters who will try to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They'll try to chase Sam-I-Am and that bad guy who's running away with that. (I hope they do not ruin the classic book). Do not waste time and money to see this.
