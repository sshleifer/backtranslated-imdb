As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was excited when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will turn this book into a movie after the story actually written by the author." Incorrect!!! If the casting director intended to choose a "Jane" that was clear, he certainly did. However, I surely could have found one that could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the eerie suspense of the novel when laughter floated in the night seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the spark of the girl who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders if the writers had read the book. What a disappointment
