Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) stars in this boring and unimpressive "action" movie as Deputy Geronimo, a chubby and chubby guy who sits in a stupid-looking cowboy outfit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile, a vaguely criminal guy named Palermo (played by the one who owned the mock in Fulci's GATES OF HELL) runs into Joe Don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a badly edited scene. Joe Don, slowly, chases and frees Palermo's brother after pronouncing his now legendary phrase: "It's your decision." Do you think you can take me? Well, go ahead. ' For some reason, Joe Don, a member of Texas law, must transport Palermo to Italy ("Mr. Palermo has been one of the main discomforts for the Italian government," says Mr. Wilson, another vague character played by Bill McKinney, who was in MASTER NINJA 1, SHE FREAK, and many good Clint Eastwood movies). <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don's plane must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. And that's where the movie stops. During the rest of the film, Joe Don searches for Palermo, releases Palermo, ends up in a jail cell, the Maltese police chief yells at him and then releases him with a warning that he no longer looks for Palermo. Then, Joe Don continues to look for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a jail cell, shouts at the Maltese police chief and then releases him with a warning that he no longer looks for Palermo. Then, Joe Don looks for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a jail cell, shouts at the Maltese police chief and then releases him with a warning that he will not look for more in Palermo. This is a film that aggravates. <br /> <br /> At one point, it is believed that Joe Don is dead at sea. All the other characters wonder if he is dead or not, and finally conclude that he is dead. But then he appears (he was rescued by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. Even his cute companion Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque does not welcome him. However, he offers to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don looks for Palermo, releases Palermo, ends up in a jail cell, shouts at the police chief of Malta and then warns him not to look for Palermo more . <br /> <br /> The highlights include, a strange carnival with strange colorful floats, some sexy strippers, a shootout involving a child dressed as Napoleon, and a tomato cart, a chase scene involving a man dressed as a monk, and any scene without Joe Don. The low points include Joe Don threatening a stripper with a coat rack. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is from Greydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, who appears as the sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
