Okay, I fought to put aside the fact that by selling the EVP as real, the movie was basically lying to me from the beginning. I reasoned that hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula to be able to live with this. <br /> <br /> However, even with that, the accepted film is not very good. It's done and done competently, but it does not really capture you at all. There are several moments of "jump", and I looked at them and thought "yes, I did not expect that" without jumping in the least. <br /> <br /> Also, the resolution does not make sense. If the force behind this is able to do the things that it seems to be, then why the hell do you need to use a proxy? In addition, the legend was absurd. Obviously, they put it there as part of the question of "granting credibility to the film by stating that everything is real," but for that to work, it really must be at the beginning. But they can not put it at the beginning because then they give the plot ... hitting it in the end only made it stand out like a sore thumb.
