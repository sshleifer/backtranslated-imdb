This reboot is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's "The Incredible Hulk", very good but very underestimated. <br /> <br /> "The Hulk" by Ang Lee is a comic book for the thinking person. The Hulk takes a while to appear (about 40 minutes), but when it does, we see the conflict in the core of our protagonist. He does everything possible to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he surrenders to his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this with Edward Norton's turn, where there is no sign of conflict in his personality, and he becomes Hulk every time he gets aroused and his pulse reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this critic, he felt similar to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which indicate how strong "strength" is with one, as if mystical abilities could be measured through a blood test. In the 2008 film, all Bruce Norton should do is keep his pulse below 200, as controlled by a device attached to his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get a pulse rate of up to 200, even through a very stimulating career, especially for a person in good physical condition. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. On the surface it is quiet, but below it there is a significant anger, enough anger to feed the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never intentionally kills, not even its attackers. Above all, he just wants to get away or be close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It incapacitates its shooters and, in a critical scene, saves a fighter plane from pursuing a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as needed. Action scenes (and there are many of them) are necessary for the plot, unlike the 2008 film where the action is inserted for the sake of action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn her into a "fugitive" In the story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment that went wrong. And Louis Leterrier, the director who takes up the clue of Ed Norton, does not add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as: Banner is chased and Hulk kicks his butt, chases Banner and kicks Hulk butt. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film is that it may not be as true to comics as the 2008 version. However, although I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a movie that is not so faithful to comics like a fanboy's dream, but one that has a heart over comics, but made and soulless version 2008 at any time. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a film that is true to its comic roots and has a heart.
