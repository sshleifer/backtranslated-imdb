It saddens me that such a fascinating period of history and so rich in material for the film could become a boring event. Wm C Quantrill was hardly shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the time. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would grieve for his murdered sister every time he went to battle, was completely absent from the script. Instead, we were forced to see fictional characters who never became someone we cared about. how sad. However, the costumes were wonderful, as was filming in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee makes another film of the time and try again, or some other filmmaker will examine the enormous wealth of material to write a screen work.
