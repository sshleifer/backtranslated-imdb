Christ. A sequel to one of the most impaled movies of all time, at least has the decency to set aside the songs (except for a repetition of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but continues the tradition of being nauseating and without grace. This time, Annie and her friends leave for London and get caught up in Joan Collins' plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or something. The film has a strangely flattering attitude towards its character of the same name, in disagreement with how annoying it is: every time the little bitch screams "Jumping lizards!" I could feel my teeth clenching in dust. Photographed sadly, muddy and laborious, the film only has one memorable line ("Do not tell me, stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original to recommend it.
