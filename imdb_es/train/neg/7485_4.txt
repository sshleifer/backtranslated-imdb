Of course, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a comedy by Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you will notice. <br /> <br /> In truth, Martin, the protagonist, is misinformed. He is not making the great slapstick for which he is known in films like "The Jerk", but he plays a kind of intermediate character that does not work. Hawn, with no one to play with, is terrible. Cleese is the only member even partially funny. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much could have changed, but it seems that the characters lack the slightest common sense. They were wrong in New York, doing nothing right, and unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only is the premise completely unbelievable, but it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme that is repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, instead of seeing this, re-rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
