As soon as it reaches the screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms! But on behalf of its producers, I must say that it is not included in any category of known films, it deserves a new name of its own! It's a "neurological drama"! It saddens and depresses every neuron in a person's brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing you can have to a stroke without actually suffering one. It leaves you speechless, all your limbs go numb, your mouth opens and stays that way, and the strangest symptom of all is that you want to remain blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> It is not a great feat for ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¿¡¡
