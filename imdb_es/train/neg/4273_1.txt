There is nothing unique in the television series or in the movie. Which is a prequel to the television show, which is not found anywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches disgusting style of telling stories, and after. <br /> <br /> From the moment, the body of a poor and wrong girl washed on the beach. And being introduced to some of the most immature and dark and immoral characters of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> For the mind that almost numbs pedophilia in a disgusting way, the film seems to relate romantically the destruction of a Human Life through some randomness. Psychedelic phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk, walk with me. <br /> <br /> I saw everything just to make sure I was not missing anything. I did not It is simply an obvious sexual fetishism that extends throughout a long series covered by a ridiculous film too pornographic. Keep the agony, the suspense and see anything else that, at least, has the ability to tell a story, instead of seducing him to participate in some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I have heard many reviews, comments and praises about how great David Lynch is. Because of its ability to define misery and tragedy and turn it into something wonderful. This is not to imitate the art of life, but it is a twisted and sick version of art that does everything possible to inspire a life without meaning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this crap.
