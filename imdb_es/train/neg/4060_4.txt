THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 2.35: 1 (Chromoscopio) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Prints of 35 and 70 mm) <br /> <br /> A former blind journalist (Karl Malden) hears a blackmail plot outside a genetic research lab and then joins a reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders in the laboratory, which, unknowingly, put their loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> They rushed into production after the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PENALTY (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a gial thriller in the same He felt that his predecessor, while acclaiming the famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden (recently appeared in PATTON (1969)) and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film, which according to the ads was "nine times more suspense" than "Bird", is a disappointing follow-up, immaculately photographed and executed with style, but too laborious and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are eminently visible in sympathetic roles, and filmmaker Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the broad framework of the Chromoscope to convey the high-tech world in which the grim setting unfolds. of Argento, but the secondary plot that involves the euro star Catherine Spaak (LA LIBERTINA) since the romantic interest of Franciscus is nothing more than an unnecessary filler.

The devious machinations of the murderer. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film moves aimlessly from one scene to another, over low heat without actually boiling. No wonder "Cat" has failed to emulate the uncontrolled success of "Bird" when it was launched in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
