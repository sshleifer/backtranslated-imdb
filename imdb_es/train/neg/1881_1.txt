This movie sucks ass. Something about a heat wave in some European country, complete garbage. There is nothing for this movie at all. Maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying girl who gets hooked with people and really bothers me. This movie is a complete rash and you should not be subject to seeing it. I'm sorry it's very boring. I would rate it as zero but I can not. No body in its right mind should see this. I'm sure you'll completely regret that I did it. How could they think of something so bad? Even mysterious men were better. MEN OF THE MYSTERY. That stinks. That movie was not worth being made. A complete waste of time. The characters in this are very difficult to understand and I am very bored.
