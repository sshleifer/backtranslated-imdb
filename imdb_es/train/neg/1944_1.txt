I've grown up with Scooby Doo all my life, my dad grew up with Scooby Doo. We have just seen the first episode of the parody that calls itself Shaggy and Scooby to get a clue. What planet are Warner Bros? The characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my twin cousins ​​of 3 years (who are also fans of Scooby Doo). Scooby and Shaggy just are not! If someone, except Casey Kasem, does Shaggy's voice, it just is not going to work! Trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was embarrassing. The new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format? Pick up this piece of trash and go back to the real Scooby.
