I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I had not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. The performance of all parties was bad, except for Mr. Lundgren, who was fine. Kata Dob√≥ was pleasant to look at despite her ridiculous attire and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not entirely intelligent, it is something that has been repeated a million times in different films. The thieves were completely stereotyped, and Lundgren's character had no depth. I really did not expect a masterpiece from the movie, but unfortunately this is not even a decent action. Every twist in the plot is extremely predictable and the incredible amount of excessive unrealism and comic book characters started to bother me very much very soon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to young children who want something. Comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I guess the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in the making of this film)
