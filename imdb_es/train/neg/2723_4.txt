The films of Claire Denis seem to fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or silent and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it is not as terrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat" I made a point to see every new movie that Denis makes. And he has always disappointed me. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She still has to make a film as personal and moving as the first. <br /> <br /> You get many of Denis' regular customers: a bigger but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie just to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her wide neckline and a couple of beautiful coats; the black man of "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was interesting enough, but the camera took so long that I got angry at the strand of hair that hung over his forehead and I was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think he finally cut it. <br /> <br /> There was certainly some action: horrifying murders, the search for a son by a man, and there may even be a plot, but one view was not enough to resolve it, and two visits are, I'm afraid, out of question. On the one hand, the score was discordant and annoying (as in "Beau Travail"). On the other hand, the seasons changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was happening. Oh, there were some nice pictures, and if you liked "Friday Evening" with your photos of the heavy curtains and sheets, you could appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis film rarely equals more than five pages, double-spaced and with wide margins. In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus", it's just boring.
