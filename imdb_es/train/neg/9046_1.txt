Now for the truth, it's a very weak story, for a Walt Disney movie it's a total garbage. When the robinsons appeared, the movies everywhere, I was surprised how poor they were. It's like "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong! It feels like they're short on ideas, some mixed some crazy trash to try to get away with it, and they do not. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest halfway and history confused him. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear, you do not mind the ending, you just want the movie to end. It's a movie to forget, and quickly forget. If you have free time, do not waste it on this.
