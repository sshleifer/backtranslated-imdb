"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless film that simply hangs between the cable channels that occupy space like a dime novel in the public library. A bit useless and a first effort for the mediocre director Seidelman, the film is loaded with bad acting, bad sound, malfunction of the camera and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the best films never reach the market and why junk movies like this one do and never seem to disappear is one of the great mysteries of life. (RE-)
