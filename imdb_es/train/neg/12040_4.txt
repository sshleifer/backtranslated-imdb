I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of that story. However, as an independent film I found it very boring. The battle scenes tried to be big and spectacular, but they were CGI obvious. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad and, undoubtedly, Brad Pitt was chosen to attract the ladies. But he's not a good warrior, very nice, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> The good thing is the design. This movie looks good with the landscape and the castle buildings / impressive walls. I like a movie that, at least, tries to make the characters have true accents, but this movie seems to ignore it completely. We hear anything from American or Scottish English, but what can be expected from a movie about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this movie for a seated family. It's too long and young people will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's okay if you do not mind the lack of realism.
