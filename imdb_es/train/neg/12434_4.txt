In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and moving comedy. The best he has ever done. Ten years later, it has been reduced to recycling again the plot of 'Solo en casa' in this second sequel, which is not related to the other films, but it is not inspired and sadistic. The four thieves ?? that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for presenting this revolutionary change to the series! ?? They are electrocuted with metal chairs, they have brains with dumbbells and they are blinded with paint, ha ha ha ha ha ha, while the new child is even less charming than Culkin. One would think that the exit of almost all the key players of the first two films would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he did not even show up for "Home Alone 4".
