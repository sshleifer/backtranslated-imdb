This is a low budget parody of the espionage genre. To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The performance is tremendously tough. The stars are having a lot of fun delivering their lines with excessive movements of the eyes, frequent hand gestures and out of tune rhythm. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Often, the lines are abruptly discordant and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to the elements of the previous plot. (3) Shots are often framed at off-balance angles, mocking the excesses of gender. (4) A Jeff Goldblum with bulging eyes offers a complex and classically absurd dialogue in a sarcastic and winning way. <br /> <br /> The film has a guiding intelligence, which begins deliberately with an element of the plot stolen from the B movies of the 1930s: a secret code with a structure that would challenge Carl Sagan's explanation. The exaggerated performance of the film is mainly used for comic effects during the first 90 minutes. In one of the first jokes, Fay Grim's son is told to leave, he can not help laughing as he feels sorry for the boy. The beautifully choreographed fall of Parker Posey also helps set a humorous tone at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not improve the elements of the comedy or the dramatic elements that emerge later. The impact of the film as a drama is significantly diminished by early comedy. In addition, it is difficult to be too involved with the characters and their fate when the first parts of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy, and I found this (and the angles of the camera out of the ordinary) more irritating than comical. <br /> <br /> The most unlikely and almost incomprehensible conspiracy plot / against conspiracies, and the slow pace will grind up in many viewers. The movie is too long in 158 minutes. <br /> <br /> That said, fans who are receptive to the sarcasm of the movie might want to see them again ... using subtitles to better capture the clever ridiculousness of the dialogue. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more awkward than cheerful. But, comedy can well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth it for those who enjoy independent films, the fans of director Hal Harley or the devotees of Parker Posey (who has more camera time).
