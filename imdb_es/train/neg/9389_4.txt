According to IMDb, as well as to any other website that has a revision; This "thing" has no director. Well, that would surely explain a lot! Only a group of people who gathered to film some perverted pornographic sequences and cast an ultra-thin story about devil worship and women's sacrifices within the walls of an isolated sanitarium. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of a misrepresentation of the 70 totally demented, since it is made with a minimum of production values ​​and scripting inspiration. The horror films about satanic cults were very popular during the early 70's and also pornography, why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac who has committed to an asylum, and since the first night she is already involved in a drug network, psychedelic orgies, rapes, tortures and actions with dilemmas. Actually, a lot of dildo-action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but her throat is cut even on the same night. The aspects of horror are really badly crafted, and range from the masks of Satan, ridiculously frightening, to the virulent attacks of cut penises. Photography and acting performances are almost intolerable for amateurs, but what do you expect from a movie that features images of dildos that shoot sperm and amputated male reproductive organs that speak? The protagonist, Justina Lynn, is a pretty pretty girl with a dazzling body, but most of her co-stars (men and women) are horrible and with excessively hairy hair.
