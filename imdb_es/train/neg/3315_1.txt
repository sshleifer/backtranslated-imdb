Bah. Another tired and reworked rework of a non-copyrighted work that was never designed to be filmed. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Toni Collette is excellent as always (being a real actress, you'll see), and there are some delivery cuts very well managed between scenes. There are even some genuinely funny lines, and the work of the film, the score and the editing are competent, apart from a strange twist in the voice-over and talking to the camera towards the conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and almost everyone is clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. Worse still, they are all talking "Austinese", that peculiar self-satisfied falsetto singing a song that could not be further from the way people actually spoke in the days of Austen (I think Yosemite Sam, no joke). This is particularly sad, considering that it seems that we are finally seeing the disappearance of the equally facial "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his friends wanted to scream at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> And worst of all. Everything is Gwyneth Paltrow. She has only played a single character in her films, and she remains true to her form here, going through her entire range (smiling in a bad mood) in the first ten minutes, and then repeating herself for the rest of the movie . There is absolutely no chemistry between her and any of her admirers, or any apparent reason why they are interested in her apart. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, there are very few reasons to keep an eye on Emma. It's a pretty nice adaptation, but if you're going to pack a film full of anachronisms (that is, an incredibly thin track that can not shoot a bow or handle a vintage accent), then you could do it properly, as with the enormously superior "Clueless"
