As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and humiliating for single women over 40, not to mention any other woman, of any age. It was a sad and pathetic attempt on the part of a man to write and direct a "movie for girls", and failed miserably. For starters, Andy McDowell is not a great actress, but given the non-existent "plot" (I hate to refer to her as a plot), she had no chance. There was no development of the character, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, or attempt to make the film realistic or credible. And then there is the compelling male fantasy of an attractive heterosexual woman who suddenly decides to try lesbianism. PLEASE. <br /> <br /> I not only want to be able to recover my money for DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. Go scam.
