My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention that she shared an office with him. When it was announced that he was BTK, she was surprised. The whole day was only when he told stories about how he would never have seen him as the Wichita Assassin. I've heard her tell them many times. I asked him about many things and I attended all the interviews that he was asked to attend. I read the whole book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that something like this could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another BTK movie on TV not so long ago, and I thought that this would have been better at portraying the murders of Dennis, maybe even having some smart touches to his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very direct with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mom's description of him, all my readings about him and the videotapes I've seen him talking about. <br /> <br /> First, the angles of the camera were horrible. It seemed as if it had been filmed on a domestic video camera. The acting was terrible and I could not even stand to see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and a type of person who "follows the rules". He was not as kind as the movie made him see, he was very polite and abrupt, like business. The same goes for their murders, for all we know. If you have seen your confession in court, you can guess. <br /> <br /> And as for the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No. I've never read or Dennis Raider has confessed that he has a problem with animal cruelty or people who crush insects. In fact, he practiced with cats and dogs for choking methods. However, throughout the film, he was putting animals on his victim's face and acting as if he cared about their welfare. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never killed people he knew, he confessed this. but in the movie in his first murder, he tells the lady that he also knows her. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to go to this movie and I'm already ranting. This is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in the real events of BTK. This is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want a badly shot half porn with some killing scenes on the side, this is your kind of movie.
