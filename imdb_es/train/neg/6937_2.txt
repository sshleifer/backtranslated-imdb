The subject that this last publicist becomes an actor in his debut (ad) is a very old discussion topic by almost any cultural standard: the timeless romance (pun). <br /> <br /> However, the exploration (and exploitation for Desi auds) is unfortunately short, since the usual inclinations of "seasoning, seasoning and adding sugar" to the usual mixture of b / c scoring. g, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. They create an attractive package. With little inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. More repetitions continue through the movie (after all the main character is a cook). But there lies the problem, there is no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh puts in Cheeni Jyada (more) the amount of excess action. Really when this guy is ever going to stop? How many of 60 and so move like this, even when they are bothered by a nubile of 30 and so many? Timeless mind, yes, but surely what happens to the body not so eternal? And sole? I'm sorry, soul ?! Reasonably good performance of Paresh Rawal, who has the only sensitive role in the film. The director lacks a sense of realism when caught in his new discovery of a new idea. Nowhere do we have problems or real-life problems that a couple may face, apart from getting married, which is only the initial obstacle. The secondary plot of a young child with cancer (the first love of the unmarried boy) is not going anywhere and no matter how unimportant this insipid presentation would have been, it will be quickly eliminated along with the character of the girl. <br /> <br /> Anyway, good try, but not quite yet.
