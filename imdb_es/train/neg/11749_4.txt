Phil the Alien is one of those extravagant movies in which humor is based on the rarity of everything instead of the real punchlines. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was very strange and quite funny, but as the movie progressed, I did not. Find jokes or fun oddities. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget movie (that's never a problem in itself), there were some interesting characters, but in the end I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this movie would attract a fool who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar but better try "Brother from another planet"
