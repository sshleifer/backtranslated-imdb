Pet Sematary, although a nice horror movie from the 80s, with a good director and atmosphere, IS a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas of this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the floor, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiarism But, being Stephen Kind, a famous American writer, it is totally normal for him to get away with it, obviously it is due to the huge difference between this kind of Italian films without a budget (and in part, it is a shit in itself. ..) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
