As others have pointed out, this film is criminally inaccurate in its representation of the artist's life and, for my part, I was very upset and offended ... by the transformation of his rape into a tragic romance, by the implication that his rapist he was responsible for 'awakening his talent', for his total disdain for his work, for the way he turned her into a sexual object, again and again, the idea is understood. Also, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi see this film and leave with that kind of impression of it.
