America. A land of freedom, hope and dreams. This is the nation that, since its independence, has endeavored to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world, for the good of all humanity. However, there are times when one can not help but wish that Americans simply stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' (and I use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a strange jewel thief who was created by joining the severed head of Marlon Wayan to the body of a two-foot-tall dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a large diamond into Vanessa's bag, a career woman who resists having children, Calvin realizes that to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with it. So, as any normal man would, Calvin dresses as a 2-year-old boy and parks at the poor woman's door, where Darryl, Vanessa's husband, discovers him. <br /> <br /> Darryl falls unquestionably in love with Calvin's disguise, even though the "baby" has a complete set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife scar and the sex drive of a 16-year-old child. years. old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa also does not see beyond Calvin's baby clothes and, in reality, tries to breastfeed the tiny pervert. However, this unfortunate assault on the soul of humanity tries, and fails, to find humor in rape, eschatology, sexual assault and pedophilia, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of "family entertainment" in which Wayan brothers move. an unhealthy amount of defective feeling and morality. <br /> <br /> The brothers attempted a Freudian rehabilitation of their rapist thief by revealing that he "had a bad father". Repeatedly striking Darryl in the crotch allows Calvin to develop the loving relationship between father and son that both he and Darryl have always wanted. As if this were not ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convinces her that it is selfish for a woman to pursue a successful career, and that instead, she should spend her life playing the role of the small woman confined in the home. , who spends her time alternately taking the babies out and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Wayan brothers have mixed their crude and twisted form of humor with the clich√© sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent work. In addition, they are endemic to the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow of themselves that indulges in sexual jokes and jokes. For rights, these two should be legally forbidden from collecting anything remotely resembling a camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current moral and artistic bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and will be making millions of dollars from commercial deals.
