I felt like I had seen this movie thousands of times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to twist a little, every time I expected something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but what I expected. As "The bread factory opened another facility, because there was not enough bread." In two words: flat story, which has become a clich√©, bad acting, special bad effects ... Only the foolish Russian policeman, Vlad, was a little funny while punishing the bad guys. The pile of muscles was incredibly STUPID. that made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie ... It will not get worse (because it's not possible): D
