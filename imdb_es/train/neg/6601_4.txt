I can see why Laurel and Hardy purists might be offended by this rather soft "recreation," but this movie would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of the classic L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain, so reasonable. The comedy duo and there's a pretty good cast. I loved it.
