This movie has a very difficult premise to swallow, even by the standards of this genre. We are asked to accept not only that a disc reproduced backwards can bring a dead man back to life, but it also contains hidden messages SPECIFICALLY addressed to a child, when the singer had no connection to the child when he was alive, and Of course, there is no way of knowing in which hands the disc would end. Anyway, the movie is fun for a while, but eventually stupidity and uselessness reign. If they were really trying to create a new horror icon similar to Freddy, they were very far away: the villain here has no personality, motivation or variety. (* 1/2)
