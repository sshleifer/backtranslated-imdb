I'm not very interested in The Pallbearer, it's not that bad, but it's very slow at that time. As the film progresses, it becomes a bit more interesting, but nothing bright. I really like David Schwimmer and I think it's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but sometimes I do not care and it's fine here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like leads, then you can enjoy it.
