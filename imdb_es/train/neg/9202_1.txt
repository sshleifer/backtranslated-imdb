I own this movie. Not by choice, I do it. The other day I got bored and the box intrigued me. So I put it on the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life shouting "Why God, why?" The plot was not so bad, as a player, I could appreciate parts of it. I think maybe if you like the romantic scenes of super geeky-cheese, you'll enjoy this movie. "I always considered myself a Vulcan that you know as Dr.Spock ... unable to love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it really is horrible. But if you're in a really bad movie, this is for you! However, the real story is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
