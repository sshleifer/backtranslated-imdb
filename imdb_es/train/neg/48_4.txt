There are some beautiful images in this film, it captures some of the landscapes with such beautiful light, in fact, cinematography is probably your best resource. <br /> <br /> But basically it's more like a movie made for television, and although it has many twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it interesting enough to watch, there are no subtitles and the key developments of the plot are revealed in Spanish, so those who do not speak Spanish will be lost a bit. <br /> <br /> I had it as a Christmas present, as it is a family trait to work on an actor's films that we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was simply amazing in "A Time to kill", and in " The Newton Boys ". I expressed that I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, although he says that the DVD box is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses it as a marketing strategy, it has some lines and is on screen. for not very few minutes at the end of the movie, he is basically an extra and does not illuminate the screen exactly while it is on, so he dies hard fans, although it's not worth it from that point of view. <br /> <br /> Although the movie star, Patrick McGaw is great and very nice to look at, and his character is so kind, friendly and loving, a true saint of a boy, it would be well written in a com. ROM <br /> <br /> So, for the true performance of Mcconaughey from the ones I've seen, I would recommend "A time to kill". The Newton Boys "" Fragility "," How to lose a boy in 10 days "," Edtv "and" Friendship "and also avoid" Larger Than Life "and" Angels in the Outfield "unless you feel like a movie to Children or have children around since none of these are indicative of their talent, but they are quite fun movies for children, again MM is nothing more than a supporting artist with few lines, if any. <br / > <br /> As for Scorpion Springit It's not a bad movie, but it's not screen theft either.
