Wow, I knew this movie was going to be bad but not so bad. Spoilerific comments are produced. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a retired policeman (a cliché!) Sick and sweet, who helps everyone, smiles like a postoperative lobotomy patient and laments his dead son. His adopted son returns from the "Special Operations" of the Armed Forces and because he "sees things," represented by gritting his teeth if someone mentions something about the past. It's time to clean up the streets of another guy who once met Piper and her dead son (whom the bad boy killed) and her adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love interest is a beautiful young woman who decides for No reason for her to want to jump the bones of the ex-army guy. This happens in approximately 2 minutes of 1 scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than the story and the acting. Everything has been done before, everything has been done much better (Ong-Bak is a good example). This is the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (Spelled Wrong for the Americans) and the label line has "from the creators of Bloodsport and Kickboxer": take a look at other films by director David Worths and You will soon realize why they put these 2 movies there, even though they are over 10 years old. Classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - it really says it all. <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you're not going to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> PS: sorry for not knowing the names of the characters, it tells you something.
