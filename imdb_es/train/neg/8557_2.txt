I admire 'Kiss in the mouth' for its frankness? Cutting pubic hair and masturbation, especially from director / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the veracity of the "private" everyday events. Unfortunately, the film is framed in the realm of 'The Brown Bunny', although with a slightly more developed jealous argument. Yes, it reflects "Bunny" with a lot of nothing happening, or too many cinematic shots focused (or sincerely out of focus) on absolutely nothing. Feet, hands or genitals Once again, unfortunately, I can see why this movie was released and why people are renting: real-life sex scenes and frontal nudes (both male and female). Apart from that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learned of a couple of male / female roommates after college, in which the man has obvious feelings for the woman who sees him as a friend while having sex with his ex-boyfriend. Apart from that, we are subject to the daily events of her boring lives: she works for her parents; He works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For all this to work, the dialogue must be interesting and the action real. I do not work, and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, that is, 'The Brown Bunny'. The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she makes a questionable performance. (The extra DVD with her in front of a microphone is really worth watching / listening to). Once again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for having discovered everything and not being afraid to expose themselves or the habits of the shower, but the film falls flat It has narrations that do not fit in the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing performances that one wonders, apart from the soft porn factor, why he rented it.
