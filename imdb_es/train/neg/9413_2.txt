I totally disagree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason why I did not rate him as horrible was the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of their talent for singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the rest of the image. Alice Faye comes out pretty hollow. Don Ameche has a great voice for singing, but with the miserable writing material, it comes out so terribly corny. <br /> <br /> The plot is very rigid here, with Ameche assuming two parts as a song and a dancer and a baron. I'm not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that by playing the song and dancing the man, Ameche's marriage gets a second change to turn on again. Some nonsense nonsense about the fact that the baron has to fix his business and be outside allow him to interpret both parties. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here, so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. The same goes for J. Carrol Naish, who actually feels uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a bomb from the girl in a movie.
