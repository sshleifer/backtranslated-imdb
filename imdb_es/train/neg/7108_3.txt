After seeing the credits with a single name that I recognize and that was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife by convincing other people that she is crazy and will take his own life. The husband knows that the skull of plastic appearance that uses, in contrast, the ghost of a woman, apparently his first dead wife has revenge in his mind and uses a real skull. A simple plot with a touch of irony in the end. If you are tired late one night and need to sleep, this will help you sleep that sleep.
