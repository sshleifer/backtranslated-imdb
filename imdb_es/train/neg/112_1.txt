This movie is just horrible. John Ritter makes previous falls, 75% of the actors deliver their lines as if they were reading from reference cards, a poor edition, a horrible sound mix (the dialogue is difficult to capture in places about the background noise) and a plot that really goes nowhere I never thought I'd say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she was not dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's children are horrible (the oldest is definitely reading his lines on a reference card). This movie is really horrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV ads, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to see you, you'd better find another soul mate. I'd rather get my eyes out with grass darts than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could summarize this movie in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
