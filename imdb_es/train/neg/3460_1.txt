Oh man, does this movie ever bite! If you were ever afraid to see a repetition of the slasher genre, made as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (compatible with PC, it means there are no nudity, a classic element of slasher movies) Cut is that. Each clich√© is retreated without a touch of self-awareness and acting. Oh, the performance redefines the word horror. I should have known better, since the direct translation into Dutch of the title would have warned me.
