Another movie more about a tortured, egocentric, arrogant, hateful, self-destructive main character that is supposed to worry us. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm very open to all kinds of offenses. Wall movies that have as a main character a strongly self-destructive character. What I oppose about this is that there are very few backgrounds for this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script had dealt with this more, they would have been able to get some sympathy for him. As it is, it is shown as a disagreeable hateful character, not tragic, simply hateful. <br /> <br /> After trying hard to make this guy as crazy and antisocial as possible and his destiny is so dark it is possible that the writer has the nerve to make a happy ending ... <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've seen in my life, but it's there putting together a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
