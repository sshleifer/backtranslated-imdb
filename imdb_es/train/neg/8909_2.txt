This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot does not even make sense. Some scientist who works in the limits of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe hell?) And his daughter is sucked or something, then one day, for no apparent reason, she returns and now has big breasts and uses a disguise (I guess the demons in the other dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she's gay, so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they run into this witch. book of spells (do they want to be witches or something?) and the evil spell ends up being read again, which is how the evil demon comes to earth, that only the girl in a bikini and the man despised in love can apparently stop. There are topless scenes without reason and a boy who, as my boyfriend says, is a well-known fighter, but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they invented something just to put it on him because maybe fight fans really see this movie without sense. . I'm sure topless girls do not hurt there either. The additional features of the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it could help explain what was happening, but in reality it only made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a movie of going camping to make a monster fight, but there are a lot of things (like the other dimension and the book seller) that make it confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was like five dollars so big. I do not recommend seeing it, although it was too stupid, I can not think of any part of the movie that was good.
