This movie could have been much better with a script rewrite. Not that he expects a great likelihood in the movies, but one would think that even the homeless and the inhabitants of urban areas, Jack Mason, would wonder why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide. And on reaching the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T does his part as if he were really going to lead these men through forests he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Burns find Thomas Burns in Seattle? ? <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie was based on Richard Connell's story "The most dangerous game". A few years ago, I showed this movie to a class of ninth grade students after reading the story. I reedited the film, eliminating all the meaningless scenes and all the blasphemy. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
