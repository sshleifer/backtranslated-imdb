This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed. The character of Ice Cube is the personification of a black instigator who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the relations between the black and white characters that tried to approach each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to be with my people", that racist comment spoke in the volume. And John, do not think for a minute that the image of Thomas Jefferson on the staircase in the tower did not get my attention. Good touch!
