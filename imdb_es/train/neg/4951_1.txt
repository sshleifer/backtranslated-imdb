I commented on this when he debuted for the first time and gave him a "thumbs in the middle" review, noting that I would give him the benefit of the doubt beyond the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes up to this point in June of 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fan, I can say without hesitation: this show is crap. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong. All. Overcoming only the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously complicated and have no character development or apparent interest on the part of the writers of this dreck to give substance to any story. <br /> <br /> And for the love of God ... is it just me, or is it the Joker in EVERY EPISODE? Is Gotham a revolving door justice system? Or, again, it's just a lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see "there's no character development," above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every Joker The story is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gives people gas. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker intends to gas the entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode that I saw that was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster ... the episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the program of questions and answers. That was the worst Batman story I've seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement". <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I feel that this program is because it is probably against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. It was from Bat-entertainment, from the days of Fox and Kids WB. Such good things, and I should have known this, simply could not have lasted forever, unfortunately.
