A confusing mess from beginning to end. As they used to say about the Beatles songs, there was a secret message if you played the LP upside down. If one had the patience to see the scenes of this film from beginning to end, it would leave with the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Aside from all this psychedelic mixture of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the supporters of the film, looking for revenge if the movie was not solved. There was nothing I liked about these two either. Overexploitation, cries and threats were delivered in the form of comics. I think one-dimensional was an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe the artistic types are rolling their eyes, reveling in the fact that unlike them, commoners did not understand it. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie taken from beginning to end. A non-existent and pathetic storyline if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character that matters in the least.
