I myself am a big fan of the low budget horror films of the 80s. This is not the worst but it is still not spectacular. The plot is decent, but it lasts too long. You have finished half of the movie before you can see any zombie action. The deaths are not very creative and the zombies are not too cunning. I really think that this movie would have been better if they had left the zombies out and turned into a mafia movie. You can see it, but I feel like this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I will give credit to the film for being something original. If you really like horror movies B, it's worth watching them, but if not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for it.
