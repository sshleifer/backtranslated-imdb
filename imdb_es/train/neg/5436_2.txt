A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD from his ass. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled by the perspectives of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels brought me a lot of entertainment and the adaptations prior to the script were great, but hey, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the people who did the casting must have been asleep while they were doing it. I imagine that the castings were something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really enjoy the fish." "I wonder full, you're hired, have some money." <br /> <br /> What's the script? I read Chabon, which I hope has gone blind before I could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why it bothered me the way it did, but it could have something to do with the fact that listening to a 90-year-old drunk duck-hunter with a speech disability with a right cranial-lobe dysfunction would have been a pleasure in comparison with The girls of a killing model of second-grade children spat. <br /> <br /> This is a real movie line; "If you tell me something you've never said out loud to anyone before, this moment becomes unique!" Only? Does he do it? Really? Of course, do not iron. Please, pass me the Imodium. I'll have a whole fucking strip. <br /> <br /> The address is ... good. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just found out that his grandmother exploded or something. Adhere to the direction of comedies. Do not stick to directing commercials. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it left me banging my head against a wall so strong that it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who saw a 1 star movie.
