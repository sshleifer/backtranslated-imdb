Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a group of rabbis who invent crooked machines to bypass Saturday's regulations, it does not really attack Judaism and seems enraged when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that Israel's very creation in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called 'sacred books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and absolute lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film. <br /> <br /> I find it very difficult to believe that man is atheist or even so intelligent. Anyone can approach a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what does he have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he really tell you why he thinks they are stupid. What does the "rational" person do in the room? In a way, it reflects what it really is not and, in the process, it looks as stupid as those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie / documentary about the real evils of religion and how can religion really be harmful to human civilization, see "The root of all evil?" by Richard Dawkins. It is a brilliantly researched documentary that clearly describes what is expected to be achieved and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's Religion is not funny, does not raise interesting questions or provide any information on such a controversial subject. It seems to be the dispossession and ravings of an old man dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I almost feel sorry for him.
