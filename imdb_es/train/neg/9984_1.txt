It was Sunday night and I was waiting for the movie announced on television. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, after those 30 minutes and I did not laugh even once. The fact is that the movie ended and I did not even start laughing. PLEASE, someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
