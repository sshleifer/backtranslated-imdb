If the team behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twisted Finish" movie, it is not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH ON THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the turns, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you produced this with little energy and, to be fair, did miracles with your budget but, please, hire people who can act. Or at least, walking, talking and gesturing at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm watching you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're going to set up a part of your film in the past, just do this if you have the accessories and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. The twisted ends are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we do not want turns that do not make sense, but signal the "revelation" as soon as you introduce a character? That is not a great idea. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I prefer that they have not ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie completistas.
