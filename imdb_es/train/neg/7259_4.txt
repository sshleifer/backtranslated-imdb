This is definitely one of the rarest movies of the 70s, and is most notable for kicking off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also notable for the little touches of madness throughout the film, especially when the dark half and in a bad mood is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDATION of all things (as pointed out by another user, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles in a canoe for a while, then ... he leaves, never to be seen again). Even though it's painfully dated now, I'm still a fun scary movie to show the kids, and anyone who enjoys the Bigfoot culture or the 70's culture of Hillbilly is destined to take advantage of it. My favorite part: a boy gets so scared that he jumps headlong through a door (!?) And the narrator explains that he was knocked unconscious by the "shock". Uh, I would say that breaking a door with your head is more likely why you became unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like Americana.
