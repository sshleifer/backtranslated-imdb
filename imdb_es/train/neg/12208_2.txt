As an army veteran, this film deeply offended me. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers that I knew were offended by this shit is an understatement. If the film were presented as a satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously by my people, especially abroad. Foolish as it sounds, wherever I went to Europe in the late 1980s, people seemed to judge me and the Americans in general for this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A cretin, monosyllabic and muscular, is removed from a prison labor gang to go on a secret mission to Southeast Asia to free some American prisoners of war. In a running battle, he kills some 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never overheats. And it never fails, running with a 32-pound gun held up with one arm. I could go on, but my head hurts. I gave this to 2/10 just because it's a little better than Rambo III.
