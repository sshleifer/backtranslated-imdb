Tony Scott destroys anything that might have been interesting in the clich√©, patched and exaggerated script of Richard Kelly. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who left and became a bounty hunter. This is his story ... "a kind of". <br /> <br /> The problem with this crap is that there is not much history at all and the extreme graphic stylization of each shot of Scott acts as a distancing mechanism. that makes us indifferent to everything in the chaotic life of Harvey. <br /> <br /> You do not care about Harvey. Knightley interprets her as an odious and cynical brat who has done nothing to guarantee our respect. He hits people he does not like and gets rid of his clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but it's not real at all and Knightly is not convincing either. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It's noisy, too, and chained with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes are a bad repeat of Scott's "True Romance" climax with the Domino gang that will meet with two groups of fiefs that are: surprise! surprise! - destined to shoot among them at the top of a Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally damaged by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious and pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; It is a failure at all levels because it does not give us a point of entry into the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a rogue bounty hunter, but disappears in the background as the "Narrative" progresses. Chris Walken presents another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the surface of this layer of multiple layers and with many tricks. It still sucks, no matter how hard you polish it.
