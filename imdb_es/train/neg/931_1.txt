I can not believe that this piece of written and directed wood clich√© has been made. There are about four good looking shots (the director should think about switching to still photography) and that's it. A strong cast is completely wasted, the scenes end repeatedly in the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new. Please, save this movie.
