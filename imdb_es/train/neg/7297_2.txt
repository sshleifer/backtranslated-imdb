Because of the dialogue and the initial scenes, I knew that I knew that a train collision was waiting for me. I did not want to look, but I could not get away. If it were not for the sweet eye of this movie, I would have given a star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the behavior of the relationship was so remote, coupled with a bad direction and a horrible story, make this movie nothing more than a low budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. But this movie fails so horribly that there was no opportunity to bounce. <br /> <br /> If you were stuck in the forest, your best childhood friend died of an unknown disease, other friends died around you, trapped in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Have sex with the girlfriend of your friends. C.) Take a warm bath to relax your pains and include shaving your legs. D.) Hit the head of your best friend of your childhood and the crush of a lifetime with a shovel. E.) All the previous ones. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so preposterous. In fact, they are all plausible and well represented in cabin fever. The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throw this film in the bin of your local rental store. Keep away. stay away
