Mona la vagabunda lives on the margins of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I watched it because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I must have missed something. Mona's character has little or no personality as she deviates through life being rude to people, taking drugs and not contributing to anyone's life. She is not interesting or exciting. She is simply useless. <br /> <br /> I have seen and met enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they are doing. They are just lazy tramps. I would not want Mona to be near me, since she tends to steal anything that is not nailed and leave her friends in the lurch. Of course it is enigmatic, because there is nothing for her. Many of the drug addicts, winos and vagabonds that I have seen are enigmatic; I would not like to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> There may be something there that I missed. Otherwise, I assume that all the reviews are from people who assume that anything made by a French director is a great art.
