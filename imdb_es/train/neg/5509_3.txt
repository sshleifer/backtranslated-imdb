When I was a kid in the 50s and 60s, everything about Disney was great by definition. What happened? They are able to get any actor and actress they want, the best of their time. But somehow, Disney manages to ruin things despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they ruin things! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in its arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It's only due to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 out of 10.
