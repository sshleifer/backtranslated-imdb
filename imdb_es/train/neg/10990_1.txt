I ended up watching this whole movie (very long) because I was fascinated by the stupidity and naivety of it. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would have participated voluntarily in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people really were * so * naive? The plot seems written by a confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a conflict of superpowers and the Russians are really the good guys. The general secretary of the Communist Party is a kind and spiritual man who, suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels obliged to alleviate his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner. Priest of a Siberian gulag. The priest then quickly becomes the Pope through a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret process of papal voting in the Vatican that is presented in the most pious way you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of half their death. country to death. To solve this little hiccup in the relentless shining path towards communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to distribute Western capitalist riches with justice to China's poor workers). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade general The secretary cares a little and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to negotiate peace. They meet with the Chinese leader, Comrade Peng, who looks and acts like a 15-year-old boy. You will roll on the floor laughing at what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like. Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay (which is quite logical after all, do not the capitalists have to pay the madness of the Socialists?), And that the Pope must also sacrifice something for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> Then, when the Pope crowns in Rome, he promises all the wealth of the Catholic Church around the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And so it saves the world from the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, there are also some minor subplots, which, unfortunately, provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give you three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn seems unlikely as Pope. It is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek.
