One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into saps for a spoiled child. Both have sold in this, worse than the character of Pryor. Two: Horrible, a too sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie is so clich√©. Three: Choice of a black actor as the toy; The racial subtext of this is unbearable, since it was never addressed. There is no message here, the role of Pryor could have been played by any comic actor. Four: that boy ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from acting ... that would mean that films like this and Kid Co. had not been made ... and my childhood would have been free of its power to distort the mind. So, if you want to see a couple of great comics that are profaned in a sickly and sweet children's movie, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, look at the old act of Pryor and Gleason standing on something better, like the newlyweds.
