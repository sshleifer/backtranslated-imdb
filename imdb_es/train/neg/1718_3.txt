I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, since their costumes and stores reflect the real photographs of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche in mourning for her dying husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and our antiheroes remain pretty much to the end, even after being shot through holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before her famous ambush, and she it seemed to her). a cheerful cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is bad, particularly the tracks. Very disappointing. Stay with Beatty and Dunaway. It may not be "the real story", but it's a great movie.
