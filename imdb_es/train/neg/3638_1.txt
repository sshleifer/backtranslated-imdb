The film portrays the unresolved problems of France with its colonial legacy in West Africa (French-speaking) through the confusing and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (who symbolically represents her nation here). It is an often attractive and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to accept a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and the desire of a nation to reach the "other" that was once "owned" and molded. This is reflected in the way it focuses entirely around the idea of ​​traveling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; We remember realities of undeniable contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> All the characters play a symbolic role, although limited and unconvincing. France, which is supposed to be a visual and totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her difficult situation, since it seems that she is still imbued with the same naivethat she enjoyed as a child, in fact, as a child she seems more in possession of his reality. The rest of the rag-tag set is simply forgettable. Black Africans are, at the very least, impressionist portraits of the former colonized peoples who are now colonized by the mismanagement of their material by the director. They are nothing more than a dark and dying backdrop against which France resembles a blythe looking for a world that he never knew and which awaits one that can never be found in Cameroon.
