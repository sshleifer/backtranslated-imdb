DARK REMAINS is a low-budget American horror film that somehow managed to win 2 prizes. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve 2 separate chapters. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer finds her throat cut. The bereaved couple decides to move to a secluded cabin in the mountains. Later it is seen that the cabin and the surrounding locations are enchanted. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the two separate lines of the story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is random and results in a confusion that may only be solved by multiple visualizations. Unfortunately, the film is simply not attractive enough to attract the majority of viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong, and fast! And the low budget can not be used to justify all the deficiencies found here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production since the material was simply too poor. <Br /> <br /> The characters are not interesting as noted by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script presents too many people without giving them an interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for situations guided by the character and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The address is not inspired. The inspiration for the J-Horror films like RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay much attention to the J-Horror style. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays with fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant changes between a strange situation (a ghost in a CCTV camera walking towards it, for example) and the reaction of a central character who confronts her without warning. There is no humor or ironic element in these movies. Everything is played so directly and without remorse or limitations that you can not help being convinced and captivated by it. The environments present the suspense and assure that the horror has a psychological impact, very different from the "jump fears" that are used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The directors of DARK REMAINS made a valiant attempt to avoid Hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided the use of CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well-intentioned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed "fears" on the screen. The makeup effects of the "ghosts" were not so bad given the low budget, but their actions only challenged the logic. I was scratching my head several times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not reveal the ending, even if I wanted to. I just could not understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something like an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What is left? The answer that a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a task to sit down. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably be disconnected long before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things I could find in this movie: to successfully avoid the clichés of fear and the absence of the "word f" in each individual sentence as one would expect to find. This is what the 2 stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who like the supernatural or psychological horror related to ghosts and ghosts can do well in movies like THE LEGEND OF HELL, THE CHANGE or the J- Subgenre of terror. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure, ultra-rated "R" horror movie about ghosts, look at DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the best horror movie ever made, but it's probably much better than DARK REMAINS and it has some genuine surprises in store. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid the DARK REMAINS as the plague.
