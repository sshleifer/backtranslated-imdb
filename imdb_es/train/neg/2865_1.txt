In general, I do not do less and if this site could give this movie -3 out of 10 it means that I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll alone in the dark was the worst I've seen so far, but at least I gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff did not shoot at all and made me laugh, so I improved the ratings a little). Hell, if it were compared to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best movie if they were competing. <br /> <br /> Now, in the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer, which is fine, but they could have done it better. The start looked good, but that's what I had to overtake most because death is boring. I like killer movies and even if they stink they could get some great deaths. I'm not an expert in fantasy movies, but believe me it would have shot if I had seen this. I'm sorry for rambling, but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and filmed this ... this ... disaster thing. Uwe Boll, your movies are no longer on my list of the worst movies that took the cake. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm sorry, I could not explain the plot (if any) but it was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind, I'm going to crawl into a corner and move from one place to another to remind me how bad this movie scared me for life ... It's okay, not for life.
