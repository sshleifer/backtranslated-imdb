The model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of his sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is taken to trial but goes completely free. Then he rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Objectionable and ill rape movie. This movie was announced as an important drama about rape. What it is is a badly written drama and (for the most part) badly performed. He pretends to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape, but pushes the scene in our face. However, to be totally honest, Hemingway's performance is so bad in that sequence that he loses any real impact he may have had. The test scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie went too far when they raped Mariel, 15 years old (fortunately she did not see herself). I admit that it did lead to a grand finale when Margaux takes a gun and shoots Sarandon to death. But seriously, having a raped girl is simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and a real model, I think), but her acting left a lot to be desired. Decrease the movie Mariel was fine, but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. It was not bad, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that in a screening of this in 1976, some women stood up and applauded when they killed Sarandon, so maybe this will work for some. people. I found this boring, simplistic and REALLY sick. A 1 all the way.
