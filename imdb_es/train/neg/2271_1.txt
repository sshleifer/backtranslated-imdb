Probably someone could make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version simply manages to drain everything authentic and interesting from the garbage phenomenon. There are dozens of famously bad movies (for example, "Hands: The Hands of Destiny") that show more creativity and spirit than this sad and wasteful movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about Jerry? Springer Show, which would begin to answer some of the real questions like: Who are these people? What happens with their lives after they appear in this program? How was the mayor of Cincinatti found here? <br /> <br /> A good line: during an "orientation" session for guests: "People, I can not emphasize this enough: NO WEAPONS!"
