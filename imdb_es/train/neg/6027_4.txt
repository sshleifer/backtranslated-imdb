I grew up as a Baptist and I know the story that this movie tries to tell, although I no longer believe in the story. I will congratulate the film for being as good as the average movie of a lifetime of the week. Slightly interesting, mediocre performance, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is cheerful and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have to be the people who are not clean and squeaky Christians, ever. Not a single curse from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor who plays the man who heads the United Nations declared "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler," just like Bush. Is there any Christian code of honor that orders that, since Bush also claims that he is also called by God, that all Christians must hide their ignorance by mispronouncing that word in the same way as he does? Haha I really had a hard time taking the movie seriously after that. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the film began to feel like packaged and manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for meaningless entertainment, stop here, it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you look for intelligence, look elsewhere.
