Definitely the worst movie I've seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should have laughed? There is not a single clue or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are pestilent, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who can not do a Sicilian accent. I do not want to say about the dream insertion about Dracula ... just another resource, extracted from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "film" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this supposed film was too difficult to rescue. I would have given it "0" / 10, but the lowest rating was 1/10, so I had to overestimate it for a brand.
