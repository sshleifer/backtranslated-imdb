Flat characters that do not interest you and that you will never mind. Criminant dialogue in some places. There are no turns (they think they have one, but if you did not solve it after about 40 minutes, you are not too smart). Many well-known actors in roles and performances that, fortunately for all involved, will be forgotten as soon as the final credits begin. <br /> <br /> I do not care about "slow" movies, but they have been going somewhere. This one does not. <br /> <br /> The plot was not what made this a direct DVD movie, but rather a convenient excuse to try to generate some false controversy. <br /> <br /> The as-of-writing 37 (!) ten (10) qualifications must be from people involved in the production.
