Unknowingly, I had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to watch it; although I did not expect much. When the credits begin, I am surprised to discover that this film was made under the Filmirage company. Filmirage brought to the world such incredible things as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I was forced to see. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, it had Potential to be pretty decent, even if it was not original. The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the rhythm began to creep and I found myself thinking: "Well, better kill someone soon" or "Someone better mute". At the beginning of this drag, when I was having these thoughts, although someone could have died or mutated, however, as noted, the blood and effects were not very good. What made things worse was that the transitions of the scene were confusing; Example: first, Dr. Houseman would be at the zoo, then he would have a sudden response about the possibility of killing someone, finally he would wake up with a cold sweat on the bed, causing the audience to ask "Was I dreaming that I was in? the zoo?". Like the pace of the movie, these transitions from the scene progressively worsened. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that the development of Dr. Houseman's character was quite good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once 'I've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into, with luck you will laugh, what really is the only reason to see this movie at least once; This film is unintentionally executed as a long-winded joke. <br /> <br /> The suit of the um, something that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "Search for the mighty sword", which took place in the same year. You have to love Filmirage's films, they're always reusing the same things!
