The idea behind this movie was good. Too bad it was not well written. Choosing Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an excellent job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been excellent, and she even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really disappointed us by making her role a defenseless woman. This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character that was supposed to be. I do not care about Alley's performance anyway. The movie should have finished about fifteen minutes earlier than it did. The director milked the cow to dry before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier's performances.
