This movie was exaggerated. Many of the viewers, who thought this was "unbelievable" must have been in the old school movies, because the whole movie is set in the past. At first, I thought that the film only showed something of the past, so I expected the dream to pass as the lighting of the characters, but it just went. Basically, this was a movie that tried to mix the future with the past, and the 2 does not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could see the blue screen with which the actors worked. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no reason for critics to exaggerate this movie by saying that "it's the best movie ever made." It sucks on a stick. It also did not help that the story line was so bad. I do not understand why Hollywood accepted that this film was produced, and I do not understand how the actors / actresses of this film are willing to participate in a movie like this one. It's almost as if everyone read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on a computer." This was a movie that should have been in a movie network, because nothing in this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
