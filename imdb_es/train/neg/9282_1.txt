This movie is unworthy of the Omen title. It is so bad that it has actually damaged the classical nature of the first three. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They do not even write the NAME of Damien Thorn correctly !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen's films. Remove it from the shelves and burn it.
