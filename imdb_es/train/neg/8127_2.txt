Currently, this movie appears on the IMDb list as the 42nd worst movie ever made, which explains exactly why I rented it to NetFlix. However, I am sad to report that the film, while bad, is not bad enough to merit being on the list of the 100 most important films. Personally I have seen at least 100 movies worse than this one. Hardly a brilliant backup, but it just did not reach the expected level of horror to be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their late honeymoon (by the way, they're married in real life too). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (seal of a bad movie) and soon they are bitten by a bat. According to this movie, bats love attacking people and there are vampires in the US. UU., Both are not entirely true. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, after being bitten, the man does not even bother going to the hospital !! The first thing in the mind of anyone (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this one. Soon, he is having seizures, and even then, STILL does not care to seek help! Again and again you still think that this must be the stupidest couple in the history of cinema! <br /> <br /> After a while, he finally goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But, by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he starts killing people to suck their blood. When it is totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit as a brain) refuses to believe that it is dangerous, even after she attacks people, steals an ambulance and run a police car out of the way! <br /> <br /> Now, most of the time, Moss is going through these episodes, his eyes are turned back and he looks like a normal person. Curiously, however, a couple of times he develops hands like bats and towards the end used some nice prostheses on him to make him look pretty much like a bat. If this had been really cheesy, the film would have deserved a 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a twist that barely made sense, the wife inexplicably became a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats They kill the evil sheriff. The way this was organized was a mystery, as was the belief of Moss and McAndrew that this movie would somehow help their careers, although both have had reasonably long careers on television since 1974. <br /> <br /> In general, very silly. The plot is silly and does not make sense and relies heavily on people acting too stupid to be real. It's not a good movie at all, but it's not among the worst movies of all time either. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the graphic of the three DVDs for IT'S ALIVE and its two sequels. Website of THE BAT PEOPLE. Although THE BAT PEOPLE has been titled "It's Alive", the two films are not related at all. It's easy to understand the error, especially since they came out in 1974, but the movie I just reviewed was starring Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
