What the reviewers and MST3K have omitted is the best part (and the only memorable scene) of this otherwise terrible movie: There is a very good rape scene in the shower committed by the bad boy (Ben Gazzara, look-alike) in Maria (as mentioned, killed later by TJ's ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, "mating ritual in prison" may be more appropriate. The background behind this opportunity, however, the forced encounter is the gangster who is hiding "Ben Gazzara", he introduces him to the girls who are in his pool. The 30-year-old blonde dislikes him, but our villain must be quite beaten by her, because the courtship is at that moment. His first movement is to try to drown her, until his mafia, don benefactor, tells him to finish it. Something like the girl in high school that you did not like, but still wanted to have a carnal knowledge anyway ... Let's say he meets her in the cabin later.
