A particularly defamed example of Italian cult cinema with an absurd start-up title (in any case, the alternative brand of Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica ) only Do you create a flat environment in everything? actually matched by the handling that is downright terrible! Here, we have the usual group of people (a company of actors) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a Count, since he had fallen in love with the protagonist, a dead singer for his missing wife). The characters are quite stereotypes: middle-aged but hurried hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history has more than his share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, perverted companion (remembering Mae West and emerging the most annoying of many !), a scenic and devoted stage director (always reprimanded by each and every one for his non-masculine behavior!), a pair of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, takes action, if I know what I mean), an envious housewife (however, the nominal star Femi Benussi, for its value, this is really a piece of set), a religious fan of a butler, an impressionable waitress, etc. Although the film is not for nothing, it means indisputable, the atrocious dubbing, the rhythm of the snails, the production of bad quality (with the scenes that represent the furious sea raised from a film in black and white!) And the fact of that the murders only occur within the final half hour does not help. In addition, Marcello Giombini's score, although pleasant in itself, is incongruously modern in these circumstances; That said, the revelation is surprisingly elaborate (considering that here surely there is no shortage of suspects).
