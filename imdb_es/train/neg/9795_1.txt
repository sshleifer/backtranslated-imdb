Come on, what's the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always felt that the program, which was originally brought from Japan in a better way, took what was great in Japan and became one of the most ridiculous and useless excuses in the history of toy marketing! There is absolutely no point with this show. <br /> <br /> Bad haircuts, bad disguises, earrings, etc., show what was ridiculous in the 1990s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the "Duhs", the Main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney. I bought the rights to this program about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to endure the repetitions of this program on the Disney channel and so on. <br /> <br /> All I can say one more time Give me a break!
