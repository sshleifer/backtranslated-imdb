We all know what it is like when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this comedy of Neil Simon analyzes how it is when you have the worst of every day trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it's just not worth going, you know what I mean? And sometimes, it's just not worth doing when it was done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better too. <br /> <br /> It's not that Steve Martin is such a bad comedian or wrong for the role of a harassed and stressed advertising executive; on the contrary, in both aspects. And, it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept; her work has always been good, if not excellent, since I first saw her on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In television in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it does not it's about the unfortunate couple at all: is it really about New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives in conjugal happiness? kind of ?? In the largest city in the world. That's if you're a New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you travel somewhere and includes most of Situations and visual gags you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. Unfortunately, this 1999 version becomes free tangents specifically for an audience these days who expect or want to see the excess. For example, not happy with the stellar appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (also relatively long) of Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Giuliani looking for president even then? Worse? A traveling talking ad for the kinder face of New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, repeating his role as Basil Fawlty? But this time, like a transvestite who also jumps? Once again he surprised the hotel staff, sucking the rich clients and, in general, making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role. And, in the process, causing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, possibly the best series of British comedy, without exception ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. I was almost literally bankrupt. Then, when it was made in 1970, that was the city you saw: dark, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all ). By 1999, things had improved: the ostentation had returned, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready for you to bite, if you had the moxie ... <br /> <br /> So, naturally, the Couple in this second coming finds moxie within herself and finally joins the fabulous struggle to continue the American dream of life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Therefore, this movie is really funny, but not for reasons that the producers might have foreseen. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy, this movie is a parody of the best done with the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter, then definitely do not bother with this.
