"It seems that many critics consider the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama disagreeable." And for good reason: they are unbearable wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And make no mistake: most critics supported Allen's claims about Bergman, despite Allen's complaints of complaints. What I do not understand is this: why Allen was generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporary Brian DePalma was condemned for "swindling" Hitchcock in his suspense / horror films? In Robin Wood's opinion, it is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree with that.
