The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes a funny thing, and that it was an appropriate time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters. This is the kind of movie that is so sweet that it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get terribly tedious when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two drivers are not together on the screen, this really is not bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to each other.
