Just torture. <br /> <br /> I'd rather see 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than see this dazed fool again. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. <br /> <br /> You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here only ONLY are the holes, and the emotion factor? Well, that makes dry paint an adrenaline rush and an Olympic speed sport. <br /> <br /> My brain hurts when I try to find out who accepted this nonsense, did you think about the premise?

Made for television should not be synonymous with: "Sure, let the horses run around the living rooms! Our audience is idiots!" <br /> <br /> I was hooked just to know how it could get worse. . This is not a good sign, folks. <br /> <br /> Hallmark should be ashamed to have launched it. <br /> <br /> I should be ashamed to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed. I'm going for a long shower.
