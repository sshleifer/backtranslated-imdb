I just rented this today ... I heard many good reviews in advance. WOW!! What a lot of smoking poop this movie is !! Does anyone know the director's address so he can recover my five dollars? Finally, someone hit "Stop-loss" from the number one spot in the "worst movie of the Iraq war". To be fair, I do not think there are any good movies from the Iraq war anyway, but this was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not have any technical inaccuracies, there are hundreds of comments from other GWOT veterans that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowest E-nothing about technical accuracy, they could have made the film somewhat realistic ... maybe. I guess the writer should be given "credit" for this waste of a movie. He or she, obviously, plotted the plot of this film from a vivid imagination not afflicted by the constraints of reality. Does anyone other than me wonder what was the point of this movie? Was there a message? Seriously, though ... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am really surprised of all the positive reviews really. This film is difficult to see as a veterinarian due to all the obvious inaccuracies, but even if one could overlook that, the plot stinks, the characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is bad at best. cases. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about the Explosive Ordinance Disposition, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
