I can not stand most reality shows and this one is worse than Paris Hilton, and I'm sure it's their company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired," for how many seasons now? After watching the program, I would not want to work for the guy with his ego and everything, and I think that seeing the dry painting has more entertainment valve. <br /> <br /> I would love to hear a person get up and say "Donald, I quit, I take part of your money and I buy a decent hairstyle". I see that he is even trying to buy fame in the WWE fight. I hope he hurts himself so he does not have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and not have talent and make you an ass trying to buy it. If you could, you would give a negative note to this program, but you get a 1 and you do not deserve it.
