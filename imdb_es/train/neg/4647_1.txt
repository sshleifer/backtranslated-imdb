Half of the reviews were good, so I took a risk for $ 10. Of course Priscilla Barnes had some sexual conversation but it was not much. The whole plot after she can be the other actress, the mother and the documentary maker who falls in love with the young woman, is stretching it. It's not funny, it's not that aggressive, it's not much more than a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry, this is not based on anything that has happened in the industry. You might have been surprised at what is popular today in adult movies that make fun of today's gonzo videos and the big orgy that took 5 minutes to film what is a joke: a bigger orgy got bigger and better decades ago at the beginning of the seventies.
