"A trio of treasure hunters are looking for a hidden fortune in the West Indies.The attractiveness of gold increases the tension as men approach the location of the treasure.Deepwater divers hope to track the gold, but find that greed and hatred lead to murder ", according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. "Manfish" is the name of your ship, not a monster. The skeleton that gives the muscular Captain John Bromfield (like Brannigan) his half of the treasure map is very good. The ancient salt Victor Jory (as a teacher) provides the other half of the map. The first couple, Lon Chaney Jr. (as Swedish) plays the fool, and the sexy Tessa Prendergast (as Alita) keeps the rum (not very well, obviously). The serious problems of editing and continuity affect the image, which otherwise could have been something. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
