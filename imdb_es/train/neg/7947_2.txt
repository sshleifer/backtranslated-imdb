When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it was not. I have no idea how this film was allowed to appear on that site. FearNet is a site that shows terrifying horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful of all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a parchment with a stamp stamped on it. He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans become extinct, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Many of the things he did did not make sense. Like when he sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, it is the date when she is expected to give birth to her baby and she begins to go crazy and begins to investigate and ask the religious people what it means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler alert * <br /> <The two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God had told him to kill his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul to her. br /> <br /> This is what happens. The person with mental retardation is shot and dies and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her son. She touches her son's head, transferring her soul to the child and then dies. Then, the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? Do you get angry when the Governor allows the execution of a man with mental retardation and then it is about forgiveness once a solitary woman transfers her soul to her baby? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. It is another religious end of world propaganda. The performance of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. That's all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good acting with lots of nonsense!
