The genre of volleyball is strangely ignored by most screenwriters. Fortunately, acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (with a rating lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, do not let the cover of this movie decide you. Kill Shot stars the next star Koji as a modern Sherlock Holmes. By using high-tech gadgets like a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji can help FBI agents track down a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including brief appearances by Denise Richards, a gay black and a ridiculously ugly and annoying girl, Koji takes this film on his own. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
