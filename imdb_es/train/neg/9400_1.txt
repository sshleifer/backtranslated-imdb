It is very unfortunate when a movie like this one is made. A lot of work and money has been invested in a film that is, at best, amateur. <br /> <br /> The editing is prolonged, there are obvious errors that could have been easily corrected in a second shot, and the soundtrack is unimaginative. You could have done a lot more with this video movie. I guess they ran out of time or videotapes. <br /> <br /> Handheld shots have a different amateur feel.
