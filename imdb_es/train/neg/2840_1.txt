Two old friends are sent to Japan to get the results of a genetic investigation that contains a video, which was stolen by black suit ninjas at the beginning of the film. First, they only have to learn some ninja skill, because "only the ninja can defeat the ninja". <br /> <br /> Sakura's killers strive to be a nice ninja movie, but it fails so badly. The whole movie is so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say anything good about it: the same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, the characters are too briefly drawn, the direction is boring and the script does not offer anything surprising. even in the final scene, which by itself reduces the value of the movie (garbage). <br /> <br /> Even the ninja fan of 80, who understands the aesthetics of junk movies, it's hard to find this movie just pleasant. . It simply does not offer anything new to the viewer, neither in the visual level nor in the plot. The shurikens are thrown and the katanas swing, but it is not enough to direct the direction of the film, but similar combat scenes are repeated, even the most insensitive spectators after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recommend film for anyone. Even the awkward performance of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind the American ninjas of Sakura Killer. Even at the visual level, the movie does not have any balls and it is a waste of time to try to find great fighting scenes in this movie: There is not any. All in all, one of the most useless ninja movies I've seen. He is not even interested in curiosity. Trust me in this case. <br /> <br /> Â½ out of 10.
