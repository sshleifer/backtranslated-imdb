There is no need to detail what others have written in other reviews: here's the summary: <br /> <br /> * Much of the animation work nested is really great. The colors are excellent. I would love it to be done on silk like a tie. <br /> <br /> * History and execution are a total nap. It was quite difficult to stay awake sometimes. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of fine arts, medieval calligraphy, early religion and so on - take on it. This is a MOVIE for you. <br /> <br /> If you want an attractive and entertaining MOVIE, look elsewhere, this is a failure and not an artistic statement. <br /> <br /> The Vikings did not. I do not have horns by the way ...
