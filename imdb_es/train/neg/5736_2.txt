This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years! You could randomly start 5 people off the street and they could act better than anyone else in this movie. Absolute waste of time looking at it. I only gave him a 2 since I like bloody movies, but this is just nonsense. The performance (and I use that term VERY loose) is abysmal, someone, please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first movie. Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was a better movie in some way. I can not believe that someone has spent money doing this, I hope that for the producers it only costs $ 50,000, it seems a school project, made by children who have no idea. Did this even reach the cinema?
