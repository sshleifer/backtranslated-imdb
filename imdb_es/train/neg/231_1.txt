This starts off badly, with the three women acting like nice high school kids sitting around laughing with their gin, endless cigarettes and a chocolate candy with caramel for which tells the best story of "men", and then it gets worse. - spoiler alert = - = with the character of Andie falling in love with the young organist who used to be his student when he was 14 (she is the director of an English school, believe it or not), only to destroy it thanks to her bitch - from the hell 'girlfriend'. ... and then from there, it's basically an indescribable trap: she forgives her "friend" and has the beloved daughter of the organ player and the 3 women finish when they start, drink more gin and smoke more cigarettes, bla , BLA bla. The character of Andie throws the candy chocolates on the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have compassion
