I can almost understand why some people want to emphasize the link of this movie with the eighties, but I really would not say that it is an accurate description of most people's lives at that time, even in Bradford's poorest properties. However, it is typical of the blunt garbage that the beloved Royal Court Theater was producing at that time. A lot of 'right' art for small and small audiences, but enough well-connected backslapping to guarantee future commissions for turgid copyrights. The simple fact is that if you want to reflect on a more common experience, you will find millions more people nodding their heads to know that they agree to love and live as shown in "Gregory's Girl." <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call this a "kitchen sink" drama but that would be a great detriment to the plumbing industry. However, when it comes to having a decent script, this movie is completely destroyed. For some reason, he has accumulated a strange number of followers among Guardians who read to moviegoers, I can only assume that they have a visual chill when pretending they are going to be left out. Directing to clear my friends. It is a poor film with a poor script that likes to think that it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous ideas to the grim life on the farms. It's not ... but it's grim. Do the washing in its place.
