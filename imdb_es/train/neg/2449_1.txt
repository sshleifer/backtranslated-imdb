Bashki must be congratulated for trying to turn one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then being slapped by this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters seemed ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly loud, and the movie was a rickety bombardment in the first and a half book of Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my great disappointment and dislike for the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to turn a book into a film can fail in many ways, simply by the medium, but this film, regardless of the source of the story, is simply pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
