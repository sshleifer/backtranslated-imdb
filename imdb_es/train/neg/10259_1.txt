I saw this movie in the theater when I was a child and I always remember it as my first experience with a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but then I discovered that I had all the explosions or "special effects" in the whole movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the movie. There was some kind of argument related to the aliens, but the aliens were never shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was obvious that it was someone who was making money with a cheap movie designed to defraud people. I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I discovered that there were bad people who made bad movies.
