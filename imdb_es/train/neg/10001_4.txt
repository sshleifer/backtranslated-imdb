This film lacked something that I could not identify at the beginning: the charisma of the main actress. This inevitably resulted in a lack of chemistry when he shared the screen with his protagonist. Even the romantic scenes seemed to be simply the actors at play. It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But could it have been the script? Exactly whose chef was he in love with? He seemed more in love with his culinary skills and his restaurant, and ultimately, with himself and his youthful exploits, than with anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But, do not forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
