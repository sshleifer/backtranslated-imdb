I regret to report that I have seen this movie several times. When it bombed at the box office, it was repeated every night for about a month on HBO. And I saw it again and again because television in general is so bad, or it was at that time. I no longer look, so it could be wonderful now, as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs: "I may have a taste of sweet potato pie, but I'll never know because I would not eat dirty meat." Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration came from for this. The few slightly amusing fragments last too long until you simply close your eyes and clench your teeth. There is a scene in which Arthur and Dom Deluise are in the desert, both dragged and dried, dying of thirst. Then they are known as old acquaintances who do not really know each other very well, they promise to make lunch. It could have been fun. <br /> <br /> But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with the pharaoh in which Pharaoh is a black child of the street made with all the vestments of King Tut. He must have read the lines in a straight line because at some point before the release, they doubled their scene with the Hollywood equivalent of black street slang expressed by an aspiring Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or it could have been Jimmy Walker, who knows? Who cares. They managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, ungraceful, very long excrement, one of those legendary things that just will not undress, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it for someone else. to deal with. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my criticism. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY IT, WHAT YOU DO!), Get ready with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that Poseiden's Adventure has been remade, this one is probably high on the remake list. Maybe they hire a comedy writer this time.
