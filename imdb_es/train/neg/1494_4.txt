Yes, definitely better than my Death Tunnel visualization. Actually, some of the deaths were quite original and the blood was decent. It was something like that Wrong Turn meets Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When the "kids" (high school or college?) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen, everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream ( nineteen ninety six). What happens with girls with big breasts, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Steve was not a pirate Randy de Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell did the movie have to do with Samhain? Quite unnecessary if you ask me. It seems comical when I see those horror films of the 80s that explain the loose ends pointing fingers to the druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ As a reference by Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why were Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters that have nothing to do with anything. And is he so psychic that he could not even see his OWN death? 6.) When Gary was being murdered in the bathroom (at that time, the deaths simply became a Troma craze) how could he hear the screaming when he was down but not listen to them when he was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis, which is mainly a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So, the lesson is if you are like Shae and do not have fun or smile. The whole movie, will you be the one who lives? 9.) The mutants were great, but they looked like chili con carne dishes. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve had been tied up there and they were wondering where? he was? 11.) There was not more than one murderer? Shae beat that, but she never met them again. <br /> <br /> 12.) What happened to the flashbacks for those other people? Half of them, Shae, did not know if they were dead or alive, so what was wrong with that? 13.) Why did not they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why did not anyone call the police? And apparently, everyone KNEW that these people lived in the forest, why they never organized some kind of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires, so how could she "become" one in the end? I'm with everyone else in the giant "huh?" in the end. <br /> <br /> Much better than the death tunnel, but still quite careless. I still do not understand why they even placed it IN Ireland, considering that Samhain had nothing to do with the plot.
