Well, I know that many people will probably resent this review, since Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this movie for the first time at the tender age of 18 years, I must admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister had read the book and had enjoyed it so much, and many people who were whimpering with the same words "Watership Down", their memories of seeing the movie as Children and having their torn emotions at the seams- they recommended it. To be honest, I wish I had not bothered. I gave him the benefit of the doubt; In general I do not like to stop watching a movie in half. This was an exception. It was really, really, unbearably, unbearably boring. This movie was possibly the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a snail doped in space), and it really did not "do" it for me. The art was fine; the backgrounds were well done, although not a bit soft, but the rabbits themselves were not very attractive and the animation was quite striking and was poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go into great details about the story; Basically it is the story of a group of rabbits that leave their lakes due to the infiltration of humans in the area. In general, a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions on the environment uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. For me, I would have liked them to be gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, boring and generally quite rude (oh, I'm so terribly English). I discovered that he was constantly looking at the clock while watching the movie, and it took about 20 minutes or so before something happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I were to praise In any way, I must admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the field and, hopefully, revealing the arrogance of humans, etc., is pretty good intention. Maybe everything is generally sagacious and preacher, but the message you are trying to convey is good in its nature. The musical score was not bad either. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, this movie is pretty poor. I could not see it all the time, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs out of sheer boredom. Of course, it is not "Torque" bad, but still does not have a high rating, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
