If you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you can approach the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster films and has done much better. Those who think that "Scarface" was a kind of hero to admire or see "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "That's life for me!" You will like this movie. I thought I would give the movie a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing that Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a fourth grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
