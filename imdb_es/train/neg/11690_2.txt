It is a waist to please such great actors in a film so weak and boring. In addition to all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what is so difficult to capture the thieves? Simply eliminate the employees of the bank, see who was in the bank, from all angles of filming the cameras, before the entry of thieves and have those 4 additional thieves among the hostages. Where is the suspense that all bodies are talking? It was so obvious at the time that the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that everyone was going to go out the front door ... they saw it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the film with a good musical score and an artistic shot. The movie is not worth it. Soon!
