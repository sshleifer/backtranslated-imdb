I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV ad. Before that, I did not even know it existed. I saw the trailer online and decided that I would go see it. Now that I'm a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this movie would give me everything I wanted. He has Michael Keaton in him, and he rocks. Unfortunately the film was not delivered. He tried to be another sixth sense or agitation of echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the medium simply creeps and repeats itself, and ends with a completely bad turn that any monkey could have discovered. Unfortunately, like most "scary" movies nowadays, it is based on loud noises and blows to make the audience jump. This movie could have been much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
