Nominated for the Oscar to the "worst script of all" in my opinion. There is no decent story, a ridiculous performance, a VERY unpleasant mood. By all possible means, if you have little respect for yourself, do not waste time watching this movie. Although you can see that the actors CAN ACT, it leaves you more foolish after seeing it. They are killing precious brain cells watching this shit ... <br /> <br /> I warned you <br /> <br /> YOU DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE
