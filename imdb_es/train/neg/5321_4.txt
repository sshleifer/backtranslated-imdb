A uniquely extravagant musical comedy that tries to marry artificially with the vanguard of the explosion of rock 'n' roll with the sensibility of the middle class of a suburban comedy. The result is a messy dating that will not satisfy any of the audiences that went through the music, but at least it will keep their parents satiated. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the promotion article on the back of the video should give an idea of ​​the content. Tom Ewell is a drunken, exaggerated agent with so little comic ability that you almost expect him to shout "Hi honey, I'm home!" The propaganda places it as "Very funny in 'The 7 Year Itch'". It sounds almost like an excuse. What other movie would be sold by the fact that a leading player was good at something else? It reads like "Very funny in 'The 7 Year Itch' ... but it's silly in this." <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with a 50-inch rumor of assets, is, unfortunately, a bargain basement. Monroe with all the acting ability and the comical timing of a rotting haddock. His delivery of wood combined with the double OTT shots of Ewell make this a Hell comedy. For its part, the sale gives us: "[[Jayne Mansfield] whose most obvious talents are the cause of many of the biggest laughs in the movie!" As you can see, a movie sold with the idea that lead has a large chest is not the most sophisticated. Most of this "humor" is that men literally fall on themselves, break glasses on the Mansfield site, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of an overflowing bottle of milk casts doubt on his "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> For the musical side, most players are chosen. Would you really like to see Eddie Fontaine offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than French fries" in a song called "Cool It, Baby"? Only the incendiary Little Richard leaves the MOR, although he is forced to sing some of his most friendly songs for the father in a four-minute sequence. And how is it that all acts sing without a single microphone? The attempts of satires in the industry are broad and childish in their conception. <br /> <br /> Technically, the image was quite advanced, with special effects (including a ghost like Julie London) and a fancy color (which now looks flat and In fact, with its reds that bleed and the tones of fake-looking skin, it looks like a colored film, however, the direction is not outstanding and the sound quality is also quite poor. <br /> <br /> It may be that it is very old. a time when men continued to smoke on the screen, the children's actors, who were disgustingly cute, made comments about adults and the black servants could only cook and dance. (Everything that happens here.) However, some like it the heat, the African queen, Ben Hur and many, many more are examples of movies of the period that can still be enjoyed today, so the argument "good at that time" does not hold. Can not Help It is a cynical and paternalistic company that does not support a to thorough inspection. 4/10. <br /> <br />
