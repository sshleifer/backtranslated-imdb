CLASSIFICATION OF STARS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US Army has just launched an important new stealth fighter aircraft that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plans to ask the government of the United States to rescue him. So they are forced to send their best man, John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his mind had to be erased from all the incriminating information that he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I missed the Attack Force because I could see through the cover and all the post-production manipulation that had occurred that it would be a shit and when all the negative criticism and the low qualification of the users appeared, I just confirmed That's what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a chance because Shadow Man (from the same director) was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and maybe, just maybe, I could make a great movie again. Oh, what a fool he was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, horrific aerial fighter aircraft images, horrible camera work, cheap production values, irritable and unconvincing fighting scenes that have become the trademark of Seagal and a boring dream and inductive. A plot that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'll be jumping), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more. Of these horrible action movies with European lenses and his next film, Prince of Pistols could mark a return to the theaters. Hell, he's done it before and Stallone will have done it before him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not a Flight of Fury. It's not even a fun flight. It's a flight that does not even take off from the ground. *
