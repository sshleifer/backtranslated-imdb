Absolutely horrid movie. Ameteurish and it's not funny at all. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. The editions by E.T and star wars are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good thought about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Apart from Goksal, this movie is garbage. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is his worst written work to date. <br /> <br /> The music of Cem Karaca is another. more of this loss of money. The actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. The actor who plays the three children has no talent.
