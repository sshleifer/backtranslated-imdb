A bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... this is one of the movies, which does not have a single positive effect. Simply everything, from actors to stories, reeks of heaven. I wonder how low I.Q. You should see this type of movie and even enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Is there anything worth seeing? Well, there's a lot of nakedness involved, but it's nothing special. And when you only think it could not get worse, you realize that all the naked women seemed to be forty years old. Come on guys, where were these actresses looking for? In the nursing home, maybe. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the main actresses have some sex appeal and they know how to prove it. Once again, it is a pity that it is too thin and old. In general, skip this one. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
