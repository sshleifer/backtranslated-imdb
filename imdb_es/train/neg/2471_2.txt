I remember when I was little when I was outside the camp and camped under the stars. There was always someone there who had a good story to tell that involved the forests that surrounded us and always scared me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I reviewed it with the hope of being one of those movies that had a supernatural being that chased people in the forest like the stories told in the camp. Well, to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three heads to their winter cabin, which looks like their normal suburban home and swims like a cabin in the woods, and they come across a deer. Well, it seems that the local paletos were hunting this particular deer and they are quite annoyed with the people of our city. The film spends too much time following the daily activities of the families instead of getting to the point of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes that we really had any action related to the "wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay far away from this movie. It will leave you wanting your hour and a half behind.
