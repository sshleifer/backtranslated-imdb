(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Once someone asked Dr. Seuss if he could secure the film rights of his 1957 Christmas classic, How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He rejected them, insisting that no one could do better than the wonderful 1966 Chuck Jones television special (also in his opinion, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script in The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, 1953) . When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, stubbornly refused to sell the rights to the film. But with the usual use of CGI effects became a reality, Ms. Geisel changed her mind. Universal made her a generous offer that she accepted; She also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes us one of us. <br /> <br /> The film received a budget of $ 123,000,000 (which is even greater than the cost of Heaven's Gate, including the adjustment for inflation), which was obviously earmarked for elaborate makeup, set design and special effects ( that are undermined <br /> <br /> partly by the somewhat confusing cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that he did not reserve any of that money to get a script better than Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit ?, Which made it much better <br /> <br /> of a high budget). While the TV special had 26 minutes of clipping without ads, this movie tries to complete a 105 minute run time with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was mocked, including a particularly humiliating Christmas experience at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that afflicts our poor Mr. Grinch is directly due to the Whos. The problem is that it seems a rather long time of 105 minutes, with a lot of dead wood obstructing the story. It may not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more ... well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and then Chuck Jones encouraged was an astute fox whose skillful attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a noisy, hyperactive buzz and, sometimes, a bully who, when he made the 'Cheermeister' vacation, destroys the town square of Whoville with fury <br /> <br /> (hopefully, the Landscape was as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all Whos in Whoville so unfriendly (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Dr. Seuss's Whoville vision was a small town populated by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy place full of people populated by spoiled, selfish and materialistic boyfriends; An obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensive <br /> <br /> hypocritical insofar as the film industry has greatly benefited from American consumerism, and how this film contributed to this with a major marketing campaign. <br /> <br /> <br /> <The movie also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old child who entered this espújico Santa Claus is now older and wiser, constantly questions the false values ​​of the Whos and tries to understand the Grinch's point of view (his only main scene of the original is represented, making it seem out of place). She <br /> <br /> seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and ornaments, which makes her a completely different and more annoying character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas must first accept a piece of charcoal in their stockings <br /> <br /> on the morning of December 25 that a copy of this extensive, exaggerated, unbearably tedious, clumsy and rude attempt to turn children into a feature film. Proof once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and hard hand are inadequate substitutes for charm, ingenuity, sincerity and heart. The people of Universal should kneel and thank God that this truly malicious $ 123 million bomb raised $ 260 million in the country or they would not be here today. It also made the Cat in Mike Myers' hat possible!
