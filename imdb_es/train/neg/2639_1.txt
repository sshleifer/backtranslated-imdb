First let's start this review with the fact that I registered just to write the review and warn people to save their money. This was one of the worst pieces of trash I've seen since The Hulk. The story was the most predictable crap you could find. If you wait 24 but on the big screen, download that expectation into the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket. In this way, you can enjoy more. The performance was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "turn" at the end.) I must say this, the ending surprised me, I do not mean the plot twist that surprised me, but the simple way in which they created what could be considered the ONLY decent action scene in the whole movie, they ran the ending so fast that I did not even realize it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that moment I considered burning the film roll if you could figure out how to get into that projection room. <br /> <br /> The casting was horrible for several reasons.First of all, they must have accidentally changed the character assignments, because Michael Douglas played the role that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland He should have been playing while Douglas was hiding agents, touching telephone lines, hacking systems and eliminating the people who were chasing him, Sutherland plays less capable agent who is always ab even when things are not going so badly for him. He plays a very insipid agent, there's nothing like his Jack Bauer guy. We love 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can be better compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "In The Line of Fire", but written by people with mental disabilities
