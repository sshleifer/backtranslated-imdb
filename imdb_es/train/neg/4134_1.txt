Honestly, I must say that I could not stop watching this movie from the moment it started. Simply because it was so bad !!! It's a bit like seeing the paint dries much more confused. I mean you sit there and you just wait for something to happen, anything, in fact, preferably something that makes the whole movie make sense! At the end of the movie, I sat there wondering if there was any chance that I might have missed the first hour explaining everything or if I had inadvertently fainted during the film and had missed the parts that hit the plot (if indeed there was one) together! The main thing that really confused me about this movie, is that almost at the end the main girl (if there really was a main girl) was in some kind of alternate reality, I mean, what the hell was going on right now? Suddenly, she woke up and was in a mental institution, chained to a bed drugged by doctors or something, then, faster than it would have taken me to cut my wrists, she leaned back and a random vampire was eating her . It did not make any sense! I am tempted to send an email to the creators and demand that they give me back my time. I mean, I lost 2 hours of my life watching this garbage! I'm interested in knowing if the filmmakers themselves really knew what it was about. It looked like someone had edited all the fragments that could have made sense, although I think the movie would have to have lasted 4 hours for that to happen! I completely side with the other person who wrote the other review, I was really cheated with this movie by its title, and only that. I'm just very grateful that I did not buy the film, no matter how many times I saw it at the local pound store. You'd think that would have given me a hint that the movie was a lot of smoking junk from movies, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 was too much money to spend on this movie! What a waste of time and a good razor blade! I mean, I wish it had happened to me, it's less painful than watching this movie.
