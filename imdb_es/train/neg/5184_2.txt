I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed on many levels. In the first place, history is so poorly recycled that it makes it almost unbearable. Second, the setting, the acting and the story are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many more black actors to choose from than these standard selections. How about a little originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in their entirety, if any. None seemed really central. In general, the film was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and it almost made the movie worthwhile.
