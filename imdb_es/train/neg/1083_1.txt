This movie is like real life, what I want to say: not many things happen in the approximately 2 hours available, and the often invisible plan does not evidence much the game plan or the plot (its invisibility is due to the experimental lighting " "as mentioned by many critics). <br /> <br /> A big hole. It's no wonder that Altman takes care of this: he's a very variable actor (yes, we all love "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" to someone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and The Women? Aaargh) , but the fact that La materia prima is a story by John Grisham, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the compilation of your insistent lethargy, makes this a true masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> It's just bad.
