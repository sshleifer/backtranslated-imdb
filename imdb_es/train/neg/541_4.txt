I thought that this movie was a rarity. From the first moment, I found it extremely difficult that I liked this movie, and now, after thinking about it a bit, I can specify the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I adore it in pieces (I think Zentropa is one of the best films that have ever been made) is a mistake here, and although I can not imagine for my life who would be better, I'm sure someone could have Taken its place quite easily and make this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs in the weak comedy (Meet the Parents Joke is not really needed, the filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as the greatest Brit. He only suffers from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
