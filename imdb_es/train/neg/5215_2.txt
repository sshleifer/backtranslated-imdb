It's the same old man, "If I can not get the funds for my project, I'll inject myself" monster movie. There is nothing new here. It looks a lot like the movie "Fly" by Jeff Goldblum. Man manages to maintain some sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. There are people who act stupidly along the way, endangering their lives for no apparent reason. The guy keeps coming back to the laboratory he's been banned from entering. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. It is true that he is handsome, but he seems to have many problems. It's just a big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaur costume looks like it came off a Star Trek convention.
