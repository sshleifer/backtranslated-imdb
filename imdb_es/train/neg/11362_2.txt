"Fly Me To The Moon" has to be the worst animation movie I've seen in a long time. That's saying something, since I've taken my son to see every animated release for the past 4 years. The story is to be generous ... trite. The voice acting is atrocious, it sounds too cute. The humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a type of Nickolodeon cartoon, but it is being published on the big screen, not on cable television. <br /> <br /> You get a 2 only because the 3-D graphics are OK. Some of the scenes had a slightly stimulating image, but we have seen much better in the past. I also question the filmmakers' insistence that the characters fly off the screen instead of in most scenes. While that is interesting at first, it became exhausting after the third or fourth time. It seemed a blow of indifference for me on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that it had a pretty good soundtrack. And for the record, my son did not like it too much either. Bad movie.
