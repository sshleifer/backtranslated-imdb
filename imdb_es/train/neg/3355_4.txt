There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically a one woman show. Catherine Zeta Jones was there just to offer you treats. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The movie was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who had a real part in this script by David Self. Ok, it was the first one and he redeemed himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was the problem of director Jan de Bont. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. He really fell at work here. Maybe he was still recovering from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. You should thank your lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise, this would be the worst image of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs.
