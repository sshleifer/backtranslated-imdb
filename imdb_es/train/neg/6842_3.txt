"Paula, I may be a bitch, but I'll never be a sissy!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in a skin movie that is otherwise quite tedious and shows a nice honey in Stacey Walker, but that's it. This girl is a real joke that attracts her boyfriends, coworkers and even her lesbian partner, Paula, to her room, but then it becomes a screaming job that screams "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certification c ** t is interesting for a moment, but this story eventually becomes a real case of a repetitive note. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who still care about that time.
