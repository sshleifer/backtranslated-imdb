First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that emotion for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having curls and glasses with gas and that was considered very uncool. In the film, she has straight hair and no glasses and is "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not the way Madeleine L'Engle imagined Meg. In fact, Meg relied on Madeleine's character and described how she felt when she was young. This is just an important example of how the book and the film are different. So, I'd say if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, look at it, but if you're a fan of Madeleine L'Engle and his Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest you skip this movie.
