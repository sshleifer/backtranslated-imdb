It contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> The British director J. Lee Thompson made some excellent films, especially 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Cape Fear', but 'Country Dance' is one of his most curious offers. The story is set among the upper classes of rural Scotland and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric landlord aristocrat, his sister Hilary and Hilary's exiled husband, Douglas, who awaits a reconciliation with her. We learned that during his career as an army officer, Charles was considered to have "low moral fiber." This seems to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film she shows an attitude of grim disillusionment with the world, and her main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and her bottle of whiskey. The movie ends with his commitment to a high-class insane asylum. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole was, when he was at his best as in 'Lawrence of Arabia', one of Britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and 'Country Dance 'is Not one of his best movies. He acts extremely frantically, turning Charles into a caricature of the useless innate aristocrat, as if he were auditioning for a part in the Monty Python sketch "Twit of the Year" by Monty Python. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are quite better, but there is not a really outstanding performance in the film. There is also little in the sense of the coherent plot, beyond the story of Charles's inexorable downward slide. <br /> <br /> However, the main problem with the film is not the acting or the plot, but rather the one in the film. Subject that does not dare to say his name. There is little enthusiastic evidence of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction to her on her part, and that her aversion to Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is presented as 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the British Council of Film Censors was willing to allow, and a film with a theme explicitly incestuous. It was definitely out of bounds. (The American title for the film was "Brotherly Love," but it was not used in Britain, was it too suggestive for the BBFC's taste?) Therefore, these suggestions never develop and we can never see what motivates Charles or what. it has caused its moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole in the center. 4/10
