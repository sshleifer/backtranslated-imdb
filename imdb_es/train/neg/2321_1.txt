I can not believe that this program still has a rating of 9 out of 10. I can see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would someone have to continue ranking it high after that? I was a big fan of the 1st season. I was hooked, all the mystery, the suspense, the unexplainable events. You never knew what was going to happen next. For season 2, I was still observing faithfully, but I was getting a little frustrated because some basic things had not yet been explained. And instead of giving you more answers, they just seemed like more questions. I LOVE the suspense, but you have to throw a bone at people from time to time to keep them watching. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of dating, and clearly you can not miss an episode to be aware of what is happening. Therefore, it was not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It's a shame they could not have been a little smarter and more considerate of the faithful followers. I agree with some of the posters that ABC seems to have become greedy and decided to see how long this show can stretch. Do not they realize that in the end, they're going to lose more fans than they could win?
