My first attempt to see this ended in 8 minutes, approximately after the scene of the TV report, which I could not handle. It went approximately like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think they are extraterrestrials. * uncomfortable silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later, I saw it until the end, and it was not as horrible as I had imagined, but there are serious problems with this. Approximately half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something like that. <br /> <br /> What good are the detective, the eugenic people and the monsters that Horus eliminates momentarily? More fun was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" Gods ", that we have lived for eons, and of all the games in the multiverse, we play the monopoly". Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken seems coherent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to freeze cryogenically? Why was not there a big event when he was released at the end? I had those annoying followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What is the deal with the masked boy? How did the blue-haired girl appear? What happens with your sight? Etcetera etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually it's fine, more or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods who look like pedestrians with rotating heads.
