Totally predictable program of nonsense about a man who has killed his wife by cutting her while driving and claims that she has fainted. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car after killing his wife with one? This question has not occurred to writers. The story then talks about a psychologist and her failed marriage, which is linked to the failed marriage of a blackout driver who killed his wife. An omniscient mother and a three-dimensional child are thrown to a large extent, and the whole accumulates for a foreseeable ending and a crashing end. Are police psychologists so easily admitted? Deadly writing with which actors do everything possible, but are doomed to fail. This is on par with a Harlequin Romance. Do not waste your time watching this unless it is what you are looking for.
