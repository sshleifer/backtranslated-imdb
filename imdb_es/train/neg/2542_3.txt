... it's not that all Disney movies are garbage. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" for the first time and I loved the movie. When I heard that I had 2 sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and saw it one night. I do not see how they can make a sequel classified G for a horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about the monster Fauke, and it can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be watched by anyone. I do not remember the plot too well, since it's been a long time since I saw it and I will not see it again, but ... It's about these hunters coming to the city and going to kill Bigfoot. Three small children leave the house to stop them. A great monsoon arrives. The hunters are hurt, they are saved by the children. Then, all hide in a boat with a large piece of canvas on top and try to hold the storm. Then, suddenly, Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin the end for any of the yas, but it's not scary. All right....
