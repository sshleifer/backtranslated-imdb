I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I thought, well, no matter how stupid this movie is, I can at least see him kick his ass, right? Incorrect. This is a boring and monotonous mess of useless conversations, half-hyphenated writing and meaningless machinations. There are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are recorded and edited so badly that you can not even distinguish what is happening in the world. The dubbing is also atrocious, and maybe the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that supposedly presents the Italian mafia ... EXCEPT THAT ARE ALL Japanese! Avoid like the plague: you would see better martial arts if you look out the window of your local karate preschool class for five minutes.
