This movie only got a 1 because you can not give a zero! If you have a weak belly, DO NOT look. people of the rights of animals that you do not want to see either. It makes people vegetarian. I swear I witnessed this! The only interesting parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really super creepy that this guy worked in ADT while killing people! Do you still feel safe when you enter that little code? I do not! He had access to all the codes in Kansas !!! I hated the movie, it was not scary, I was mentally scared! Do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy this movie, I think it costs around $ 20, INCLUDE your actors OVER!
