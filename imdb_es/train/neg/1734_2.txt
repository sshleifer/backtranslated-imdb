I'm a big fan of old westerns, and I do not think Hollywood is capable of capturing its former glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help this 1957 film, which presents almost all the hackneyed characteristics of the reformed gunsman's westerns that became a good boy. Woman fallen, but virtuous, intolerant people who must resort to a gunman for salvation, etc. I can not help but notice the last names of the writer and young "actor" who plays the son of Granger. Any nepotism there? I have seen better acting in secondary works. Chill Wills plays a caricature of Chill Wills. Have I already reached 1000 words?
