This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering that I've seen stinkers like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is very close). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can see in my username, it really stands out. Sometimes there is nothing more entertaining than a badly made slasher movie. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman fry in a tanning booth seems to have no relation to the film, especially because the film does not tell her that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the movie . The performance is nonexistent, and most of the camera shots are of women's areas wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most monotonous and stone-faced actor I have ever seen in my life. The best / worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant security pin? What were you thinking? Who is the murderer? A dissatisfied "Huggies" employee? I would have to give this film a general zero, but if I had not liked watching it
