The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a campy charm: it opens with text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson recites to his next victims in "Pulp Fiction"), continues with two karate schools the New York masters discuss about the eternal question of humanity (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, who plays himself; He immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, is soon crushed by the disjointed story, the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action. To make it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that are there, are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is great. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is glorious. It's just for them that I give "The Bodyguard" a second star of 10. This movie makes 87 minutes seem like 5 hours.
