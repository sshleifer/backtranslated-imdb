I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens and a choppy edition did not give me the feeling of being in the world of the methamphetamine head, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few brief moments. The movie never seemed to go anywhere and the acting was really an excellent example of acting. I love the films that allow us to glimpse the sordid underworld, but this movie could not decide if it was a bad horror movie or an even worse comment about the horrors of addiction.
