I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage? OK, my dad and my mom love lol but I make sure I'm out of the room before it turns on. It's so depressing and depressing, but the worst part is that I can not stand all the detective programs of this kind because the detectives are so cunning and ruthless. What happened to the detective programs with real mystery? I mean, who wants to know what happened to the fictional characters we know nothing about who died more than 20 years ago? I would like the BBC to put more comedy on BBC1 because now that the Dibley vicar has finished, there is more room for this crap.
