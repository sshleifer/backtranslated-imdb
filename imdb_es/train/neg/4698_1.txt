I mean seriously, what group would you sing about a crazy car? So, what if they are ten years old? It's too immature for a little boy to sing about "being my women" I mean it! The name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? Just because they take off their pants? HOW CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a television show. I mean most of the artists do not really need a TV show about themselves, especially the band of the naked brothers. Heck how many of them are in the damn group. And seriously, what about the movie? Jeez Nick used to be the highlight of my growing years, but seriously, the band of naked brothers? So many parents did not let their children see this, especially with the name of Naked Brother's band, it's a stupid and not creative show that should not be broadcast on television.
