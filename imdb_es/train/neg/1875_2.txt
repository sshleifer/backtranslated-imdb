First of all, I really loved Henry Fool, who places me in a very small group of moviegoers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses today. But this movie was a total farce. Seeing Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras, full of pride and making useless analogies to Star Wars, gave him a twist. This was exaggerated by the producers (HDNET) made to the fullest. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. Above all I feel that Hal has spoiled HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I can see him again in his pure and innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember, Hal, you can FIND some of the people sometimes ... etc. The director would not be anywhere today if all he did was throw away meaningless garbage. Sadly, it is a pure example of the lesson taught in the movie ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or your box office hopes are slim. It does not matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The score, I think of Hartley, has no flavor. With drum beats walking through the entire dialogue. I recognized that there was an Apple Soundtrack loop that smiled at me. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought: they are just trying to capture a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I would love to spoil this movie, but it has been done. It's rotten The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
