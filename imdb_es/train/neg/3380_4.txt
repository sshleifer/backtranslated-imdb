The Broadway show by Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante took place over the years, but evidence of his power and charisma is lost in this film adaptation, which probably derives from the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as far from B-way as you can) and main actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director and choreographer as a troubled corporate lawyer). The svelte story, about a bold audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for the actors, dancers and singers, is presented to us, with loud and noisy talents that touch the beams. Nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a secondary argument of laughter about an ex-dancer who returns to the theater and confronts Douglas. Overly anxious aspirants are full of promises and anguish, but their personal stories of anguish are a little embarrassing; this, combined with the slow rhythm of Attenborough, the disaster of the spells, and even the now famous songs fail to break the artificial wrapping. * 1/2 of ****
