This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It is VERY boring, with many boring dialogues and has some VERY annoying characters and a laughable looking creature. The only reason I saw this piece of junk is because it was on the 8-disc horror set that I got. The plot is absurd and totally stupid as it is the end. No blood, except a few bloody marks on the creature, and a couple of bloody bullet wounds. The performance is TERRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite ridiculous, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and it was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was not FUN either! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so here and had no chemistry with Richard. In general, avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! PUMP of 5.
