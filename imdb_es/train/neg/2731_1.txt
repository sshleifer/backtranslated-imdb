Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen ... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to compensate by giving it the routine of 'we know we are doing this'. That would have been fun if it were not for the fact that 'The Simpsons' had already done it. And it still would not make up if they had the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks took place as part of the fantasies of the usual characters (mainly J.D). The flashbacks were not even real events that happened, just compilations of, say, J.D falling or, I do not know ... Elliott falling. If I wanted to see a compilation of Scrubs, I would go to YouTube and I would not lose half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Scrubs has fallen into the trap that most diners have to make, and disappoints me. I, managed to spend 5 seasons and a quarter without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the bushes did not have to be that kind of comedies. <br /> <br /> And as a passing thought, why the hell was Dr.Cox bald?
