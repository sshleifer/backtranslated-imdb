And that's all it is. This thing is slow. The actors have capacity, they just do not seem to be motivated to make the effort. The plot is not so big and is hampered by the slowness of everything mentioned above. The accents, when they exist, are British. Uh, a lot of these people are supposed to be Danish. OK, OK, the accents are not so important. But the language is. I do not think they have used words like "yes" and "OK" in the days of Beowulf. And that supposedly great weapon that his king gave him? Did you ever recharge that thing? Did you ever see it? Or was Beowulf as bad as a target? Well, its objective at least matched the computer graphics used to generate the monsters. Those were also pretty dull. Bad special effects. Bright point? Only one I can think of. Marina Sirtis has stayed well in recent years.
