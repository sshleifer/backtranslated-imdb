When I started watching this movie for the first time, I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors, but I soon realized that this movie was really about people on a train. The interactions between people are like those that can be seen any day on the street and, when there is sometimes a slightly more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes tedious and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this film tries to represent the way people interact, but that in this movie they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships, it would be better to go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It's realistic, but you would not see a movie to see a movie about you sitting there watching the movie.
