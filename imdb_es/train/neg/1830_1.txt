This is the worst movie I've seen. I'm not kidding. The next time it is turned on, I will simply run my head against a wall continuously. I would much rather sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen instead of trying to get through this movie again. Such a bad project again. both are good comedians, so I was surprised that this was so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> If they had to do it all over again, I'm pretty sure they would decide not to do it. The people who faced the money must have lost a ton. Not really, because the special effects (the 2) were terrible.
