I grew up watching Disney's original Cinderella, and I've always liked it so much that the tape is a bit worn. <br /> <br /> As a result, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was going to appear on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins the movie sequel club that should have been left alone. It remains absolutely none of the original super charm! In my opinion, it is quite crude and almost brutal, from the (not) Sing-a-longs to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember that the character tells a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was placed on top, and it did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human being is a good example: when I walked around eating an apple and adding some little jokes here and there, I should have been dancing and singing about how wonderful it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there's old barn type country music. It is as if the writers had forgotten where and when this story was established. The optimistic violins certainly did not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the illustration and the animation in Cinderella 2 are not up to the original. The illustrations in this movie seem pretty crude and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which does not feel good. <br /> <br /> The film itself could have been its own story, I think it should have been just that. I would not say I hate him, but I think he had many shortcomings. It seems to significantly reduce the original of beloved Cinderella.
