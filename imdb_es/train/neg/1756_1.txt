In the background for years (as reported), this television meeting of two of the most beloved characters in the history of comedies began badly, and went downhill from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) are in New York after a long distance and catch up in their lives. What a novel concept! But unfortunately, nothing worth talking about (much less making a movie) has happened to any of them in the intervening years. So, instead, the script is content with throwing an old and old plot device after another (most has to do with older women in the workplace), while lacking the charm and sophistication strangers who made the original show a winner. The supporting cast is forgotten at once, the humor is non-existent and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once had together is gone. Moore allegedly stopped this project for years, waiting for "the right script" before committing. If this was what she considered "correct", how on earth were those that she rejected? It is not the age of the characters that does this (because time inevitably advances), but the almost total lack of imagination along with blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. At some point this was thought as a pilot but, obviously, did not generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, among potential audiences. Forgotten and mercifully forgotten, the film is a farce and an insult to a classic.
