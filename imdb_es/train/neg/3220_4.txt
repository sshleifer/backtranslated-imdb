['I absolutely hate that a movie completely collapses at the end, after you&#39;ve already invested an hour in it. And that&#39;s what happened with this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his original story. I have not been to read that story, but I can not imagine it ending so this movie ends. Fortunately, I did not pay much money to see it or rent it because my library had it. Ohhhh, what a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect). But milo o&#39;shea as a Jewess? Now THAT was funny. I have not investigated how it was made, but played as the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the movie. Before that point, a story and characters were being developed, there was a series of plot points ordered and not too much time was lost. but ooh that lasted 1/2 hour, if that was not the most daring and worthless outcome that I have witnessed, I do not know what it is. I just hate when one&#39;s faith is so destroyed like that; It feels like an act of violence.']
