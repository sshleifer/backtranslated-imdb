Che's charisma and appearance have as much to do with his iconic stature as with the misinformation that leftist propaganda (like this movie) has spread about him. <br /> <br /> I do not know which is worse: to be captured by one of Che's assassination squads or to have to sit for 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question is not why this pet project was made, but why it took so long. By "them" I mean, of course, to Hollywood on the left and its "secret" love to the Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... choose). I am fascinated that it took decades for one of the less talented liberal directors of Tinseltown to finally take on a propaganda project so irresistibly biased. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated "artists" have often given themselves over to similar, politically unilateral projects, but somehow Che Guevara, who is possibly the most popular and well-known communist, has not been a cinematic subject of them yet. <Br /> <br /> "Guerrilla" has all the characteristics of an American story of an epic scale; There are as many factual details that can be found here as in other biographies of similar big-budget Hollywood fairytale political tales, such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi," that is, almost none. The film stars Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. However, however controversial and criminal have been the actions of this man, one thing that no one could take away: was an intelligent manipulator that came from a rich family, so Del Toro meets the requirements visually. Del Toro can be an interesting and charismatic actor, and can resemble Guevara physically, but does not exude intellectual qualities, which makes Guevara too primitive. The election of mediocrities such as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only underscores the director's lack of good judgment. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the film is extremely slow (not surprising), and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have thoughtfully launched a film that goes beyond 3 hours, so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid films and at the beginning of his career, think that His oceanic greatness was up to the task. If you think that the duration of the movie indicates that a part of Che's life has been shown here, then think again. Soderbergh focuses on the last phase of Che, and much of the film is a tedious jest of the jungle, full of the supposed idealism of Guevara. (Psychopaths do not have ideals.) I wonder what kind of mind this highly esteemed director must have to really ignore something about Che's previous life. Did you really consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people has no interest for the viewer, huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this exaggerated charlatan would have easily fit not one, but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a certain sense, becomes an accomplice by never approaching the negative. dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By propagating this kind of historical inaccuracy, consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God does not want to stain the sacred image of Che), Soderbergh shows that he is not a humanist, a false image that most Hollywood personalities and pop music they fight very hard all their careers to confirm, but the opposite: that only worries about ideas, never about the people in which these ideas are tested (as in guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the "proletariat" (which is a stupid term) with which they are supposedly on the side. <br /> <br /> Half of the students from all over the world wear the image of Che in their red and orange shirts, but never knowing why. It has become an iconic figure for young clueless, misinformed, very often, who think that having the face of this man in the chest, somehow makes them look "avant-garde", intellectual, modern or interesting. In fact, the use of a Che shirt only highlights the general shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (Would not YOU want to know more about a person before you start announcing your face to the world?) Che's clich√©d image has now become as common as having a cup of Bart Simpson coffee. All those "Che carriers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they will ever read about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that had been done in the name of Marx, one would think that these mestizo "ideals" would finally be put to rest. It seems that humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the iron curtain, one hundred million dead, over one billion ruined physically and / or mentally through this system ... so none of that matters , Huh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro has won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who have no idea how Cannes and other European festivals work, and vote. Hint: Sean Penn was in charge of a jury recently. <br /> <br /> For information on my speeches related to music, visit: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
