At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) that's why she is constantly looking for an adventure. She said "because I'm bored-phobic". It means that she really can not continue with her life doing some obligatory activities. Well, I think his reason and the way this film is developed is very ironic. Because "Observe the detectives" is a joyful boredom. <br /> <br /> Are any of these characters doing something exciting for once? Neil is a geek who runs his own video rental store, very small. He and his other geek friends often hang out in the store and watch movies together as they debate about them later. But Neil's life is completely changed when Violet enters his store. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from her. Anyway, after some appointments, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who keeps making jokes about Neil and really can not do something normal, while Neil is completely opposed to hers. The question is. Are they going to be in love at the end? You gamble. <br /> <br /> "Observe the detectives" is a romantic comedy clich√© in its essence. And they did it even worse by pretending to be something else. From the first couple of preparations, we know that Neil is a pretty relaxed guy who really did not commit to anything. And then, Violet enters the scene, looking strange and annoying. So, at this point, we all know that we are going to sit in all nonsense situations to discover how they will end up in the end. The wait is worth it? I would say not. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something else for the audience. "Observing the detectives" is trying to talk about compromise. To observe how far people reach to achieve something they want. In the end, we knew that the follies that Violet has done are all evidence of how far Neil is ready to go to win his heart (or whatever). Well, I think it's completely nonsense. This movie will end pretty quickly if Neil just says to himself "Forget it, that girl is one of the best!" After collaborating with many great directors recently ("Sunshine" by Danny Boyle and "28 Days Later", "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" by Ken Loach and "Breakfast on Pluto" by Neil Jordan, to name a few), is a Pretty strange choice for Cillian Murphy will make a movie with one of the Broken Lizard comedy, Paul Soter. Anyway, it's not bad (as always), but a talented actor like him should not waste his time in the movie in this way. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly terrible like Violet. His performance is a disaster. I mean it's all over the place and so exaggerated. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not least error that this movie made is a completely irrelevant title. You just can not connect a point between the plot and its title; and then you'll end up thinking that it does not make any sense at all. In short, "Watching the detectives" is nice if you can forget a moving picture, and you may have the chance to catch it on cable television so fast you could not imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
