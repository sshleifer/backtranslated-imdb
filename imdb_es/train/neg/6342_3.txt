I picked this up at the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like (this), go on your own!") In the box ... it looked like a sound backup ... I expected something a little more like "Proof of death" ... not much real violence in this, or plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It's all there. Tricks, and rock. Comes and goes. A week or so in the life of a Los Angeles band that makes a shitty magic show, at a level you might see at one of the smaller casinos on the Strip, and a new Australian specialist in the city finding their feet ... They work, they know girls, they celebrate. End of story. <br /> <br /> The band obviously needed all those things because they are frankly second level and they play a style that was already dated in 1978. It must be said that the tricks in the film are genuinely thorny - that Australian is really something , and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for "art". I hung it there to see what madness I would do next. I just wish I had found a better vehicle.
