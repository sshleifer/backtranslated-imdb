The sequels have the bad habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that it maintains that ancient tradition. These three stories are not as good as the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far, the best of the trio consists of a wooden idol that comes alive to take revenge on the thugs who killed their owners. The second story is about a lake monster that seems to be nothing but a large amount of floating slope, which makes you wonder how anyone could be afraid of it. The third story includes a cameo by Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than that, it is a rather unmemorable story about the victim of a traffic accident returning from the dead by the person who knocked him down. <br /> <br /> Look at the original Creepshow instead, or if you have already done so, then be happy with that.
