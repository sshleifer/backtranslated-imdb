"Algie, the miner" is a bad and graceless silent comedy. The slapstick time is completely off. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they are supposed to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This visualization is mandatory for moviegoers, mainly because it is one of the first examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an effeminate boy, who looks a lot like the stereotyped "thought" common in many old movies. The film has the common homophobic attitude of the time. "Algie, the mining company" is quite horrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
