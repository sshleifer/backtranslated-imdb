This movie is really horrible. After seeing the announcement of this, I thought I could have its charms ... but it was not like that. Girls can not act, and they can not sing either. The soundtrack of this movie is full of its songs, and it is not a pretty picture, Terrible story story, incredible plot, it is one of the worst movies of Disney of FAR! Ally is not a bad actress in "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, seems to be simply hooked on the "fame" of her sisters, and she shows no talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the girls finally learn a bit of clich√©. moral, but this is too late to rescue this movie from train crash. <br /> <br /> It's horrible
