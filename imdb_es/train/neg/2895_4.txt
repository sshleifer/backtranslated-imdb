The premise of this movie is revealed in the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that does not degrade. But the film can not move forward. Instead, rest for 45 minutes, avoiding a preamble before you make the great discovery. Since audiences do not benefit much from seeing a whimsical child discover things, it's a strange choice: the film has been prevented from committing to any subject. Once the fabric is discovered, the film establishes too quickly that both industry chicks and blue-collar companions want the invention to be crushed, leaving the film with only two flimsy movements; invent the chemical and flee from the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone describes it as comedy. The tone is not funny or funny. It is more like a serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism distorts supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, that's probably true, but without a little play with an attitude towards that fact, the film is simply a serious argument. You will need a very broad definition of comedy to find one here. <br /> <br /> This is more like a meeting with Briton John Doe (Do you know Nigel Doe?).
