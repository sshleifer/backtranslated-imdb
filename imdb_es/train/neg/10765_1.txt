A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly dirtied it. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Big Sky," writer Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly assumed that they could improve upon a pioneering classic novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author AB Guthrie. By doing so, they eliminated the soul of the story and any advantage and impact that may have had as a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill. From a naive, Kentucky boy to a hardened and competent mountain survivor / man, he has been replaced by a small-scale boat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intention. In the movie version, the presence of Boone is nothing but disappointing. <br /> <br /> Elements of the intriguing and even shocking plot that give Guthrie's novel the impact and the excitement have been eliminated for no apparent reason. Most disconcerting of all is the emphasis placed on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a secondary and secondary character in the book, and only occupied a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is completely gone! It is also clear that director Hawks decided that Zeb's character in the film, played by actor Hunnicutt, was not annoying enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time to perform that hateful voice-over narration that is Hollywood's shortcut for the incompetent writing, editing and direction of the screen. <br /> <br /> Some films have actually improved the books on which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is an excellent example). But this is horrible and depressing, not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and clich√©, and the characters, at least those that have not been edited. of the script: shadows are shallow and boring of the literary vision of Guthrie. And unfortunately, the attractive star of Kirk Douglas, who could have helped lift this film, was harassed by the role of the milk they gave him. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer, winner of the sequel prize, "The Way West", also starring Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further reinforces the place of Howard Hawks as one of the most overrated and lukewarm directors in the world. History of cinema.
