... then you better not see this movie. They have completely ruined the premise of the show. In the movie, Duke children are idiots, Daisy is evil, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are faithful to the original characters. At least, Enos is a bit close. <br /> <br /> At one point, they open the doors to enter General Lee, he said. Nuff. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the original program was not excellent. , but it was entertaining and the characters made sense. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets Simple Life.
