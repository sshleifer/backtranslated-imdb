Without wanting to be a murderer, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and cliché movies I've ever seen: this is one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the impression is of poor quality, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you could do better". Maybe it's a challenge for all of us to saturate YouTube with our own trash related to zombies. <br /> <br /> I bought this for £ 1, but remember that you can not put a price in 71 minutes of your life. You would do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain price.
