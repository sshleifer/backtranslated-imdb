When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" generates more than $ 75 million, it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society. Or, collectively, we are too stupid to avoid garbage in this way or maybe I do not realize how many people will attract this type of garbage effortlessly. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has no incentives to make good movies because if it throws garbage, people will see it anyway since there is nothing else on the screen. This is it. I left despite getting a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be more foolish. The acrobatics could not be more exaggerated and outrageous. Perhaps this image "bigger than big" is attractive to Texans, but not for me or for anyone in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this end-of-career movie, except for Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson: do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie for video, even if you were desperate. It was about tricking the public to earn enough money after the opening day to match or do it better than it cost through marketing. They did it despite the fact that the public was warned. Stupidity abounds.
