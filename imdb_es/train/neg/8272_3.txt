At the end of "Dragon Heat", all I could think about was why it bothered me to go over everything. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is interesting and that, like Maggie Q, is what attracted me. To the movie in the first place. But I was disappointed sometime. Screenwriter and director Daniel Lee can not hold a candle for people like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the most annoying movies I've seen in my life. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style, and I use that incredibly relaxed phrase, which fills the film with completely unnecessary black and white photos, frozen images, slow motion, fast camera and other visual nonsense. I guess he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or a good dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are nothing special and they play like a music video more than anything else. There is not much to worry about any of the characters, including two supposedly professional snipers who could not hit the wide side of a barn from the inside. - who are then loaded with some of the cheesiest dialogues that I have seen in one of these Hong Kong activists. <br /> <br /> The plot lacks twists and turns - from the initial setup, everything unfolds in predictable fashion, and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the subsequent stories of the characters in case we have not obtained them the first times. This is a very amateur writing and movie making and wastes the talent of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. However, to be frank, I find it hard to remember that Biehn is in a good movie that was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great Hong Kong player, it's much better that you stay with some of the basic elements: "The Killer" by John Woo (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992), "City on Fire" by Ringo Lam (1987), which Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992), or his remake of "Point Blank" (1967), "Full Contact" (1992). Or even take a look at Yuen "So Close" (2002), a highly entertaining and yet absurd popcorn movie. And there is always the excellent activist of the French police, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> Right, most, if not all, are a bit exaggerated, but they were films that are still exciting, thrilling and even suspenseful. They have characters that interest us and amazing action sequences. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee has not made a bad action movie, he has made a boring one.
