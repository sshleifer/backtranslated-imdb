No way is this movie as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it just was not funny. He could not limit himself to one type of comedy: he jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to little man with great scores, to slapstick, to 'Loser' (the movie) types of comedies. Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (the fall of the hill), no one was particularly funny or exceptional in any way. The "Schindler's List" was more fun (and felt shorter). it was never known if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school, dropped out of college or simply a loser who lived at home with his mother, Sissy Spacek, in his worst role choice. And poor Ian McShane, THE serious actor, if only he had to name one, he's given a shit for reading on camera. The story drags and is completely predictable until and including the ending (there are no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Do not spend ANY money to watch this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will receive the suggestion and start producing quality films (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
