A very bad attempt at young spinal puncture. At least the music in the spine was good. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at its worst. A group of Hollywood executives, bad musicians and producers create a "poopie" show so that their children can be in the spotlight. Oh please!!! The bathroom mood was even bad. I hate these things when there are really incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who are struggling to succeed and this crap appears. <br /> <br /> Help us all! Why was not Gene Simmons in it? Ameriac's taste in entertainment is going to the bathroom.
