Admirably strange, though miserable dramatic comedy about a young stranger who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. The quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to crack from the start. Part of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a guide, and Sally Kellerman sees every inch of glamourpuss as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her !). At the head, Bud Cort is, once again, after "Harold & Maude", a true original; Not unpleasant as, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, insane and inoffensive, an act difficult to achieve. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's failures. You can put together a plaster and a masterpiece like nobody else, but let it light up with a wrong inspiration and spiral down. ** since ****
