This film was badly written, badly acted and very predictable. I had a very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went directly to the video. It was not even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could recover the 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot that has holes so big that you could drive a mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself had the young bride doing things she was not physically capable of doing, what an exaggeration! Skip this movie and see something better in the horror genre. Almost any movie comes to mind that is better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
