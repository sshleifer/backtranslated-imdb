Yes. I admit it. I believed all the enthusiasm that surrounded this work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City regarding their sexual lives. And, then, I really expected to see a Mexican movie (in ages) that was as popular as it was interesting to watch. Unfortunately the movie was completely disappointing. The story presents two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third party enters the life of each couple, their problems reach a fundamental point. Or absolute absurdity. The plot then becomes a battle of the sexes. The position adopted by each group (yes, literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly stupid and childish (I guess the humor was supposed to be there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job in his debut film. However, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc., make the film fail. Sadly. SPyL has had an (impressive) good reception at the box office. Create the bass drum at your own risk.
