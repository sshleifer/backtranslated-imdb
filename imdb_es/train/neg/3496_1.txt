I remember that my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching his age, I still remember him and I realize that I understand many of the things that my children love. But this is pathetic. I can not say I've seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as something special. But this show is far below what I expected from her. IMDb's writing made it sound like potential. Then, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off in half. Anything else is better than that. Jokes that are for a child of 5 years presented in a program for supposed adults. Well, Sarah, this adult is totally excited to turn you off. I can not believe that someone has financed this insult to comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes deposited here, saving other programs from such embarrassment.
