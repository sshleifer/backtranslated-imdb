I stole this movie when I was a freshman in college. I tried to see it three times, the second because the friends wanted to see it. "Honey, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny, it has to be funny." Incorrect! I can not make myself see this pile of trash after the boxing / insult fight, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes physical pain to your opponent. You might think that the terrible comedy that hurts you is ridiculous, but after seeing this you will know that it is true. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I've seen a lot of Steven Segal movies, and I've even seen Crossroads twice ... but I still could not see this.
