I watched this movie at its premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> As American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hope in Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of the countless films I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've wanted to leave before. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with Towelhead is that, obviously, it originates with a collection of "provocative" concepts related to cultural stereotypes, rather than an organic human drama. The script is derived from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous quote by Edith Wharton comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good despite being adapted to the author's political opinions. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because his political views are obsolete and simplistic. If ever there was a time when the white male villains of Towelhead, condescending black portraits, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's over. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, see. any of the many professional comments available online. Almost everyone qualifies this film poorly and exposes the superficial and manipulative tissue on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem more baffled. As you read the reviews on this and other similar sites, you will often encounter superlatives: "amazing", "awesome", "profound", "shocking", ... I'm ashamed to read them, but it's not like that. Surprise me In fact, I have met many people who seem to consider that any book or film that deals with racial, cultural, gender or sexual issues is profoundly moving, stimulating, full of deep insight. If you are such a person, rent Towelhead and move around it. On the other hand, if you set higher standards, you can safely pass it.
