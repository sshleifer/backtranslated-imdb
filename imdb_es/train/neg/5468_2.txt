I love the series 'Avenger TÃ³xico', but this weak offer from the people of Troma did not make any sense, and I had yawning all the time. <br /> <br /> A leaking nuclear plant (and the growing one next to it) makes the young people of Tromaville High go crazy, which causes them to join a gang, have sex, explode and what be. There is also some kind of monsters reproduction in high school ... My God, this movie is a disaster. <br /> <br /> The actors practically stopped their efforts after this and should do it. Overexpression (planned) started to irritate me in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 2/10.
