['An absolutely miserable movie waste !! Nothing ever happens There are no ghosts, almost no trains, no mystery, no interest. The constant and brutal comedy attempts are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a group of people stranded in the middle of nowhere, because their train stopped for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad does not leave them any place to stay, in a strong storm? I do not think so. Oh, you can walk 4 miles through the dead black fields. umm yes Of course. Or, they can force themselves on railroad hospitality and stay at the &quot;haunted&quot; train station. A station that proved to be nothing but MORTACULOSO, completely without ghosts, interest or plot. <br /><br /> So terribly boring that this seems impossible. <br /><br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list! aargh !!']
