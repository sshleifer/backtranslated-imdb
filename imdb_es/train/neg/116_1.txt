I can not believe that those who praise this movie are not thinking about another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that this was horrible, but the script (or the lack of it) makes for a movie that is also useless. On the positive side, the general level of craftsmanship on the part of the actors and the technical team is quite competent, but when you have a sow ear to work with, you can not make a silk bag. The fans of Ben G should stay with almost any other film that has been. Dorothy S fans should stay with Galaxina. Fans of Peter B must stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazing and terrible book, Killing of the Unicorn.
