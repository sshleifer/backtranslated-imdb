<br /> <br /> Take out your brewskies and enjoy this defective action movie. The considerable kempo ability of Speakman (good kicks, decent with sticks, poor sofa!) Is the only redeeming quality of a movie that only cries badly acting. The plot is not so bad; Simply executed pretty badly. But if you're watching this movie for more than martial arts, you're losing the boat altogether. And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown, very few Korean actors (even extras).
