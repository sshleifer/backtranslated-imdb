If this is a 2008 product from one of the largest production houses in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), I'm afraid we have a lot of ahead to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong at this length with a cast of stars as huge as Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then the creation of films has yet to be studied much more by all those associated with this film. The film is lacking in almost every department except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has some good dialogues to interpret, but that alone can not make you enjoy a movie with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car that goes down to a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of A cartoon movie. That in itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who is otherwise an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's trick of trying good English fails most of the time. And Saif will surely stick to himself thinking about why he signed this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, IT IS THE MAJOR RESIDUE OF RESOURCES AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a nicer movie than this one. <br /> <br /> One can not understand how and why this type of script was written and approved. Most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the faulty script, the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar has given only a few fill-in melodies to each song. The songs start very well and suddenly the melodies fall drastically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is a good thing of everyone in the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> With regard to the continuity intelligence of the creators, simply show this: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the mountainous area of ​​a foreign location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene they are looking for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the trap of her car. I'm still thinking who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit until the last moment, the climax is too long with stupid and unnecessary tricks. You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets that do not hurt as if they were GOD. Do we still watch a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved? So there are no more words about this pathetic and degraded film, but a sincere request to the main actors of his admirer. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar: If possible, request a preview of your films after your first copy. It is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and spectators. People still applaud when you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think that this type of film should not see the light of day, as it hinders the reputation of all those associated with the film, the actors and the production house.
