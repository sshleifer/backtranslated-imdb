Feeding the Masses is just one of the many recent mediocre zombie movies to chase your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your dollars earned and let's say the good old TheaterX took one for the team in this case. Guess what the plots are about? Zombies taking control. This time, however, for the sake of originality (?), This film takes place in Rhode Island and, to be honest, I'm not sure I've seen a zombie movie based in Rhode Island. A television station, controlled by the government, supposedly keeps the transmissions "normal" so that the remaining citizens do not think there is a problem in the world, that is, those who never look or go abroad, anyway. However, I will say that some of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most fun part of this movie. Actually, there is some history in this, but I do not bother with that because after a while you will not care or you will have fallen asleep. In any case, this has a lot of terrible performances to put on top of all the things that "have been seen before" that are trotted before the camera. Trust me, you can find many other things to do with your time than see this. 3 out of 10
