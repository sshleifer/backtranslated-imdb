This movie was a piece of confusing garbage. You never knew what was happening. The characters were badly written and for the most part they were totally unfriendly except for Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie, but in comparison to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) I should have won an award from the academy. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and sticky movie. All your life you have sunk to a completely new minimum. Someone has to make sure that this director never goes back to working on movies. It was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was so much more fun than terrifying. For shame for life, for shame.
