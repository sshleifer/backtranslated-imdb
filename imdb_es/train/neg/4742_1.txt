Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I saw the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and friends who is determined to be the queen of Homecoming. She is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and Shin helps her to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches him the skills of a snake, a tiger, etc. and he has to learn certain techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for children who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture. but the acting and the casting were horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comical actress and I can not see her playing a serious role. It was laughing funny laugh to see her cry for Shin. Shin could not act at all, and everything was totally incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and what I came up with was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the dangerous scenes were so powerful that Ranger-esquire was simply corny and stupid. The characters were not nice and I could not stand seeing them. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other films like Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, and Stuck in the Suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action adventures and jokes, you will like this movie.
