In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in their position are offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. I have no idea what Thomas was paid for doing this movie, but I would have to pay a lot of money to remember to make a national ridiculous movie. The movie obviously derives from "Enter The Dragon", as are most martial arts images. Only instead of a true martial art, they invent a new absurd martial art, accurately described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dance". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue a lady from an impenetrable fortress, but each room has an accessory that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the wicked assistants. Of course, he fights on his way to the main villain, and of course they have a fantasy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts movie. There are touches that nostalgic types will like, particularly the mullet cuts of Thomas and many of the male co-stars. But the only reason to see this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he had never set foot on the set of the movie.
