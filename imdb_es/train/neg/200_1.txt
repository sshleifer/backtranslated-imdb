That the critics liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a mess. The characters are made of wood. Michael Bowen spends most of the movie spying on the other characters and judging everyone wrong. No one has a quality of redemption or a point of interest. This is not nervous work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is not smart. There is nothing simple about this tedious work. That the theatrical premiere is lost is not surprising. Let the air of "This network" diminish that place. I definitely recommend moving to a repeat of the Garden Smart program on PBS or even good information if you find this mess on the nightly television. If you find him on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better having not suffered this chaos. Life is short. This movie is long
