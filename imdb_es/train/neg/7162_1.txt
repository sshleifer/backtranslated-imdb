This film takes what could have been a good idea, a 2,000 year old mummy witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry themselves. They're going to stay with her Nan and her uncle. The uncle has discovered a 2000-year-old witch kept in the mob. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. She can not be killed conventionally, (more is worth it). Nora, however, finds a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that has been made at a low cost. It is an expanding mess. I have to ask why someone would want to make such a bad movie. I am tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID AT ALL COSTS
