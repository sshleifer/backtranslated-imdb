The reason why I tried to give this film the opportunity to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and, hopefully, appreciate Indian cinema. All I've seen are few old S.Ray movies. <br /> <br /> Browsing through IMDb I came across this and after seeing a rating of 8.7, I came to the conclusion that this should be the one that will open the doors of the unknown. and bring artistic enjoyment. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this classification of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted are from India and their only venture out of Bolliwood's production were the Adam Sandler films. <br /> <br /> With this classification, this film would be ranked ninth on the IMDb List of the 250 best films about Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing worth remembering about this painful experience. My only hope is that there are a lot of Hindus who, like me, find this movie as it is: completely stupid, with plenty of kitsch and cheesy music.
