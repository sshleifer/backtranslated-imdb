Well, damn it, MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like this cheap and cheesy parody of the 70s. The idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the US. UU It's a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie provides some decent giggles, seeing the terrified extras flee from the big, obviously fake tomatoes. This movie, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the previous attempts at fakes, which became so popular in the 80s and 90s, thanks in large part to Airplane! This, like the parodies of most of the time, is quite poor. Many attempts at humor are sad failures, and will cause many moans. But thanks to the ravenous hordes of tomatoes, the hateful song "Puberty Love" and the amazing scene of the helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes provides some products, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There are so many things wrong with this movie ... and of course, it's hard to explain. Enough people must have also enjoyed it since the Tomatoes returned in 2 Moore movies and a cartoon series! Big chunks of time that go by outside the tomatoes are pretty boring. And dig those 70's clothes, dude! ; = 8) This tomato is shabby and with cheese, but it's worth a giggle or two; The MooCow says he takes a pizza and stuffs the tomatoes! : ??
