This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds' theory about "Weapons, germs and steel", explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs that covered 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond watching the birds through the binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond can not use the bow and arrow correctly, Professor Jared Diamond is shooting an abuser. Was this documentary supposed to be a hero of "Professor Jared Diamond?" This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a parody. The worst was when Diamond is shown breaking and crying while walking through the malaria room in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "Weapons, germs and steel." By the way, "Guns, germs and steel" is said about 100 times. "Can Europeans, weapons, germs and steel bring them out of this terrible situation? Stay tuned and discover!" When he finally gets to work, his theory is equally interesting and completely boring. The Europeans conquered the native peoples of other lands, because they had fine weapons and knives against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a teacher to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how Europeans came to have the advantages that allow conquest are interesting, but the coverage is very thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I know. If I am a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me with his clumsy use of native implements. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the expected audience for this documentary. However, children can enjoy this more than me. I have read that the book of which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
