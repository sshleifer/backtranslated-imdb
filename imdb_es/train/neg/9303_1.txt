I am writing this review after having seen it several months ago ... the trailer seemed promising enough for me to buy this bad excuse for a movie. It is a complete joke ... and, literally, a spit in front of the real classics of the previous generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), that even had the gall to compare with the back of the cover. The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve greasy burgers ... hell, he could not be good at that either! The lighting was bad bad bad and a great annoyance throughout the movie sometimes you could not even see the actor's faces. I do not even remember the rest of the cast members, which is really sad, but they never do anything to impress them and make them memorable. That's all the time I'll waste in this review. PLEASE, stay as far as possible from this pile of garbage, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not do it. Buy a chewing gum at least That would keep him entertained! <br /> <br /> If you want a low-budget fun of good quality, much better than this ... then check out a Jeff Hayes movie ... because talent is needed to succeed and the child have! <Br /> <br /> I gave this star 1 just for the art of the cover ... that's the only thing worth to like about this so called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
