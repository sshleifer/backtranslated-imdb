There are several things wrong with this movie, one of them is the character of Brenda Song. I do not think the girl is a bad actress, honestly not. I think they give you bad lines. It's supposed to just be "that vain, rich girl", and although it's fun in the TV shows where she plays, I can not even get a dry laugh out here. <br /> <br /> Or well, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chases you and orders you to wear a medallion and insists that they needed you to fight "the great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know that this movie is completely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in Wendy's family line were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks would have been fine with that. Sure, maybe they could have worked it somehow, but they offered no explanation. In doing so, they only contributed to the numerous attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> However, however, let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes More unbearable as the movie progresses. Yes, she is a teenager, and she is close to returning home. I mean, who wants to fight evil during the return home? The problem is that when "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy does not seem as scared as she should be. She is extremely careless, even for someone like her. She still does not worry about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will take over and all good things will disappear." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure ... Well ... let's talk about something else". Yes, let's go to Wendy. We are also going to dance when you should be training. Of course Shen leaves her, but her character has an excuse. Better that he cooperate with her, that he does not, and that she does not train at all, and that they kill both of them. <br /> <br /> Oh, talking about that. Shen also told Wendy that his fate was for him to die for her in the battle, as he had done for his great-grandmother (I assume that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> As the screenwriter would, the return to Wendy's house and this "great battle" unfold exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she ends up going to battle, because when she tries to go home, the monks (whom Shen had trapped in the body of her trainer and teachers because "she felt weird fighting an old man") inform her that Shen has gone to the battle alone, so she's going to save him. <br /> <br /> Initially we see a half decent fight, which is actually entertaining. Until finally, the great evil leaves the body of Wendy's rival for the return home and creates the real incarnation of himself from the broken pieces of the bodies of his former warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets "terrified". Then Shen goes and defends her like this, forgive me for forgetting her long Chinese name, and she manages to get him killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen while he makes his long descent be pushed uncomfortably high in the air. <br /> <br /> She screams the title of that article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became too powerful, too fast. No, I will not let her be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within her". <br /> <br /> Since when, however, have you learned how to heal? No, the worst ... how long could it resurrect people? So Shen is resurrected from the dead. Then, Wendy and he fight with the boy. <br /> <br /> Lose too easily. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks praise Wendy for her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, number 1: Do not the scriptwriter and the director know that a battle needs something more "delicacy"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she has not gone home? Because the girl did not sweat, she did not even bleed. I mean, come on, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... keep going. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds Like maybe I should have given the movie one, based on my comments. However, you should know that part of the criticism is breaking a thing. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you pay attention. This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when, in the first place, you never expect something to be too good. <br /> <br /> Then, I guess everything was fine. It is not that he did not say that it was not right, he would not have prevented anyone from seeing him.
