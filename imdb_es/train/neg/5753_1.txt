... although for a movie that seems to be trying to promote itself as a horror, there was a clear lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of direction, acting, editing and script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London performed one of the most frightening performances I've ever seen: his "descent into maelstr√∂m" of madness is painfully clumsy and self-conscious. Oh look at him tremble! Oh, look at him, drink strong spirits! Oh, look at it, raise your forehead and lift your head in a cheerful angle! Oh, look at her dark, greasy hair without washing! Oh, listen to your affected and hoarse voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the poet's shirt comes out, it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe). Oh, for the love of ... Did someone give this guy a handbook on "How to Act Well" or did they just pull it out of a cardboard box somewhere, the missing little plastic prize toy in a discontinuous way? Bargain cereal brand. Well, that was a stupid line, but only because the London performance has melted my brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but she still has to grow up in her acting shoes. this movie - she pronounced her lines as if they were holding her, in fact, all her performance was very wooden, her postures as rigid as her lines - who knows, maybe she was just reacting and trying to neutralize, Jeremy London's weakening excesses, but if that is the case, she takes it too far. <br /> <br /> Remarkable is Arie Verveen as Poe, while the role of his character is confusing, he offers the best performance of the piece. He, simply, looks good, but it's more than that: he has some kind of depth, he thought he had a life beyond the sad two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Poe, and so I could let my mind wander and invent while he was on the screen. Whatever it is, it had an interest factor that is not otherwise found. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless blur: there are all the usual caricatures: the happy friend of the best friend who is a bit lazy; the wounded local policeman who is a bit of an idiot; the older protective man who perhaps has too much nonpaternal interest in our heroine; the intriguing old witch, etc., etc., yawns, yawns. <br /> <br /> As with the problem of 'lack of blood for a horror film', none of the themes they mention (and which the London character mentions, so scathingly, in his attack on writing of Poe) is followed. in. As another critic said: here there was potential: murder, incest, really shocking things, but instead they avoid problems and move away from violence (a tall candelabrum that sways in the air) approaches its victim. --- Cut to black! This is fine in a traditional Noirish horror, in fact, it is expected, and it is received with affection when it happens - it is a very dear convention, especially when accompanied by false lightning and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but in 'Descendant' you see clumsy, or as if the publisher had got dizzy at the last moment and had eliminated it.) This could have been a very tense psychological thriller (the horror of palingenesis / delirium / madness) or a simple (and funny) slasher movie: it tries to be both, or none (something new and exciting!), but in any case it fails in a disastrous way. The only element of horror of this whole movie is its epic dullness. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there was one) must have been drunk when he / she cut this thing; Scenes scenes that seemed out of order (but that could have been the poor script). Like the director and the director of photography, there were some very strange shots and frames that I think were meant to be tributes to Hitchcock or Browning, but they ended up looking stupid (again, well in a noir, but this was trying to be another thing). ) <br /> <br /> It may have been all funny (in that way that previous critics have mentioned "My God, how was this done?!?") if I had been in the mood for a bit of junk - Bagged, unfortunately for me, I had settled on the sofa, with the lights low, with the express intention of scaring myself. This is a very bad movie, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to people, not even for laughter. <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time or your money on this, do not borrow a real suspense or horror movie, or find yourself a copy of Poe's fantastic stories. I will have a much more pleasant and terrifying night than I could ever hope for with this garbage.
