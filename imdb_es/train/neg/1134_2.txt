As a Danish, I am proud of the good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. However, it is a pity that this increase in quality has led most of the Danish film critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any review of Danish films and, as a result, I have stopped seeing them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know it's a mistake to sustain this unfortunate development against any one movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible movie under any circumstances. The fact that it was criticized by critics has just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with the Danish film. Also, waiting until it came out on DVD was of little help against the unwavering feeling of having wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a gift for social realism in the Copenhagen environment. I particularly enjoyed "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, it is usually fun, although in general he plays the same role in all his films, namely, that of a working-class bum who has bad luck, partly because he is vague but mainly by society, and that he redeems himself. doing something good for your community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one problem in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen presents himself as a chicken breeder, which is a break from the norm that never manages to make it credible. <br /> <br /> However, it is much worse that the film has to go around and around and break all the rules of how to tell a story so that the audience understands what is happening. For example, the film begins with a sad attempt to visualize the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and poor camera work. After that, the character tells his best friend that he suddenly felt the need to jump off a bridge. This is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen resorts to the lowest way of communicating any motivation that exists: counting instead of showing. Therefore, at any given moment, you have a character who speaks aloud to a supposedly catatonic person about how he feels, because the script would not allow him to represent his feelings; and later, the voice-over is abruptly introduced, possibly as a last-minute idea, to convey feelings that would otherwise be unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude. Fortunately, at this point you spent about an hour worrying about any of the characters, not to mention the so-called story. <br /> <br /> The performance, which has often been a problem in Clausen's films, can be summed up in a sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to stardom was as a participant in Big Brother, is not worse than several of the actors announced in the cast. <br /> <br /> I give this a rating of 2 out of 10.
