I have been reviewing the list of the best 100 comedies of the AFI, and I must say that this is really one of the worst. Not only from the 90 films on the list that I've seen, but from any movie I've seen. Drunks are fun sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza almost made it worthwhile, but unfortunately ... go see Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, is Dudley supposed to be laughing and drinking fun? I would highly recommend almost ANY movie in the best 100 AFI comedies for more laughter than this. If you want to see a more fun "drunk", try The Thin Man. The funniest film in general, any movie of the Marx Brothers will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
