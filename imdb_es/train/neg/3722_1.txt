I remember being forced (yes, literally FORCED) to watch this movie by a Southern Baptist Preacher when I was a child, and I still loved his horror. It is designed to scare poor suckers into being "saved." The only thing that "saved" me was the fact that it finally ended and that I could go out and have a REAL life. <br /> <br /> Check out the chapter in this movie in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of Christian Law." FASCINATING. And certainly more interesting than the movie!
