Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a small cartoon series with a lot of joke from Bush (but recharged and overloaded). Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was absolutely pathetic. Aside from Cheney's joke that he ate chicken, and some laughs, it was really boring and not funny. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the Flash Project of a thirteen-year-old child. It is shameful that they have used Macromedia's product for this, because it is capable of much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush very much, and I enjoy both Bush's joke and the next guy, but this was just a half-hour blow to the President with several painfully amusing moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the short comedy "That's My Bush." Thank you
