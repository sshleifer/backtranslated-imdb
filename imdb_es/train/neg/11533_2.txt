If yours are the predictable and predictable thrivers of revenge and rape, then a weird whim waits for you ... I'm not really attracted, so I could not find anything to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something out of the 1980s, a different time when this would have gone directly to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing when she gets involved with a movie like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? It is said that the director was influenced by witnessing a nearby rape and by his work in documentaries, but even that is not an excuse for the strange scene in which a group of hunting dogs hit Dyer. I do not think I was the only person in the movies laughing. What I can not understand is the participation of the companies behind this film: FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road: Straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned at the same time. FilmFour and Verve take note: is it really the best you can do? What will British filmmakers do independent of your artistic judgment? It's a big stain on both reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of independent British movie fans crying in despair?
