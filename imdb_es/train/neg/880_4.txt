Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at the "modern day" of Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first effort as a director since the 1940s! David Janssen is as bad as the owner of a large casino that meets with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches all the scenes in the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Janssen is asking too much for this character who is calm and carefree, who barks at everyone like a grumpy husband (he even bites Don Rickles and makes him cry). His son, who does nothing to find his own identity, makes fashionable comments about how young people see Vegas (giving them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has some fun as a dancer at an audition. Unfortunately, "Where It's At" does not have much more than that, apart from the reflections on ethics between adults and their children, some quick T & A shots and funny satirical snippets about the world of gambling. most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** since ****
