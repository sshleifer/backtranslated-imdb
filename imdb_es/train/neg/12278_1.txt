When watching this program, he is not entirely sure if the story or the acting is more annoying. First, the story of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used all possible clich√©s, you can guess not only the general plot, but also the arrangement of the scenes and the lines of each character, which makes the show is of some kind. of a collage of all the police series that there are. At the top of all this comes the "message" of the show, that the good is good and the bad is bad and that at the end of the day the good will prevail and we should all love each other, be better men and men. Better citizens, all done in the most obvious way. The actors, like the vehicles of this message and nothing else, will use a limited set of acting skills: the "I'm a good carrier" smile, the worried look and body posture of "victory is ours", while the bad guys have the look of "I'm a bad guy" and the look of "caught me", followed by the headbands of "I'm good for nothing and should be eliminated from society" (this also sums up the development general of each show). True story or not, the program is garbage, another proof that the producers do not care about the spectators, that we are all idiots. Well, this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains of you.
