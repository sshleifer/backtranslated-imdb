this became a cult movie in Chinese university students, although I have not seen it until it airs on channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> Filled with pretensions of artistic dizziness, the plot is mediocre and unreal; the "spirit" he wants to convey is how independent artists "oppose the commercialization of the music industry" and maintain their "purity of artistic soul" and not "sell for dirty money". That is really dizzying and superficial. The diologos are mainly pathetic. acting is poor Sceenplay is full of pretentious art. it's a fantasy movie for kids and that's it <br /> <br />
