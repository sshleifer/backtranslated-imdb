I watched the movie last night and really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie had been going up and down since I heard it was being made. Some days I would see something spectacular and some days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, being the kind of fan that I am, I had high hopes in this movie, but in the end I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I love Richard Donner movies, I did not like his sometimes corny nature or the changes they made to the Superman character and his powers. <br /> <br /> Singer, however, opted to take the worst elements of Donner's movies and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is a little darker, he is still no more than a shy, a swindler and a common criminal. It is not smarter than when Gene Hackman interpreted it. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but ultimately he is the victim of poor quality writing and uncomplicated dialogue. <br /> <br /> His henchmen are more two-dimensional than even comic book henchmen. Most of them, literally, do not have any dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Mrs. Tesmacher. She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor, but she proves to be just a subordinate who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and, as expected, betrays Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment of the film was Frank Langella. Perry White. He was not a big Perry White fan in Donner movies, but at least he had a soul. After all, it was said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing more than a corporate puppet. He wants everyone to concentrate on stories related to Superman because they sell papers even though everyone else does the same. He does not care about real stories, real mysteries like fainting and what Lex Luthor is doing now that he's out of jail. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that it is FLUFFY! Some actors can be calm and sober and, nevertheless, have a hidden current that lets them know that the waters are still deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It's fine, but again there's not a single memorable line in the whole movie. It is not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look elegant, as if the lighter movement of his fingers affected the way he flies. But it still seems choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, though poorly written, was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager in Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpower, he manages to decipher Lois Lane's message, flies a plane to the place, climbs aboard Luthor's yacht and rescues Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the film is when the whole pantry is trapped as it is flooded with water and the ship is sinking. You see them submerging slowly in the water. You know that Superman will come at the last moment to rescue them but still you can not help feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Unlike what Singer said, this is not a movie about a superhero who returns and tries to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world receives him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him again. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him the opportunity to solve the problem with the steel man. <br /> <br /> It shows that Superman is probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. A large green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of prison, he now has knowledge about Superman's powers and weaknesses, and he still can not connect the dots enough to know that Luthor would use Kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the only thing Superman is good at is lifting really heavy things. The action sequences are incredibly predictable.
