Despite the acclaim on the cover of the DVD of the version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war movies of the time that describes the mud, boredom and frustration of the growl, but unfortunately, one goes away thinking that this is ALL there is in this film. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie has to have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best movies of the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has very little action. But it compensates with cracking dialogues and psychological tensions. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a brief battle segment (titled "city in a state of siege" on the DVD) that takes place in Italy. It is true that it is one of the fastest and most convincing combat scenes of any war movie. But, unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth seeing just for this highlight. Another detour is the Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is destined to be a "romeo" but comes out of a pervert. On the contrary, the sergeant. Warnicki is a nice man, although defective. As he tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: "Every step forward is one step closer ... from home." But that last step? a patrol too much ?? it takes it by the mental edge. It's a pity that the rest of the movie does not do justice to some fine touches. As for Meredith's portrayal of Pyle ... she's practically comatose.
