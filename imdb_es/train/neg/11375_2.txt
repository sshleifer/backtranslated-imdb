You're talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring a guy I've never seen before or since he plays a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor. He has a heavy weight for Taxi Driver when he tries to use that trick to make it big. When he learns the concrete facts of life, he does what others do, he changes his image! Go from being a good friend to a surf guy at night. His friend can not believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and has an excellent paid concert). Can this young punk maintain his credibility on the street while making it big? <br /> <br /> This is a really boring movie that tries too much to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to a bad execution. Who knows, maybe someone picks up the ball and runs because the filmmakers twisted it this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
