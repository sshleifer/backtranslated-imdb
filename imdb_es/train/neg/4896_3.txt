I will start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (as long as the translation was good :), the choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and the kitchen scene. <br /> <br /> But that's it. <br /> <br /> I understand it, artistic cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too quiet (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of listening steps and moans from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should be boring, no matter how deep it is!), Too many scenes pornographic (I really understand, I understand that they were filming a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, really that's too much) I really think that the cinema should be to watch and this definitely can not be seen in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
