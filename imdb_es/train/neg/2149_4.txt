Well, the great money machine has done it again! Disney takes advantage with cunning of imbeciles like me, who believe that we must have all the videos (good or bad) with the nickname of Disney. Why do I continue to wait for these "sequels" that make Don Bluth look like Leonardo Da Vinci on a bad day? Cinderella 2 has three stories (it's a bad choice!). Does not one of Disney's most attractive creations deserve at least a linear story? Of these three, only the last one is close to the quality of animation and narration that I would expect. The music is atrocious and modern (that is, in 2 years it will be dated) and it does not add anything to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original caricature is still popular due to its timelessness, so why not be respectful and faithful to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can not wait for a sequel to The Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we will get music inspired by Britney Spears. So, Disney, if you're listening, remember that we're not all indiscriminate children here. How about throwing a bone or two at the fans who have been around long enough to know the difference between craftsmanship and shit?
