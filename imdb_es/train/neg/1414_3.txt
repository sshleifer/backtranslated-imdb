After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it with Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I could immediately see the point of the critics. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt at a similar subject. Interestingly, the format of the film is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 elements" takes the viewer to the 1 day timeline of the movie, while the "Best in ..." plan seems to extend for a few long days. <br /> <br /> I 'm sure some people will see this because they have Morgan Freeman and they will be disappointed. It seems that their best roles today are supporting roles in blockbuster box office hits, rather than leading roles in limited release films and independent films under $ 10 thousand.
