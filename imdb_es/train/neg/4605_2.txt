This film is written by Charlie Higson, who before this made the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of the characters of Fast Show (Tony the car salesman). He has also written James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> Actually, I've seen before that only Gordon's films are based on Lovecraft stories, and each of them is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means trembling camera, fast and strange cuts, cool background chillout music. It works pretty well here, I suppose, but it's still useless and cheap. It makes me think often of the cameraman who is shaking his video camera in front of the actors / actresses and tries to make elegant movements in the photos (hoping that something tolerable comes out). The casting is good, and there is a complete environment, which is the result of a good direction. I think the main character, the "zero" guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". The fat one is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but it's not him. But shortly after the beginning, the film turns out to be something not so interesting: in this case I am referring to an endless line of scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: it is totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and desperate, or soon dies. Needless to say, there is no humor either. It is a long vomit of 1'40 without relief at any time. Anyway, Gordon is still for me one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think of this film as an experiment, and as a failure in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost once in a while, just to learn and find their way again. This could be Gordon's most disinterested and empty job.
