In short: the movie is boring. The cliché on cliché is confirmed and the lines of the story never come together. It seems as if the director is not sure whether to make a film or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent receives the order to kill an oil prince, is caught and then warns the prince (why?)) And, therefore, some elements were added to make the movie is more interesting. Then, a child dies, which results in the father's "natural" response: to freely advise the person indirectly responsible for the death of their child. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and keeps him close, because no one knows. Some children become suicide bombers and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I did not laugh or cry, I did not get an understanding nor was I forced to learn more or to take a cause. It did not mean anything to me, which in my opinion is the worst thing that can be said about a movie.
