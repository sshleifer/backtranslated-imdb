We went to the movie with a group because the work we were going to was canceled. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies in history. It's not that I do not like cult movies that I do. But nothing happens in the movie. One does not feel any connection with the characters at all. Endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do they carry a huge tent and beds with chairs and clothes for every day in that car? It's a two-seater! I have to say that, however, the landscape is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have done a photo session of the film, so that we can skip about 80 minutes of useless time without anything happening. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it, since it is a waste of time
