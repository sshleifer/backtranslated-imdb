If another Hitler emerges, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this movie, which propagates the absurd idea that he was a madman visibly mad from the start. Far from following such a person and choosing him for the highest position on earth, healthy people would cross the street to avoid it, and he would have died in a ditch, without a name and without a name. <br /> <br /> Anybody The stories of Hitler's close associates, like the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge, for example, will be impressed by the fact that people found him a kind, intelligent and generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem exaggerated and ranting to modern ears ignores the times when they were made, when the pomposity of the prop was common in political speeches. The same is true of the exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was not even a central plank of the first Nazis, which were mainly anti-communist, neither rare or unusual for the time. The film gives the impression that Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person who will kill tens of millions, you can ignore those who care for the little ones. Life is portrayed here. Instead, look for a charming and charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work benefits the country in a visible and material way. I am afraid that his personality will be much more similar to that of Barack Obama than to that of Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot here and had nothing but caricature. The fools who did this committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of 'Reefer Madness'.
