I have seen the original version in unbent German and I was surprised at how bad this movie is. Thinking that I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and nothing else, nothing could have prepared me for this! It really was a pain to sit through this movie, since there is no argument, no good acting and even special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, who wear nothing but white makeup and their old clothes, so Your good set would not be ruined by ketchup and jam stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then look at it, for everyone else, do not do it, because you will regret it!
