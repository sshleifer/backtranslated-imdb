"A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's best musicals. But even Astaire's bad movies always had some good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal tour. Meet Lady Alice Marshmorton (19 years old, Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who gets into a taxi she is taking to escape a crowd of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. She tries to rescue her from her family's farm, but soon discovers that the house staff is betting that the suitor Lady Alice will get married. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the noted butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the cranky of the house, each turn alternately help and sabotage Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This The musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and annoying. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure the interminable and annoying scenes of (a) Fred, who has an affair with Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conspire with each other and with each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the boy in the house are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional villainous characters, the kind of people you just want to bang in the mouth. You want them to leave the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of her regular partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a mediocre and dazzling lady in this movie, and it's a disaster in a musical. She has little in her favor, in terms of her character, apart from her adorable face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are on their way, as Jerry's publicist and his secretary. The duo adds some much needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some fun lines, but sometimes it's also very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of the George Stevens movie is not well done. Sometimes, the cinematography is horrible and unfocused. There are a series of outdoor scenes on extremely cloudy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie). On the positive side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are incredible, and have become standards of classic songs. And, of course, the dance in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and her choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the musical and dance numbers are misused and are not on stage. Sometimes, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the serpentine plot. (At one point, the butler leaves the mansion and gets into an operetta solo for no clear reason). The numbers include:  "I'm dancing and I can not be bothered now" - Fred dances well on a foggy London street full of traffic. He makes a big "cane spin" with a rolled umbrella, but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You," Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) <br /> <br />  "Put me to the test" - Fred, George and Gracie do a dance trio in an English cabin. George and Gracie coincide step by step with Fred, but the number ends poorly and everyone kicks each other for no reason. <br /> <br />  "Rigid upper lip" (The Fun House Number) - In a fun at a House amusement park, Fred, George and Gracie have fun dancing on the rotating floor, spinning the barrel and with the Funny mirrors of the house. It's the best number in the movie, but sometimes it's a bit repetitive. <br /> <br />  "Things are getting better": Fred and Joan Fontaine make their only dance number together in the film, circling the back woods of the stately estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "A foggy day in the city of London": Fred wanders through the fog of the manorial estate at night, singing about the foggy day When he met Joan in London. Sometimes, it seems as if he is not sure which way he will take in the fog, like the musical number itself. <br /> <br />  "Good job if you can get it": a great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event in the manor house, Fred gets involved in a chorus of serious-face singers who sing this song at random. Every time Fred joins, the other singers look at him as if they wanted him to leave. (Once again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You").  "Drum dance number": While Fred and Joan are running away, Fred has to stop and make a final tap dance number while hitting a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there is no need to do it, except to prolong the movie. <br /> <br /> The most artificial moment of the film occurs when Fred decides to jump from a stone balcony on the rural estate to show his love. For Joan Fontaine. When you jump off the balcony, find a trapeze conveniently located, like a * trapeze *, hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or, rather, a specialist in Fred's clothes) takes the trapeze and sways on the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth it on DVD just for the dance numbers, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on his remote control. The >> FF button lets you jump through the other boring scenes in the movie to get to the dance numbers.
