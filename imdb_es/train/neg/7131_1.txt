I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and copy them for their duration. Then there are abominable movies like this. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a revealing sign that perhaps the American film industry should please, for the sake of the viewer, at least review the scripts before funding a movie. <br /> <br /> If a stereotype will make a decision. Shit, this movie would spawn of that. The plot is unbearable, and acting in general is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a long time, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and be beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street traders (almost the only thing for which they can legitimately qualify). Also, how Angus Macfadyen was convinced to make this film is so far from me that I can not even think of an analogy. I am a loyal fan of him, but this has made me question him. <br /> <br /> To summarize. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you are a person bigger than me), so much that it becomes violence (I suppose). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in the sense that it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not suitable for human ears. This movie is essentially a big car commercial for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest, should be avoided at any cost. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find a positive aspect in this movie, and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits will be shot. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie, then you are a hack and I hope that old age makes you havoc. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie looking for a laughable experience, listen to the lyrics of the incredible songs by Nadia Bjorlin.
