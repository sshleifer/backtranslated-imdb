Why, oh, why can no one make a decent movie from a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" that has disappointed me in a year. But I have to say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to this one. That was just a little disappointing. This is a disaster! <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most? Were the useless elements of the plot that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifice, meaningless love interest?), Or the bad CGI, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired performance? Worse still was the way they made the beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible! And we do not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why did they remind us continuously that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet never showed the slightest sign of such force throughout the film? He was defeated by the two monsters he fought with, trusting his companions to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he did not knock him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more similar. This certainly was not the mighty Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this on a positive note but I really can not think of a single hand. All I can say is that, if you have ever read "Beowulf", you will be infinitely disappointed by this grim and inaccurate excuse for an adaptation!
