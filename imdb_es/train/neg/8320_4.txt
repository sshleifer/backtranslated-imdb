After watching Awake, I came to a conclusion: director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of making fun of the viewer, for the simple fact that the movie is full of ridiculous elements. Awake has many plot holes and is full of absurd and ridiculous Elements (for example, the hospital uniform that uses the spirit of the main character ... the ghost of a doctor left him on the floor?). The concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious, but all the holes in the plot and the absurd things make this a stupid and horrible movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad interpretations. There is an expression of zero in the singers of Alabama. The same applies to Jessica Alba. The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is greatly wasted in his role. Awakening makes the viewer laugh. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this fucking movie.
