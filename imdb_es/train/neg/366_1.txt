Bad actors, bad filming, choppy dialogue, shallow characters, but, again, it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, a moronic criminal gives a blank check to an 11-year-old boy who is harassed because he has very little money. Of course, the 11-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, collect a check for $ 1,000,000 and even frustrate three clumsy idiots, who remember the three puppets. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying and nasty boy who decides that, when a complete stranger writes it on a blank check, he will take advantage of the situation as best he can. In other words, he goes into a bank, <br /> <br /> gives a cashier a check he makes on his printer, and miraculously comes out with a million dollars in cash. Apparently, Preston is also able to reach incredible speeds on his bike, due to the fact that a man who drives a Jaguar after Preston and his speed of 10 could not catch him, even when Preston jumped into a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every Hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroin. In this case, our hot heroine is an FBI agent who attacks children and goes out with Preston, eleven years old, and promises her another date when she turns 17. <br /> <br /> However, the worst aspect of this movie was not his casting. , nor his careless dialogue, such as "The only other way I could think about skinning a cat is to put a hose on his butt and then pick up the hair." It was, rather, the whole fact that nobody in the whole movie seemed to realize that the FBI does not care about people at random. What I could not explain is that Preston uses the alias "Macintosh" to pose as a type of entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine to Preston, who uses her 11-year-old wit to scream first when the locusts fall on her face, then they invite her to hamburgers, ending with a ridiculous offspring through a cemented area where Jettison water is from the ground. Our heroine does not realize during this whole adventure that the criminal pursuing the FBI is sliding and sliding just behind the two, as they head for Preston's limousine, complete with a one-dimensional driver who never fails the time to provide the third cheap class. He laughs that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> In general: 1/10 is incredibly kind to this movie. I do not see how he only has a 4.4 / 10.
