Three stories are told in this film, which seems to have been filmed without knowing that it is a combined vignette film. The manufacturers link the three cartoons connecting them all with Martin Kove, although you never see any of the contacts with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette has the sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who fears everything under the sun (makes Adrian Monk look brave), having a night of paranoia alone at home. You will literally yell at Vivian for doing some ridiculous things. He spends most of his time in a nightgown that shows off his incredible features. But his movie is the worst, if not the most scathing. <br /> <br /> The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton while portraying the roommate of Hell. His roommate geek allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny, since a man fears that death will take him at any time, like his friend. who drowned to death in an olive. <br /> <br /> It is not very interesting, since the film as a whole seems to be united with very little thought. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
