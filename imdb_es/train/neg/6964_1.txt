I usually check out the MTV movie awards to see an ingenious and entertaining program that offers a unique prize program (Chewbacca, for example, earns an award for a lifetime achievement). So this year was not different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny, stupid and stupid, to me. I laughed at Stiffler in the two American Pie films, and I even enjoyed it at Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherent, fun or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should devote himself to singing and dancing; I'm sure he can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to know who the writers of this program were. Last year's performance of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (only the parody of The Lord of the Rings was worth seeing the whole show), but this year was completely different. Someone understood Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're watching a movie together, but they never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke have just entered into their boring dialogue, never making a reference to the "joke" of Timberlake. And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, he did not even make me smile, but he just laughed. And what was the point of the Harrison Ford phrases? Did they make any sense to someone? Maybe the MTV writers thought that the young viewers would only know the old Ford like Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the President of Air Force One. I'm confused. And someone would tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how many years do you think he has? The guy seems to be 30 years old, he's trying to act 19 again ... give up, show a little class (as in his award speech from the best acting academy) and act at his age. of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for Better visual performance. This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the whole night.
