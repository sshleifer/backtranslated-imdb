The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took away the film so much that it almost made it incomprehensible. The basic elements such as the development of the character were overlooked, at best. The inconsistencies also raised their heads ugly. A massive mansion in the middle of the Irish countryside? Do the characters simply "appear" in the gardens during a stormy night (at convenient times, could I add)? In general, it was not "bad". I rated it with a 4, based mainly on the history and talent of Alison Elliott.
