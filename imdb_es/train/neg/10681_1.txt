How unfortunate, having so many of my "a" list and good actors from the "b" list agree to make this movie, but they did, and that's what attracted me to watch it. I had never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the cover of the DVD, and James Woods in the background, how bad could it be? In a word very! This movie starts o.k. It has some twists and turns, then it just lays an egg. The ending was so weak, it was as if the writer was called and his 4-year-old son sat on the type writer and cut the ending. How ironic it is that a movie called "The Final Game" has such a poor game. These are the types of movies that can move actors from the "a" list to the "b" list quickly. I hope that Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not make a habit of this.
