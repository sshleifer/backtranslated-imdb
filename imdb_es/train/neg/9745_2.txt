This movie is faked in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was at its best when this movie was started. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, bad makeup, bad effects, chick in tiny underwear (60s). I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of the makeup. The assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like NACHOO !! (thinks sneeze) It is just a bad prayer. The long eyebrows are hilarious in one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what 'The Projected Man' means in terms of the plot. Although I missed something from the beginning. <br /> <br /> What happens with this minimum of 10 lines in the publication?
