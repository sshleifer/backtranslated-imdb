A while ago, I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors, Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now he is the husband and Jude Law is the lover of his wife. The story remains the same and it is a fantastic work. <br /> <br /> During the film I always had the feeling of seeing a work. That's one of the reasons why I do not like this remake of a classic. When I see a film adapted to a work, I still have to feel that I see a film and not just a work. Director Kenneth Brannigan did some wonderful movies in the past, but this time he got lost. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, elegant, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never had the feeling that someone lived in that house. The photography was not bad, but the lighting was horrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark light, green, to round it is not friendly to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The acting was really good. Those of Michael Caine and Jude Law perform in the best way. I would really like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. But I must confess that I was never a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that in the original this part was still very mysterious and was wonderfully directed. I tried to see it twice and always in the middle part I fell asleep. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not horrible, but it seems to be more a film for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
