It is difficult to put into words with precision how terrible this film is. A completely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything remotely recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in "Rabbit Testing." So, as a small contribution to this future endeavor, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; I used to describe debacles that were too ambitious like the movie "Rabbit Test". <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and the producer of "Hollywood Squares", Jay Redack, have far exceeded their limited abilities to have fun in this 82-minute misery festival. Trying to put together an airplane! Comedy style with a moldy collection of gags, (Note to Joan: German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville) dug up from their graves in the Catskills: it's bad enough. But the composition of this cinematic crime is River's directional style, which can best be described as "ugly", and a cast of yesteryear characters for the future so eager to please that they exaggerate even the weakest gags. <br /> <Adrift, in this Sargasso Sea of ​​sap, Billy Crystal is in his debut role in the cinema as the hapless protagonist of the movie Lionel. Seeing Crystal in this picture is a lot like seeing a blind person take a ride in a minefield; finally, the shrunken reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition, as a cheap joke after a cheap joke explodes in your face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate about the type of audience that would really like Rabbit Test. Cabbages, molluscs and lizards with slight delay are all likely candidates. But for conscious and self-aware human beings: I strongly recommend pouring bleach into your eyes before recommending "Rabbit Testing".
