I like monster movies, in general. Even if they are unlikely and foolish. But it's hard for me to like this movie when it's so unlikely and silly. And try to take it seriously at the same time. As in a really elegant way. <br /> <br /> While the idea is somewhat objective, as killer whales are known to kill the Great White Sharks, it's really hard to find fear when I can not help it, I only see An angry Shamoo destroying things. Especially that scene in which a building exploded due to the action of the Orca ... and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt as if I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. In addition, they kill many of the moments of fear even before they even hint that they are going to happen. On top of that, it takes a few hits on JAWS. It's like "hey look, we're being real and we can find BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking." <br /> <br /> Yes, you are, ignoring your extravagant errors in logic, of course. . But JAWS had one thing that your movie does not have. It's scary Yes, it is implausible. Yes, it is something outrageous. But frankly, in fact or not, a killer shark is not close to being as terrifying as a Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing simply hurts more. Even JAWS the Revenge is more scary than this.
