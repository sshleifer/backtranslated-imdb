WARNING: THE REVIEW CONTAINS LIGHT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe where Gone In 60 Seconds is an independent, dark, controversial and independent film. Unfortunately, in this dimension it has gone ... it is a striking, vacuous, crazy test, starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not worth getting into, he and his large number of friends have four days to steal Fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This team is formed by the type of ears in a funny way that is rumored to be the new Superman; a guy who was driving electricity in The X-Files; a former professional footballer and two symbolic black men. <br /> <br /> His enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Cracker's Bilborough, his Manchester accent appropriately flattened and expanded to the American public who is now accustomed to that kind of thing since Daphne in Frasier. There's also Angelina Jolie, who has no character; Except to be a receptacle to the sexual desires of men. She and Cage are supposed to be old flames, which is strange, since they never have anything that comes close to a normal conversation on all the long 135m length of the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so bad that whenever anyone has a "moment" he plays a violin in the background to accentuate the "emotion". It is not easy to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous "hand-ball" maneuver by Paul Gasgoine and is quite threatening when he is silent) only gets a line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent summary of the dubious morality of the film after appearing mute throughout the process is fun. Allegedly. After he struggles through that in his "not-acting-but-I-will-do" London accent, Cage jokes "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you can imagine, were fine and really ticklish. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the most underdeveloped aspect, from comedy without comedies to the two token black characters. This sees how the biggest aspect of Hollywood takes hold; Why is it that a black man can not appear in a great movie without being constantly aware of his skin tone and referring to it incessantly? The youngest man, who, like the old man, jive-speaks throughout the duration, proclaims: "we blacks do not like the cold ... we are tropical people". Then he continues to express the need to smoke a joint and observe Roots. He is, of course, parodying the image of blacks, but how funny is that? His older counterpart can not speak without referring to himself, and therefore to his color, in the third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know of black people who really talk like that? He thought not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is played almost non-stop and, as the volume increases, some of the tracks, especially "Do not Stop The Rock" by Apollo 440, are so strong that they are actually more audible than sound effects and dialogue. The surround sound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different movies running together. Here there is no concept of background music, it is the auditory equivalent of trying to watch a movie, while someone in the back of the cinema has its stereo at full volume. "Put down that music, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and I enjoyed it in many ways. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and witty, with minimal effort in its construction. Apparently, box office expectations are considerably low for this movie. After being force-fed for several years, it seems that the general public is beginning to realize.
