I saw this movie as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and I was horrified by the child, sado-masochistic and graphic pornography I witnessed. The story line is hidden beneath too many graphic sex scenes, and none of them is, in the least, erotic; Sick is more the sensation. The director seemed to be looking for a shock value instead of exploring the different levels of why these characters are like that. See if you can handle it, I still have flashbacks.
