The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle a large amount of material (including opening credits and final title) of Criminally Insane. The new recording, filmed on video, really stands out as poorly made. The scenes lack adequate lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even faults in the video like the moving image and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all the bad sequels, basically just repeat the story of the first. Ethel kills everyone who shares her living space, often for reasons that have to do with the fact that they are in the way of the food they want. <br /> <br /> At least it's just an extra on the DVD for the first, which also includes the same film by director Satan Black Wedding. Too bad it does not include Death Nurse movies.
