If you are going to try to create tension in a movie, it is always a good idea not to build it beyond total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers have not yet understood it. <Br /> <br /> This movie sucks, unlike most of its characters that (if you did not work are vampires in the first few minutes and then you're embarrassed) preferring the plentiful supply of "no one knows where I am". I'm gay cheerleaders and vagabonds who flow conveniently and with an arrogance of fast food, passing through their isolated door. <br /> <br /> The only thing of originality in the plot is how these vampires become vampires in the first place, but the rest is ridiculous and careless. <br /> <br /> Forced to pick up sticks (like opposing stakes) on a regular basis because of their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are not too bright. . If they fed their victims, they could manage their own small blood farm and reduce the death rate, which would allow them to settle and ram themselves. <br /> <br /> Why the producers considered it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and homosexual homosexual brother is not sure. He added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate since there was not a big plot to start and he had no shock value. <br /> <br /> It was never said why parents died, unless, of course, that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Clearly, the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or another, but again, it was for the viewer to write his own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was the younger brother who emerges looking like Pugsley from the Adams family. In fact, it was too rounded, with the appearance of a child who, without realizing it, wandered from a class of weight watchers to a very bad horror movie. Oh dear, he had. It does not matter, my dear, have another donut with a delicious blood center.
