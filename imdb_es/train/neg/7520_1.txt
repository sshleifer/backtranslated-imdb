This movie shows that you can not judge a movie by the impressive illustration on the cover of the DVD. It also shows that you should learn more about a movie before buying it (or buying it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old man from the street) brings to the classmates of the university a book full of witch spells that he leaves in his annual haunted house (where the film takes place). After that there is some alcohol, fights and soft pornography. Then, the action of the film finally takes place after more than an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, the end of Hallow was predictable, with no resources and reminded of a soft-core pornography. This movie probably looks better with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. And for those who see it for the first time, it is really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
