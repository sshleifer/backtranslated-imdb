ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not the best time of Richard Harris either. Like a demented fisherman, like Ahab, Harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the "wife" of the whale and the unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. She shouts a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and somehow ends up in the arctic fighting against the crazed whale revenge. There are no special effects to talk about, except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale's eye. There are endless images of Harris reflected in the eye so that the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as a member of the Harris team, has a particularly nasty career with the Orca and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn are not doing very well either.
