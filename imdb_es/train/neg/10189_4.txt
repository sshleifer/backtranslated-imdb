I saw this movie years ago, and it impressed me ... but again I was only 12 years old. I recently saw him again and I want to go back that time. This movie is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (look at My Bodyguard (1980) if you would like to see a GOOD movie I was in ... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this paper <br /> <br /> Anyway, the character of Lee Majors, Franklyn Hart, is a former racing driver who plans to drive his racing car (which he had stored) across the country to California. One problem: the government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was fine (not the worst I've heard), but the execution failed horribly.
