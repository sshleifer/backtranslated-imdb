I rented this movie just for the fact that the cover appealed to me. However as soon as the movie started I regretted it. It seems that they used a video camera to film this movie and let a young child do it. They also used inappropriate shapes and ghostly faces to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have done it myself and done it better. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that I had some really good ideas, but due to unreliable lines and, in some cases, acting, they were eclipsed. I had no address. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit through all this because it caused me physical pain to see it, but I always finish what I started, so I took a deep breath and let it continue. . I definitely wasted 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> It would save me the embarrassment of knowing you've seen 'Haunted Boat' and would find something more entertaining. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but it was a big disappointment. I thought nothing could get worse after 'Terror Toons', but this made me reconsider. A disappointment to his gender. <br /> <br /> * of ***** (The star is for the ideas of having your worst fears).
