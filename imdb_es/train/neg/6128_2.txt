This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not base a full movie on that! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story, but short episodes with strange secondary characters, who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine. <br /> <br /> Shame, Because most of the actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for the Hungarian movie. It was boring, although it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more than this ... 2 of 10
