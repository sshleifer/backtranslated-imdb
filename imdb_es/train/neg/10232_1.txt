It's one of those dramas that is so bad that it almost reaches the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely terrible, the direction is horrible, the lighting is pure armor, the only thing that disappoints a truth so bad that it feels good is that the sound The design is just bad enough; it does not add suspense to history although it tries hard, but at least it does not destroy any discourse. There are problems of continuity of seasons of door shots in everything. And finally, last but not least, the acting is frightening. For a professional production, it has the feeling of being a university media project that you have to feel for the forgiveness of anyone who had to put their names on this.
