This movie is a disaster. I'm surprised that he even has a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams I would have gone directly to the video. It is poorly written It is misdirected. The worst of the offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no emotions or suspense or internal or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film fits into a series of ridiculous scenes. that are so exaggerated that the audience with whom I saw laughed at it. Save your money The trailer is totally deceptive, has no suspense or emotion, in fact, the worst offensive of the film is that it is simply boring.
