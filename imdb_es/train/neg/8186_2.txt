Did someone read the script? This has to be one of the worst writings and addresses of the entire year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not get this one out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti's eyes were saying, I can not believe he signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's on the list of really bad Christmas movies. There are not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie just does not move with Vaughn's swindler dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy you can not get past. It was just a step without brightness, that nobody seemed to be able to enter.
