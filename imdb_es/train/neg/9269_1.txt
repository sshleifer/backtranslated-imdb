Well, since I see part 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should NEVER have done part 4. All that is grumpy, and what I do want to say is that the score is bad and the performance really bad, I I dare someone to see this and not get bored. minds <br /> <br /> I mean that parts 1 to 3 kept the atmosphere strong in the Damion plot, but without it in this it is not the same. Surely at the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continuous story, but it was a good closing at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there were, they could have done a job MUCH better than this sh * t that I had to sit on, hahaha. There goes an hour and a half of my life that I will never see again.
