Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many disappeared characters, without romantic scenes, changes in the story line, too short, appeared low budget. Difficult dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it seems that Lorna has a cold pain in her upper lip. I'm sure that makeup is better to hide it. I guess they did not want to stop filming until it healed, too bad. Most likely, this movie lacks kissing scenes. Only a disappointing scene of kisses at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and the truth must be told. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more fun and more faithful to the book.
