While it is early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought that it also had potential, but I was deeply disappointed. My instinct tells me that the Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager, however. <br /> <br /> As for the impressions of the pilot ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good topics I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the program were interesting, with the progress of the exploration and an appropriate theme. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the story lacked the "feeling" of starting a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more of a "generic" Trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step into space", simply sub-plot and subtext. If the references to this first mission of the deep space were eliminated, the plot would be difficult to differentiate between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot did not reflect or do justice to the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot of the launch of the first mission would have been large enough without the "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploration, they could have been history. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that would once again make us THINK). Make us feel the emotion of "the wind" and be in "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a lot of shooting. There was too much weaponry. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling that humans were "freshmen" at an established school. New children on the block, instead of venturing into a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed at our door instead of us finding them. That meeting could have been much more historical and much more sociological. How do two different societies interact? Do not just insinuate it, SHOW IT! <br /> <br /> I had to think of it more as "Trek with an uncomfortable team and limited technology" instead of "the first courageous steps into the unknown". I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude by reiterating the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The general theme is the most interesting, as we saw Kirk for the first time in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck, Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> To producers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK *! :-)
