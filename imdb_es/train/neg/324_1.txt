The worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I picked up this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler, I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. Halfway through the movie, my three friends were asleep and I was still suffering. The worst plot, the worst script, the worst movie I've seen in my life. I wanted to bang my head against a wall for an hour, then I would stop, and you know why? Because it felt very good. When I hit my head, I put that damn movie in the microwave and I saw it burn ... and I felt better than anything else I did. He took American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to get over that shit. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡NO GOING!
