Another movie of "son that will not grow", and only the other similar recent entries. Heder in another bad wig, channeling Napoleon to, what, the third time? Anna Faris is forgettable, as always; Jeff Daniels called this from another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how does one become a box so late in the race? Do not bother. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times. I will say this; It's a hundred times better than "Launch failure". There are very few funny snippets in the movie, unless you think Eli Wallach's curse is funny. LOL! He's old and he dropped the bomb! Tee, hee, hee. Regrettable!
