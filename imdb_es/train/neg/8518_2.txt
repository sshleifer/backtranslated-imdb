I am surprised by the amount of comments in this program about how "real" it is. Maybe it's not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is something, it's too big. <br /> <br /> The action is to chew the landscape with enthusiasm and the plots have holes that you could drive. a truck through. That is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> He is so fervent in his desire to be "relevant" that he only shows how isolated Rob Thomas and his staff are from reality. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that at best it was a dream party and, at worst, more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell seems like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the exaggerated style of the whole show.
