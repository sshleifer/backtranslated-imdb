'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, who are struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the performance is deficient and the links between the past misfortunes of the characters and the current mentality are represented in an awkward and schematic way. What disappoints most of all, however, is that the representation is life in the office of the title of the film: there is no mechanization, and it is impossible to determine what the staff really does to make a living. Of course, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office will surely close in the 1930s, if it ever existed. It's a shame, since the overall tone of the film is poignant and ironic, and there's something promising on the stage: but some of the details convince. In general, you feel the work of someone who has not experienced much of real life; A film of students, with a concept and a scheme, but unfortunately little else.
