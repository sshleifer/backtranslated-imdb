Oh, I think this may be the simplest movie I've ever seen. Seriously, this is one of the best series movies. The first test is that it is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's too common for this. I got it on VHS, from a container full of rental videos in my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I can cite the ad: "In the 17th century in Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for all ages, his name was Mayeda, he is sent on an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 flies from the King of Spain, while at sea, a violent storm swallows its precious gold destined to buy weapons and almost takes life ... Mayeda must fight all odds to survive and secure the fate of her loved Japan ". Then he continues saying: "A multimillion-dollar epic adventure on three continents." <br /> <br /> I must have seen a different movie. This was not an epic, and it certainly was not a multi-millionaire. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really one of the crazy adventures of Mayeda (Sho Kosugi) who speaks Engrish. He is not even a Shogun, but that is not important. What is important is that he makes a good impression of John Cleese's repeated charge of the castle in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', and his ability to move from serious scenes to display his samurai mental powers. Awesome. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the Engrish accent of Sho Kosugi. The film may lack almost everything that makes it a good movie, but it makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines of all time, provided by the coolest Engrish accent of all time. And honestly, do you really want something more? You could overtake 'Shogun Mayeda' until the end, and repeat Kosugi's final line again and again. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Very, very cheesy.
