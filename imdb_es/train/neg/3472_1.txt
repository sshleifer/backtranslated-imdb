James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what was it that took a role in this garbage without grace? Affleck is just a lightweight who simply can not cut it, the rest of the cast is truly unforgettable. I saw this in the USA UU In an empty theater, I soon learned why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I left before the end was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I returned to England and saw that the film had a brilliant report of that yoyo "Paul Ross" on one of the Sundays of the market. I always trust that Ross will save me money on movie tickets, if he says that the movie is good, I go directly to this website to see it. This movie should have gone directly to the DVD of Â£ 1.99 at a supermarket near you.
