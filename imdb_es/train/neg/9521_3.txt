This movie has been getting a lot of play lately during the day on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they are assuming that people would be interested in comparing it with the Leonardo DiCaprio caper / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see it is because of the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum Although I must say that Matt was more than a little long on the tooth to be a high school student. If he were a woman, they would have made him play the MOTHER of a high school student! (Is it just me, or is your daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh, yes, the plot, who cares? Typical teenage highjinx played by adults.
