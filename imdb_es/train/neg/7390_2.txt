['How do you spell the fat washed Italian who can barely achieve a martial arts movement without the need of a heart medication? In this film, we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement; since he started his career, it has been a constant decline of pathetic for indulgent behavior that has affected his career. In this film, it seems that most of his training consisted of ordering fettuccine alfredo in his restaurant every day. <br /><br /> He is fat, slow and very old in this movie, just a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing clown. <br /><br /> It&#39;s time for Steven Seagal to retire, this movie has approximately 2 hours of reasons. <br /><br /> Synopsis: a fat Italian man with a great reputation in the force realizes that a criminal group may be playing with a drug designed by the military to create the best war response. This pretension, although pathetic and ridiculous, offers the opportunity to some of the most important fight scenes that include flying through the walls like a comic. <br /><br /> Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yes. I do.']
