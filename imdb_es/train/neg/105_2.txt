There are tons of beautiful women in this movie. But, unfortunately, this movie is nude-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this film takes place in 1971. So, why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most horrible effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure that someone has failed work on this, but there was no 3D, only blurry images. I did not have the same problem with other 3D movies of this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those sucked also, but with them I could see a 3D effect appearance. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And whoever it is The women were the ones who played the daughter of the lady who eats ears, yum! I would like to see more of her. In the movies, too. It seems that Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
