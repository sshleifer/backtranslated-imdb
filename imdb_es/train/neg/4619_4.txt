Let me say first that I love the stories of Westerns and the Civil War. I also consider John Ford an excellent director. I also have the same feelings for the acting ability of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I do not remember if I saw this movie when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it, of course. <br /> <br /> According to my rating of 4, it can be said that I did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will try to explain some of your deficiencies. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote the screenplay for Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many excellent scripts. This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the terrible conditions of the Andersonville prison. At the time of the movie, Andersonville was not operational. They also use rifles that were not used at that time. <br /> <br /> John Ford directed films for more than 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He must have been sick during the realization of this. His usual style was missing. It could be that this was a movie in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> Normally he had a player stock company that he used in almost all his film, this time MOST was missing. This time, only the junior cowboy stars Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss have roles and, of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords' stock company made the majority of his films the classics they were; Unfortunately, it was lost here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The duke must also have been sick, seemed out of place here. This type of role usually fits perfectly with your style, it was only suitable here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here, in her first main role (second film), is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but in reality she is not an actress. He still has papers on television. Let me be kind and say that you have had a long career, more based on your appearance than on your acting talent. Also in caas since Miss Towers' maid is tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad you've been attached to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the high standard of other John Ford films. a few songs of military type, supposedly made by the cavalry in march, nothing good. The action scenes were good, but they reach the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Qualifications * 1/2 * (of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
