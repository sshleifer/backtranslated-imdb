Well, to begin with? This is, by far, one of the worst movies I've paid to see. I'm not going to comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. For starters, the performance, with the exception of Eric Bana, is a telenovela quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here all the actors in The Bold and the Beautiful embarrass him. The action of the camera does not help either. How he stays in it when he's thinking, he just takes me back to the lab days of Brooke Forrester! Peter O'Toole has had very bad plastic surgery or desperately needs one. Either way, she looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish my comments, Diane Kruger is a pretty girl, but she is not Helen of Troy. Peterson should have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor would be a little miserable by now.
