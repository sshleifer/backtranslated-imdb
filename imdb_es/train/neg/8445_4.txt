For me, each work of art must be judged by these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to the forms: beautiful shots and, sometimes, interesting performances. Long close-ups suggest a function that the viewer can complete on his or her own. Due to the lack of texts, the story becomes a questionnaire. An introverted person suggests having depth, but sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say. This movie acts like an introverted person. If you have not read the synopsis, you can not see what the suicide was (and the unanswered question Why?) Which changes Anna's vision about life and makes her suspicious. 'Why you do not talk to me?' Sebastiaan asks. Anna does not answer, she just starts looking at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does that mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What does this movie have to say? What does this movie mean? The answer for me: it shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The reasons behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Pleasant and artistic fact, but meaningless without having to discard the 'instructions for use'. In my opinion, this film is made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.
