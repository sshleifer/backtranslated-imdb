Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Actually, few movies are "so bad that they're good", and Zombie 3 is not only bad, it's unfortunately, unforgivably bad in so many ways that a completely new language may be needed just to describe them all <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherence, sense or reason However, we can not blame Fulci since it was not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have the sense of Fulci's style to help lead the film. Mattei seems to have contributed little to the film, but an amazing ineptitude. <br /> <br /> Then, I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombie 3. It has no redeeming characteristics, in a known genre For thin characters, weak story and lack of ability to make movies , Zombie 3 pushes the boat, but doing so is even more fun than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The "action" starts when "Death 1" Gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it and why did the US military think that creating cannibal legions of the undead would be a good idea? All these questions and more will not be answered in Zombie 3 ... <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief goes crazy for all the green plastin that grows on his face before being tracked by the army that, in a somewhat silly way, decides that the best way to get rid of its corpse is to burn it, sending "Death 1" to the atmosphere, resulting in ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombies !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why do not zombie birds attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we find our "heroes", a trio of hot GIs and a girls' carriage. There are also a couple of other types with them, but they are not important, NO ONE is important here. It will be hard for you to remember someone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to worry about them. They end up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago, this place was full of life, now it is full of flies!") But there is no escape from the living dead. <br /> <br /> By this it indicates that you will be completely absorbed or you will have extinguished the damn thing. The script is so scary that even the best performance in the world could not save it, so it's better that they have some of the worst, and not just the human characters, the zombie acting here is a low moment. There is no coherence in the way zombies behave, some get confused in time-honored style, others engage in fistfights or carry machetes, not to mention zombies that can still talk (a trick that gives to the movie that is HORRIFICATION OF THE END OF TWIST). They die by shooting in the chest (instead of the head) and they are even hit by a good left hook. How can you hit a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on the action of the 80 badly made often makes it look like an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> The zombies also spend a lot of time hidden, apparently waiting for hours in ridiculous places in the possibility that some poor The sap will pass and you will receive the fright of your life. They hide in the bushes, in the garages, in the huts, on the roofs, in the water, and even under the pregnant women. At one point, a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. Kill her and eat her? Do not! To push her into the water, those zombies and her strange sense of humor! <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of blood. The extremities are cut, the wounds are overflowing with green pus, and there is much in the way of eating meat and making people grimace. There is nothing that matches the original piercing of the eyeball, but if the makeup effects are your suitcase, they will not let you down. <br /> <br /> All this, and I have not even mentioned the horrible music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose performance really stands out as REALLY bad, or the chilling last sentence ... In a witty Twist on the original radio station invaded by zombies, Zombie 3 gives us a real zombie DJ! "He has gone to his side!" the cry of our hero who escapes, before swearing to continue fighting against the living dead in a sequel that unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is a garbage: it would not be a loss to the world if each and every impression were destroyed. the records of its existence were erased, but somehow I feel that my life is richer for having seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I wanted to say 88 minutes shorter ...
