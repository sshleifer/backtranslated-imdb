It was a painful experience, the whole story is really there, so I'm not going to go into that, but the acting was horrible. There is a part in the beginning when the scientific brother goes to work. Actually, wear a white coat at home before leaving. To work, I thought that working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterile clothes in a controlled environment and the lab looks like a school lab. This monitor has a filing cabinet on it that has nothing to do with the whole scene. to make the place seem technical and a scientist is having breakfast in the laboratory and next to him there is a bottle labeled with biological risk and his boss approaches it and does not even say anything about it ... not to mention the bad performance. very bad I can not be worse than my advice, do not see it and I thought that nothing could be worse than the house of the dead, apparently Uwi Boll's films look like those of classic Shakespeare compared to this!
