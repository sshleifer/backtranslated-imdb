This is the kind of movie that leaves you with an impression. The writing of a story IS what the film is about. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects .. Very good performance, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect ... Except ... History is poor and, therefore, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you had the power to be invisible ... What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could not think of anything else to do but to caress and rape women. This is all that supposedly your "genius" mind could think of. Are you trying to gain extra power? No. He does not even bother looking for a way to be visible again. The guy is basically a maniac crazed by sex. <br /> <br /> Add to that, the lab environment, you have all these young people ... Making jokes as if they were in a bar ... If it were not for all the white coats and equipment, you would think that This is a bad imitation of "Cheers". Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care in making you think that these guys are nothing more than lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the film falls short because most of the "" exciting scenes are written so poorly and are full of illogical behavior on the part of the actors who are just screaming "this is just a stupid thing that I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me. " <br /> <br /> If you read the real book, while the Scientist (Cane) persecutes women, there is a great deal of mental manipulation and disturbing thoughts that go into his character. In the movie, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a market full of people to rub his body against women and get off. How sad.
