This is in fact a divine adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble the book as much as possible. But the performance was horrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I think was a true image of Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feeling, and throughout the film he could not see his love "growing" by Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "re-record" her main role, as well as that of her partner. Also, there was no chemistry among the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, did not seem to have any real ties to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem as disconsolate as they portrayed her in the book. The movie settings are also too poor. The costumes are even more. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse dressing in a more elegant and elegant way than here. The end is also too long. It's good to look like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending to a movie. And again, I can not see any feeling of happiness in Mr.Knightley's face. To conclude, he believed that this adaptation was loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed as if the movie had been made without any budget. I'd rather see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it's clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster", that to see these actors (except the good Olivia Williams and the best Kate Beckinsale) ruin the Script full.
