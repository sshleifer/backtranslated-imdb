Honestly, this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I've seen. In part, because he takes himself so seriously, unlike the usual trash, these films want you to get emotionally involved, to feel the characters and to worry about the supposed conspiracy. None of this is not even close to happening. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent plot and totally not sensible . 2.) The annoying style on the substance "MTV" camera work. 3.) Moronic characters and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when these films were made, they could not decide whether to make the movies. a film about church conspiracies, stigmas or possession. Guess what? They combined them! An aetheist is possessed by a dead person, who then causes him to display the stigmata to expose a church conspiracy. How a normal person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained, not even spoken of. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives him the stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, they invite us to scenes of screaming out loud, recording cryptic messages in cars and writing messages on the walls. Apparently, this priest was also a violent guy, because the young woman possessed also fights in one of the characters, while speaking with that clich√©, harsh and "possessed" voice that we have all heard countless times. This also begins to be linked to my second complaint, because each time the young woman receives the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity floating in the air and throwing everything and everyone around her as if they were in an earthquake. Why did this happened? Who knows!?! I guess the director thought he looked "great". <br /> <br /> 2.) These films contain dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds that appear out of nowhere and fly, and the most annoying, of the water that drips. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably collapse with so many holes. To summarize this complaint, towards the end, and without any reason, the camera cuts the jets of water that drip, in slow motion, in reverse. WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance at all, and once again, I bet the director thought he looked "great". <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says that he became a priest to explain. holes in science This does not make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through all the rigamarole to become a priest. I just do not buy it. Second, there are many holes in the plot, some of which I will explain below. To begin with, the first time you get the stigmata, the scene ends with your unconscious, bleeding. Next, she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is towards the end, when the character of the "scientific priest" mentioned above speaks with the spirit that possesses the girl. He says: "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word for word, but you understand the idea. Your answer? "You have no faith, just doubt!" So, for this, he owns an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, much less any scientific priest! And then, there's the fact that the object of the conspiracy of this movie, this lost Gospel (from St. Thomas, I think) is available in local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you can walk to a bookstore and buy it. Perhaps this is supposed to happen in an alternative story, where it is not well known, but the film never tries to tell us this, or even hint that this is an alternative event of the revelation of that document. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. He is my archenemy, who feels the need to insult every opportunity I have. I detest it Final Rating: F
