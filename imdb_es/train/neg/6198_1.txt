To begin with, this cowardly and offensive film intrigued me. The characters are the dispossessed young male relatives who are often bored in a coastal city. Robert is a stranger, but he has his music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay turns Robert into a monster who embarks on a journey to cannabis and ecstasy and messes with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "refrigerated craziness" and Robert ends the movie as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much real-life experience this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British people are out of control. A very subtle link is established with the Iraqi insurgents; During the unnecessarily graphic violation, we are subject to explosions and images of war. The film shows the male extremism of the peer group pushed to its limits. The young bombers of London drew a parallel with Clay's odious representation of modern man. Clay implies that men simply can not avoid inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that advocate such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still recovering from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first movie, I'd love it to be the last one.
