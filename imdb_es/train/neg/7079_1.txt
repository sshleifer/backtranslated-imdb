There is no reason to bother to rent this movie. From the initial credits, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but really there is nothing erotic about it. The look at the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only up to a point. <br /> <br /> The boring sex scenes, the bad plot and the cameos of Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
