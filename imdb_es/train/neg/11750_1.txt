The guy who wrote, directed and observed this shocking piece of garbage really should consider a caregiver change. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this shit? There are so many talented writers out there where you could spend the best money. I think the idea is great, but the acting, the script and the direction are just horrible. The jokes are not so funny, I understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey. BUT do it with style, this movie is screaming live parodies of the Saturday night of 1995. Why? I say again, why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk? NEVER OFFERS A COMEDIAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECTLY IN STAR ON HIS OWN MOVIE. DUH!
