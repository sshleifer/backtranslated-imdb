I captured this at IFC yesterday, and I can not believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought that these "ladies" were nothing? Kate tells Jed that she could be fired because she is supposed to be a pillar of the community, but she gets him out! So suddenly they decide they're in love? And she is so devastated by his death, she does not go to her funeral, much less, she tells her family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American come to be the director of a very appropriate British school? Janine should have been expelled from force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up fighting with a scam that she brought for questioning! And the less you say about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for the guilt that Janine and Molly feel for Jed, please! It's the damn guilt of punk that became roadkill! Where is the guilt about poor Gerald, who is vomited? I wish I could do the same with the bozos behind this "movie"!
