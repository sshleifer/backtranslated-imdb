This film was slow but tedious and the acting often derived in the land of the ham. The character of Redgrave was not as attractive as the woman in something who tried to compete with something 20 of Thurman for the love of the character of Fox (why he is beyond me). The title of the film should have been "Shallow people in the lake". The actors played as if they were in a rehearsal. A terribly predictable ending to boot. I can not believe that this is on this website as a comedy!
