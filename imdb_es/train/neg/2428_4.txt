What spectators will remember most is the bad headache that the film has given them due to the excessively striking, unstable, the camera work and the fast and confusing cut. I am not against such stylistic devices if they are well done as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh test with most of their films, but in this case there was too much. It seems that the power cuts and the flashes of light that accompanied each flight over Mexico City and each important scene were there to distract him from realizing that the story is quite thin and everything was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily discover how this will end. For a film that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that its story has been told so many times and with much more depth and development of the character. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to see a higher action movie, I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the wave of murders of Denzel Washington's character and failed to offer credible performances. The first half hour or so nothing happens, except that archetypes and clich√©s are portrayed and when the action machine begins to roll, it cuts so quickly that you do not know what really happens. So the film does not work either at the level of a credible drama / thriller, or as a pure action movie. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the most messy blockbusters of recent years, but I can not understand why so many people say that this movie is something new and so cool. For a video clip it is too long and for a movie it has very little substance.
