Very re-edited and, often, confusing, the original version of the Man On Fire screen was at least ten years outdated when it was made and the past years have not improved it. This is the kind of film that producers with too much money and little experience do to get attention and everyone else does it just to pay their exceptional alimony or their drug dealer, with the bodyguard of Scott Glenn on a limb to rescue their followers One-year charge, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - have done better, the action is slow and scattered and only the exceptionally fine score of John Scott (part of which appeared in the last Die Hard roll) makes a positive impression A case in which the remake (made by Tony Scott, the director's original choice for this version) is an improvement.
