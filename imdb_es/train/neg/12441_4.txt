Some things need to be clarified. The image of Mark Ferris is not Mark Mark Ferris who starred in this film. I know because he was my father. Please, delete that image. In addition, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I've been trying to find a copy or a way to watch this movie again. Years have passed and if someone can tell me how to get a copy, it would be great. The movie was not that bad, and trying to compare it with the current world of Star Wars and other science fiction technologies is useless. If you see it, simply enjoy it because of the rediction and the humor it has. Choose to be movie snobs and enjoy less creative and innovative films.
