I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had a Commodore 64 and I loved playing Rambo on it. Therefore, I was very excited when I bought this really cheap movie. I put it on my VCR and I started: this movie is very bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the whole movie (except for that horrible sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face at all times. And that stupid love thing in the middle, it's so incredibly predictable. I just resent everything quickly and went to change the movie for something else.
