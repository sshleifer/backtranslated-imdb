I was incredibly excited to see this movie after reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was waiting for him too. I rented it and snuggled up to enjoy a classic holiday story that came to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film deviated from the book more times than it is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this, he seemed to be completely in character only 20% of the time. The rest of the time was pretty flat. <br /> <br /> I realize that this was done in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it seemed to be a quality B film, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of The Christmas Gift takes Scrooge around the world, observing people in the darkest circumstances that still have the light and love of Christmas. <br /> <br /> I admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "Reformed" scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing performance. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit had been described as a little more irregular and trite. And Tiny Tim ... oh, I do not even mean bad child actors ...
