To a large extent, Bollywood fans hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard, but I think it's very overrated. Manmohan Desai collaborated before in movies like Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I've seen them all I liked, so I had high expectations before seeing Mard and I was disappointed bitterly. My main complaint about Mard is that it seems that Amar Akbar Anthony part 2, maybe Mr. Desai ran out of ideas, after all, he had been using that formula for years and years. 1. First, some members of the cast are repeated in AAA, for example, the police inspector who mentions Amar, the Muslim who has Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few others raised. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses her sight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) and in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Having seen AAA for more than 1000 times, I noticed that immediately. <br /> <br /> My other complaints are that some of the situations seem ridiculous, the real Manmohan Desai made you leave your brain at the door as in the movies, but with Mard I thought I was going too far. My last complaint is that, compared to the songs of Manmohan Desai's previous films, I found the songs quite disappointing. I know he has many fans who swear, but I did not like it a bit. It really hurts me to write this review because I'm a big fan and I loved his films since I was a kid.
