This movie raises a series of urgent questions in my mind. In the first place, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to maintain a career as a film actress during all these years based on that shrill and ridiculous voice and on the very limited range of facial expressions of hammy that she uses? Secondly ... what the hell were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive movie think? And thirdly ... since there were people perverted enough to decide to get drunk like this, there should not be anyone in the system, the studio, the distributors or somewhere, healthy enough to prevent it from being completed and published. . . I really would have to look for a very, very long way to convert another film as deeply unpleasant as this ... and it is not even considered a horror movie, which, insofar as it can be considered as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The film is stirred from beginning to end in the most sickly type of madness, violence and abuse, and essentially has no characteristics of redemption. Actually I'm not advocating censorship (which I do not believe in) ... but I really can not see how anyone could get something positive out of watching a movie like this.
