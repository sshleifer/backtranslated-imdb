The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's twin experiments, consisting mainly of her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the experiments of twins. The movie obviously had excellent reviews. It is one of those topics on which nobody dares to express an opposite opinion. <br /> <br /> I also, for much of the movie, absorbed the emotion that the filmmaker obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously has nothing critical to say on the subject in a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, while a group of Jews argue with Kor in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgive "is even debated, but the Kor isolated and outnumbered is his" But for these dates , the content of the film in my latent emotional repertoire had been released enough that I could see clearly once more. After Eva Kor, "strong-willed" forgives her "Nazi captors," the film begins to delve into what it means to forgive, at least from Kor's point of view. The film tries to follow it, passing its public declaration forgiving the Nazis and entering a new territory. For me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by the inedible fat of his "act of forgiveness". Obviously, it was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test his theory of forgiveness, to heal the wounds of the past, he goes to the "promised land" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the problems they face and to see if the dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and are interspersed to a large extent in discussions and discussions with Jews in the United States about their act of forgiving the Nazis, including one in a Jew. center in chicago From that moment, anyone who does not have watery eyes and can not see the screen will have difficulty overlooking the obvious contradiction in their statements. <br /> <br /> First of all, he immediately realizes his body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. His comments about how he feared they could kidnap her show how much waste of time, effort and money the whole act was. A Dr. Sami Advan (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem), quite annoyed, understands it very well when she tells Kor to make a statement about how she would prefer to be asleep in her apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, Debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where he "criticizes" the meaning of forgiveness and his right to do so, following those who continue to suffer the trauma of acts. <br /> <br /> I Will cut to the chase. At the end of the movie, I hoped I had not chosen to watch the movie. The film was badly made, not going deep into anything about Auschwitz other than the purely trivial, just enough to make sure that the holocaust was refreshed in the memory of the spectator and incite a flood of tears. He showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary could not participate in a fair discussion. Their discussion skills were limited to rethinking their position on forgiveness (in the best case) to a complete lack of willingness to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, are everyone so behind today that they can not tell the difference between making peace and forgiving? In citing another IMDb user, "I do not see that her forgiveness is weak, on the contrary, she just wanted to alleviate her domination of her soul, she wanted the suffering to end, so she let it go". That would be the perfect definition of DOING PEACE for a layman. <br /> <br /> I suppose that, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no space to question those who "have gone through more than the human". the mind can understand. "<br /> <br /> PS The dictionary should include all the lists of books to buy that everyone keeps doing.
