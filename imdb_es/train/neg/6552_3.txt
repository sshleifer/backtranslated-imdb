Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) has wandered into a post apocalypse desert (after her protector died of old age, she said that the protector was played by Elias Koteas, a really decent actor) and now she finds that people Divaga Debris in search of cyborgs for scrap trade and cash. She leads a group of burned cyborgs (which includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it's still a pretty boring feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used well, action sequences are routine and the name of the cast as McDowell, Katt and Galligan have little to do. Haje is in fact a plaintive heroine and Lynch is too exaggerated (as always) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as funny as her hilarious ancestor. (Van Damme's, the second is simply boring). Also disappointing is the angle of science fiction that resists almost aggressively any good idea you have. As an action movie, this is a routine and by the B-movie numbers and it's done competently, that's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (Poor)
