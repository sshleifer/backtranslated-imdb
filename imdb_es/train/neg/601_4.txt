!!!!! Of course there are spoilers! I'm sure this project started as a screen writing workshop to avoid clichés in horror films: female protagonist - verify that bad things happen to drug addicts - Heorine controls the villain - checks that heroin is not given account that the villain is recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence, so we see the villain recovered crawling behind the heroin - Verification Unfortunately, it seems that someone has sent this list of clichés to a movie studio instead of using it to class. Dear, oh, if the transport from London was as regular as the clichés that appear here. In fact, there are so many clichés and I have seen it all before the moments that nobody really thought about going into details about what eponymous deception is or how long it has been killing people in hiding. They lead me to believe that it is the result of a human experiment and maybe it is not until that night that he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that it does not make sense. Not be totally negative. I doubt very much if the producers thought they would make a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there is always a market for horror films. Similarly, I doubt if it cost too much to produce and I had an eye on the DVD market instead of the film distribution and I'll say it's a little better than the 1972 DEATH LINE, which also featured a killer cannibal hiding in the London subway. It's just that when you think that all the clichés have been used in this movie, another cliché appears to raise its ugly head.
