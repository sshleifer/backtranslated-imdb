--- what happened to these unpleasant people. Alan Arkin, as usual, was not happy and just walked through the paper. Children are all a disaster. Mariesa Tomei would probably wish that this role had never come her way. And what do Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno do in this really bad movie? If you enjoy watching the losers wallow in their dysfunction, and do not try to do better, this is your movie. Everyone else, go for a walk, read a book or see something else. <br /> <br /> Jane
