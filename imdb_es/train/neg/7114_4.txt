As for cinematography, this movie was pretty good for the mid 50s. There were times when the lighting was too hot, but the shots were usually in the frame and kept focused. The performance was above average for a stinky low budget, but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were dragged too long in an attempt of suspense and the effects did not exist. The attack of the skull in the pond should have been completely eliminated from the final cut and every attempt to give life to the skull was obvious with punctures and cords. I also could not help thinking that the budget did not allow them to furnish the house, so they continued to make references to the moving agents and that all stored things should arrive soon. Honestly ... it would have been more entertaining if it had been a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good or bad" movie, but neither was it bad enough to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
