I rented this movie because I was looking in the horror movies section for those movies that nobody has ever heard of and it could be a possible jewel. I saw it and, since I am a fan of violence and blood, I understood it. He got the EM rating which means: extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally aimed at violence and everything else, I got it. The warning in the box read: Extreme violence, extreme language and nudity. "Extreme violence" hit my fantasy. The film ended up being a fairly docile slasher movie. I had one or two bloody scenes, but I've seen them worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of blood in a movie is not all that counts, right? You have plot too. Well, the plot was boring and there's nothing really special about it. Do not rent it. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine how anyone could really enjoy it to the point where they say, "I'm going to rent that again." He had moments when he kept you moving, but I will never see that movie again.
