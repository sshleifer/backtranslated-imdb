The first mistake you make when making a movie is to use "the living dead" without really having a budget for true FX zombies. Sure, this was a low budget zombie movie, very low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It really was not so bad considering the above, and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an "R" for violence, you can also give us some good pictures of the babies that are attacked. Women were used so little in this film that it could almost be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And, I'm running out of Oakland. There were many shots and there are no police officers in sight.
