This, the Tremors series direct video rattle, presents sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know when you see it) and more tedium and stuffing than you can shake a stick. The tremors 4 obviously skyrocketed with an overwhelming budget. That means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of the precious violence of worms in humans, at most. The lack of brightness, cast cast of clich√©s and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience is at least fifteen thousand years old. Only Tremors fans can sit down and let alone enjoy this movie. If you are not among them, do not bother.
