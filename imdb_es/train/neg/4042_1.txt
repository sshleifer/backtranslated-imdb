This movie is beautiful to look at, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if any) does not make any sense. But it is very "artistic". A lot of pictures of actors dressed half struggling and looking each other in the eye. Lots of artistic shots through the windows and with people outside the frame. Muttering and people wandering with nostalgia. Persistent close-ups of faces and bodies. When you get to the trio on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be about the relationship between father and son, but you'll only want the two of them to screw up and get away with it. If you've always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without money shots, your wish has been granted.
