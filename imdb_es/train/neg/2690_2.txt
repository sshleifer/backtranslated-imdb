Hey, if you have something more than an hour to kill and you think the painting is too exciting, I suggest it. If you like cheap movies like me, it's good for a giggle! Apart from that, I would not suggest renting it, I would wait until it comes out in the tube, for example, around 4 am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. By the way, the band that made this soundtrack was on the road two years after this movie, and none of them sounded so bad live according to the two reviews of small cities that I could find. So, once again, it's good if you think that the grass is becoming very funny but good to see if you like to see how NOT to shoot a low budget movie.
