I do not see this. This was one of the dumbest movies I've seen. It's hard to be Mormon at times when there are movies like this out there. What a sad vision of Mormon life. I can tell you if you saw this movie that is not like that at all in a singles room. If it were, I do not think I would have succeeded. It's a shame that most Mormon films are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. The acting was so bad that my wife and I barely made it. I guess you could say that I had all the signs of a B movie or are there movies in c? Anyway ... I just thought that this movie was bad and it was full of cheese. I want some Mormons to start making some quality films.
