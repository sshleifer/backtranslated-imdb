There was such exaggeration about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right after Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about in the New game program. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says stoically and nasally, "Wooww." <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually end. Spending a full hour was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals, only to discover that only a minute has passed (but it seemed like an eternity) since you last saw the clock. So, why did not I change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most other people did not ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner could be SO BAD. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought that this was the type of vehicle that would do it. Show the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was very dark. Seeing me left me depressed. You still wanted to find some excitement, but there was nothing you could have. There was not even enough light on the set to get a feeling of energy from the audience (who could not even be seen). <br /> <br /> Dear network: people do not see game shows to cure their insomnia. .. watch games programs to get excited and have a good time. Please, do us all a favor and lose this in the vault.
