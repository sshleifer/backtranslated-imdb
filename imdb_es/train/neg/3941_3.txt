This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store is running out of English titles. She is blessed with this work of what seems to be, yes, the Romanian cinema. However, I think it has true comic potential. <br /> <br /> The spoilers technically follow: <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it actually spoils the pleasure of seeing anyone ask why The movie set in a casino has a shooting scene with bow on the beach, even in flashback. That mystery, and many other enigmas, must still be exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are trapped in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> I also wonder out loud why such beautiful people allow themselves to abuse themselves in Film like this. It's sad.
