Actually, it was quite fun ... in a "god, how the hell this movie was made" in one way or another. If your life makes fun of movies ... what I do ... go and see ... but if you're really thinking "is this a good movie?" eff off. <br /> <br /> This movie was a suck from the start with the worst performance I've seen in any movie ... usually, give it five minutes before you realize that "this movie could be a shit ".. but no, you know from the beginning. this film talks about edgar allen poe ... I never tried to explain it to people who have not memorized the story of the life of poe ... so I do not know if something that was said is a fact. <br /> <This film is about a writer "ethan poe" who hooks up with his cousin "ann" .... both are descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they? Apparently, people give what their ancestors did. this ethan poe guy is actually ethan "ujier", who is supposed to be descended from the story "the usher's house" that was written by edgar allen poe. Ann's brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her ... Ann is also being harassed, at one point in the movie, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... it's as if they were behind her looking at her, and she does not even realize it). The characters that are being killed appear at the end to try to save the day ... but they can not. In the end, Ann shoots Ethan while he tries to kill his best friend. Of course, before she shoots him, she has to shout "Never again!" This movie should never be seen again!
