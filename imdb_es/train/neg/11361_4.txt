It's quite surreal what these flies can do ... hey, well ... this is a caricature, so anything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> At first I have to tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is just a list of faults: <br /> <br /> 1) I cited the line on the label. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special that I had never seen. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie do not look like real flies at all. At least they could have made them black. But the cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and thin torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year olds. I could say that in two sentences it is very simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American archives after all!" Oh! give me a break.
