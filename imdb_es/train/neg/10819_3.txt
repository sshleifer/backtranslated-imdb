I agree with one of the other commentary writers on the good story and the good actors, but they do not match, and I would also say that rushed. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as it was in school. But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when you see this story while the parts are left out and, therefore, does not make any sense. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester have barely spoken and, suddenly, he is proposing marriage !! The actors do not have time for the audience to know how their character feels about everything that happens in the story. The actors are good but they do not have enough time to do justice to this story. I'm sorry to say, but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my choice, BUT I should review the 1983 BBC series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles. I love it so much that I see it regularly. There is an abbreviated version that lasts 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
