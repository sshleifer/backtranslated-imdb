The film has a good start to portray an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very friendly secondary characters through the first half. But later, something happens and, suddenly, Shannon becomes this bad girl of second hand, serious face, and the film is lost in its own context. The second half lacks all kinds of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad acting, a horrible plot and even worse trick coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the gang of the Chechen mafia. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and clown, Bruce, but his daughter overcomes it, which makes it an even bigger shame than the double Bruce Lee played back then. I really believe that she can do much better than this and I hope she participates in a better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of the action and you do not care about the quality, go ahead and watch this movie Personally I looked forward to it, but I was terribly disappointed.
