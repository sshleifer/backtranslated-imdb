I went to see this with my wife and my 3 year old son. He seemed to like it much more than my wife and me. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney tour. In fact, it cost me a lot to pay attention. The movie looks amazing, but the story becomes so strange and long that I expected my son to fall asleep so I could pick him up and leave. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that the movie is not like that. It is an interesting concept, which is said in a strange way (bad script?), Especially when "we know the family" for the first time. I know we're supposed to give the impression that the family is extravagant, but good sir, they could have shortened that sequence in about 15 minutes (apparently, I did not time it). At that moment I was scratching my head looking for a way out.
