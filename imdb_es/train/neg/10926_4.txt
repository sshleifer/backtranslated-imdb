While the idea is more original than most science fiction movies, the execution is, as usual, missing. While the practical effects of mummies are not bad, and the character of "Gun Nut" is above the inducing laughter, the only real attraction is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin gathered on the small screen. I suspect that was the idea all the time. They do the best they can with what they have, but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes approximately when the character of Morena wore Tomb Raider style shorts. I do not know, but you can not deny the true beauty when you see it. And Adam Baldwin, once again, ruins him as the boy you love to hate. If you just want to see a couple of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub pair material, then this might be for you. If you want a good performance and character development, then we recommend that you look elsewhere.
