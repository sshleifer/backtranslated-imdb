Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've seen in my life. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming that they can do for the older and offended viewers, which for CBC means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and, therefore, terribly foolish, I can not believe it. The performances are very complicated, but I do not blame the actors, since the stereotyped one-dimensional characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. A very unconvincing show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial" and is less controversial than the other boring comedies of CBC like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
