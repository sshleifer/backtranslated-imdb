Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even when it comes to film directors B, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his best films. Yes, it destroys the great story of Poe 'Premature Burial' and yes, it is a bad and uneven rhythm in everything, but it is also quite entertaining. The cry of Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a beautiful and fragile housewife whose useless husband (Jay Richardson) is planning to eliminate her because she needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many of the soft-core movies of the early 1990s, actually gives the best performance in the movie as a slutty lover. You will also enjoy the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a pleasant cameo in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
