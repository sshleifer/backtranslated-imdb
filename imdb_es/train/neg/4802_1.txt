I give this marriage 3 years and that's stretching it. Adrianne Curry has a dirty, spoiled, controlling, noisy mouth, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that she has an image to protect and that she should avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and a different temporal deformation. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will never be happy after finishing. His mother said he was an old cock and believes that this is his last attempt to regain his youth. Here 2 very good people who are going to end up in a nasty divorce. I do not think his old "Brady Family" is going to fit into his new life. I see them being excluded. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported it and was there for him.
