My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Certainly, in the top ten of those that I have seen until the end. At least "Plan 9" was nice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie", and some of their other movies. I was not very interested in "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad in the versions I've seen and I often could not say what people said), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old child. (Do not be offended to 9 year olds). <br /> <br /> Even the "one-line" ones made us moan and they were not even remotely funny.
