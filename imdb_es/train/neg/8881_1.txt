The character's performance is a little stiff, as if it were the first time that the man of the actors appears on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (she played many small roles on television, such as Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and then her performance can be notoriously missed. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, as portrayed by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language most of the time. It does not do a bad job, but it's too much to ask an actor to connect the oceans during a blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and NOT acting. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 films of Spider Man (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The argument is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for his money. from then on, the wife seems to return and harass the husband, driving him crazy until he jumps out of a tall window (fearing that the specter of his dead wife approaches him) on the day when he is expected to die no less. <br /> <br /> The second driver Mr. Ballard hires looks a lot like an English brand Hamill. Incredibly, really! The only thing that stands out is the absolute contempt for dialogue. They spend many minutes in silence, nobody speaks, and few act. It's a shame that the MST3K guys have never taken over this movie. It could have been much better, if not so predictable, with more dialogues, or shorter scenes of "nothing". <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for the red eyes of G'Mork to appear from the shadows and proclaim that Works for the "nothing" that inhabits this film.
