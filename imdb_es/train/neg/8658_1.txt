A large part of the scenes must be cut. There are many scenes that should have been cut. For example, the scene in which hunters mention "I have spiders on my dick", "I like dick", play in the mud scene, or a scene in a bar where the main job of a professional hunter of money is a snake charmer <br /> <br /> What about other scenes terribly incoherent with a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity with a boyfriend who walks like she's wearing three women's panties too small? While they are making love, did they not realize that they are doing it next to the child who will soon flee and lose his head? Why did they do it in a living room? I mean his head really turned around. How about the beach scene that resembles Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene in Grant Lake? All this strange scene could easily be bent and cataloged as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my hometown, cineplex cinemas had been advertising for months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I did not see it. because later I discovered that it was only shown for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The movie was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. Presents the leg of Dinocroc that looks like a child with green pajamas and sneakers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old child. It could easily be overlooked as Baby Geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any student of film creation wants to learn what not to do, it is a true classic trash. As Diane's boyfriend who walks like he has an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who seems drunk even before drinking a beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The man in the panties seemed more interesting than the whole Dinocroc movie. His performance was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comic talent in a science fiction horror movie. Maybe the worst casting in hollywood history.
