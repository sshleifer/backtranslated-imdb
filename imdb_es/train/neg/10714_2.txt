For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was horrible. I overtook it fast and it never got better! Loss of time and loss of money! Tina Fey is a great writer, I thought she would be a great comedian. The previews were great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a girl movie, it stunk. What's up with that? The movie was very slow and boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like to get my money back for this one! BOO of us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people think they're pregnant? I thought it would be fun, I had my own children and I helped others to have children. It could have been more in line with reality.
