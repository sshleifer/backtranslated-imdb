I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not have bothered. As another commentator mentioned, in reality there is not enough horror or eroticism to attract fans of both genders. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free and most of the performances are more or less. Englund was doing everything possible with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a really cool background, but none is enough to carry this movie. This is an adhesive tape. Grade: F
