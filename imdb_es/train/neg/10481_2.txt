The film is poorly translated, except for some old familiar Hollywood names. Other performances by unknown names (ie, Jennifer Gabrielle) are boring. I have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Maybe this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. Although I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid. There are many good movies to watch, and in summary, this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
