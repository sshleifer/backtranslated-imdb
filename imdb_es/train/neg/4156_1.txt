Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that he does not take advantage of his own title! Throughout the movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One could argue that they were trying to "mitigate" it or make it "realistic", but it ends up being boring. More than half of this film takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place in any other place are not too much to show off. Also, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened during the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that for a film with such low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with an original score or music sampled from another part). <br /> <br /> I am in favor of independent films, but it does not seem that this was intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than the Scarecrow Killer".
