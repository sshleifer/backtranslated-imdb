['It&#39;s a bad movie, but I must give it to the main actress in this ... Francine Forbes. It seemed that I acted less and personally I thought it was kind of cute. Too bad it only appears in another movie in the database. On top of that, the movie is full of ridiculous gore and fakey death scenes. People are stabbed and LIKE about 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch bad horror movies, I recommend this highly.']
