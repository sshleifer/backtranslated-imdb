I was supposed to check this for a website, and I saw it with optimism that maybe it would at least be a cheesy but entertaining scam, and it did not even do it well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes that start from "The Omen" without embarrassment. The ending is even very similar to the way "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and history are simply trite. If these films make money, I am sad to see where Asylum is going. It is shameful.
