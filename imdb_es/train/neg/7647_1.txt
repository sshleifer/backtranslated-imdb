Bridges of madison county is a better-made version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not handled with sensitivity as they did in the original English film. This movie is very Indianized, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when the hero dies in the end, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and you think that crying is for the weak that you can not like the end. But in general it is a pretty good subject that is handled well for the conditions of India. Tabu was good as a wife and a loving mother. All acted well.
