With these people faking so many shots, using old images and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed in a set created with actors, what is there to believe? The old country movie is nice, but the animal abuse and the degradation of the natives is painful to see in these films. I know, racism is fine in these old movies, but there is more to make this couple lose credibility. Represented as aviators, they never flew their airplanes, Martin Johnson was a former vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London to obtain financial gains while paying royalties, denying the apparent depression of his wife, using it as a nice accessory, all this makes that these movies unbearable. In no way were they the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. I was fine as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's it.
