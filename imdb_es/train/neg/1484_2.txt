Please, do not rent or think about buying this movie. They do not even have it available in the red box to rent, which would cost $ 1. I think it's worth less than that. The main reason why I rented this movie. It was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2 and 5 minutes. I'll give credit that the movie had hot girls and a bit of nudity, but other than that, you could also buy another horror movie that has the same thing that nobody knows. Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna, and she's not even on the cover of the movie or her name. Time. This movie is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.
