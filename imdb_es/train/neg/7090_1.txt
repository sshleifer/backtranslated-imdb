I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35 pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually direct him, but not last night). I woke up at 3 in the morning (invesment banker on the west coast), and I was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was surprised how poor this "movie" was. Seriously. shocked. So surprised that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really very bad. The writing is boring, but the direction and editing are simply below those of a freshman in a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a video filmed. Of course, that is filmed in VIDEO, not in DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The clips on the skateboard videos have a more 'cinematic' feel than the horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the poor address, but honestly I can not remember anything. The shots and the blocks are stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid". Not unconventional, not daring, not daring, not boring, just stupid. I know that people who review this review will say "give me an example". I can not It was 3 in the morning. But trust me, I know you will see it anyway, you will be attracted by the horrible criticism. <br /> <br />
