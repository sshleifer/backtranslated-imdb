An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson who cleaned the "scum" that assaulted his parents, grandparents or something, and impressed young people with his karate skills. In a pivotal scene, she intervenes to stop a rape and an imbecile policeman puts her in jail, so after a couple of cool shower scenes and a bit of abortive seduction from the prison levee, she has to take the law in their own hands, blah, blah, blah. I suppose there were many movies like this one? The script is dumber than normal if you can believe it. Mani appears exactly as the kind of entertainment show that would co-produce his own lead role in Death Wish, and I think that guy is sporadically appealing, but the movie is an unpleasant device. Competent agents would be wasted in the slag papers here and would actively undermine the fantastic incompetent DA and the judge who has to be the producer's uncle.
