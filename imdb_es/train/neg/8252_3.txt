What was with the sound? It sounded as if it were bent. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, sex scenes - bad / credible. <br /> <br /> Even so, we saw it to the end in disbelief. How could a good roll of actors act so badly? Will they ever get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave him 3 because at least we were attracted to see him until the end due to his strange plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And for the oldest critic, I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the forties. How was it done in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, there were some bits OK. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a good boat. Jennifer looked good in a little suit. But how is it that the sister has all the men?
