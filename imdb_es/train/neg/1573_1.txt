How this piece of garbage went to film is beyond me. The only actor I know is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is nothing more than a justification for putting him into production. <br /> <br /> I do not even think it's worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really makes B movies a cinematic enjoyment. A car that travels along the highway with the police in tow, and nobody knows how to stop it, yes, to the right. <br /> <br /> The script must be written on the back of a cigarette box. Most television movies are horrible, but this redefines the word. Check out the bridge operator's acting skills, pure Oscar material.
