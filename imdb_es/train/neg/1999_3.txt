At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to register the case for posterity. For a good reason! The super detective left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, nor a sharp analysis of the signs in crime scenes. Holmes staggers fifty meters behind the plot. Finally, the evil CAM is treated by a frail old man, in a way that would have made Charles Bronson's heart fill with pride: six bullets in the bread basket. In a subsequent chase, a pursuer takes one of Watson's shoes. Do not decide to bet on Cinderella's story to extend the movie. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, escape free. Well, it's a change of pace in late Victorian London. A little about the law of the six weapons :-)
