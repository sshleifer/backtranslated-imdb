Battlestar Gallactica was great because she had good writing, a great appearance, excellent actors and interesting stories ... And yes, there were hot men and women going in and out of uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy Lazy writing. Actors smoking a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, that's a Ford Focus in the background). A lot of teenage angst. A lot of naked women turning (but in the background, what I'm sure will be cut for the series) and a symbolic view of some men on towels. None of the actors, except Polly Walker, caught my attention. At an hour and a half, I still wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> So, what exactly is it supposed to bring back? Science fiction? It is very light in that. Actors? In addition to the good turn of Polly Walker, here is not much interesting. There are not even "beauties" in the cast, except perhaps Esai, although for the younger group it is quite old, as it is more than 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short run as a series, unless you actually sharpen your pencils in SciFi and get to work to do this more than The OC on another planet.
