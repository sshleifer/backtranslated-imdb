In the first place, the big name actors must need the money ... The surgical scenes were fun ... and surely they should know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this absolutely absurd ... Anesthesiologists do not leave of the room during a heart transplant ... nor do the surgery in a small room without instruments, heart-lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not concentrate on the story because of all the stupid scenes of surgery ... without blood, without personnel and then the hero doc who enters and takes over ... is not a film for thinking adults ... In addition, the budget must have been limited ... the scenes from the street they were fine, but who was the technical advisor ... It looks like it was run by a total idiot. Save your money and wait for it to appear on DVD and do not rent it.
