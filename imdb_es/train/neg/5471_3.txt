The typical garbage-toss, this 80's movie is considered one of the "highlights" of the notorious Lloyd Kaufman production studio, along with "The Toxic Avenger" released a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is much higher if you ask me, but this demented splash hit is also bearable; just make sure you leave all your brain power at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small city that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly do not lie. The safety precautions at the local nuclear power plant are deficient, to say the least (even Homer Simpson was never so indifferent) and the toxic waste seeps into the nearby high school. The first victim intoxicated is the stereotyped nerd, who begins to expel green things from all the cavities of his body, but it is believed that his death is an accident because he had no less than TWO microwave ovens in his house! Oh humanity! Shortly after, however, nuclear leaks also affect the weed planting of the school and things really start to get dirty. After smoking a joint at a party, the cutest couple in the school produces a giant monster of worms that sits in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is a horror movie in the background, with silly dialogues that hurt your ears and makeup effects that give a new meaning to the word without flavor. If you like to see how the faces melt, crush or split in half, it's definitely a must! Unlike the aforementioned "The Axic Avenger", this film suffers from a couple of really boring and long moments in which nothing really significant happens, such as when Chrissy and Warren try to discover what is wrong with their hormones. Raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and acting performances are unforgivably amateurish. Proceed only if you are an avid Troma fan.
