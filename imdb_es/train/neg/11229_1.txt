They made me see this at school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. The episodes become confusing because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about this as a gift, but in reality it was a painfully boring experience. I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them do what they do in the movie in real life. This explains cheesy acting very often. In addition, very often the story becomes slightly outrageous and outlandish. I do not like the way some of the lines were written and I wish they had more meaning for them. Although, it was written to be educational, fun, suspenseful and modern, it ended up being boring, dry, crazy and old. I hope no one takes the time to see this movie because you would be fine if you did not see it.
