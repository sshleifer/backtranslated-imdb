This is for the Zatoichi films as were the "Star Trek" films for "Star Trek", except that in this case each of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this great brilliant re-do, and also better done , If the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, it would have seemed attractive but empty; since I had it, I found its style and its insufficient content inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character in a larger and more polished production must have sounded good, but it made no sense, apart from the hope of making money; it's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and completely fails to take the character to a place where he has not yet been (also, the actor was not at his best). I expected to see Ichi in an advanced stage of life, in a story that would gracefully see him and draw some conclusion from his experience in general; this only repeats fragments of other movies, seasoned with more sex and sfx violence. It is not the same experience at all.
