I am a Christian and I say that this film had a terrible performance, unreal situations and a front fa√ßade completely for Christianity. You could also watch "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a football movie as a formula steroid for the losers. Allow me to make some really urgent comments about what bothered me in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and it was a white academy school. I did not notice a single black student or player at school. Deal with the "Christian" White Academies in the south and they were built for the sole reason of restoring segregation. This is worrisome when the film is about Christianity and Christ changing lives ... how about changing the hearts of segregation? (Note: I loved the token black coach, as if it was made up of the completely white team and all the black players of the 'Giants'). <br /> <br /> 2. The uncritical acclamation of all Christians about this film. Can I make a couple of people say it was a bad performance, bad filming, poor writing and, in short, a misinterpretation compared to other films? If we compare this with another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-Christianity that was shown made less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. If Christianity is simply about reading a small scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then do not ask yourself when nobody will hear what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a panacea. He does not need to be sold and does not need to be tied to such whimsical lifestyles. It is not surprising that everyone considers Christianity to be anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I recognize that this film can be inspiring for some people. For most, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of sincere struggle and tension. The most important thing to me, is not Christian in any way or stretch. It has values, but it falls short as a message of "drag yourself by the bootstraps" as superficial as a positive thought. If you live with people struggling and / or living conditions of the third world, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.
