Although he had seen "Gymkata" in a theater in '85, he could not remember anything of the plot except the vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the end. <Br /> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I got a copy of the newly released DVD to enter the world of Gymkata again. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is one of those films produced during the 80s that would go directly to today's video. The movie star, champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, was recruited out of nowhere to infiltrate the nation of "Parmistan" to enter and, hopefully, win "The Game", a suicidal blood sport sponsored by the Khan that encourages its people by shouting what it sounds like. "Yak Power". The objective of the mission is the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained try to mingle with the locals wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white stripes. It goes without saying that Cabot is running and fighting for his life on the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a rendezvous with destiny and the Game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas was not attended to by director Robert Clouse, who seems to have never been on set. The so-called script is just this side of incompetent. See other comments for the many howlers in all. The city of the crazy has some good moments, but finally it is ruined by a bad edition. The end ... meh. There is still the germ of a good action adventure here. A version of Hong Kong with more visceral action and a faster pace could be quite good.
