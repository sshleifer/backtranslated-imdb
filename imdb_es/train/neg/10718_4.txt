Come on Tina Fey, you can do better than this. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Of course, sometimes it was fun. Even laughing loudly funny But there are not enough laughs to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At the most I recommend renting it but that's it. Baby Mama has some fun scenes, but it is predictable and does not make the end so comforting. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did well in that and they did well in this. But this is not the best. Baby Mama had a great cast of support. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the greatness of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another movie about pregnancy has reached the world of cinema. After the big Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average in comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are hilarious, comforting and have ends that leave you with a smile on your face. The end of Baby Mama was casual and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and does not try to be. I recommend it but I do not expect it to be totally hilarious. Expect an average comedy that does not give the emotional end that you try to have. I give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
