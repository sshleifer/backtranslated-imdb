First of all I must admit Batman: the animated series is the best batman series at the moment. We saw it when I used to be on TV. I did not realize there was a fourth season. Actually there was not. BTAS ends season 3, and should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to mess with something good? Catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker seems beyond fear, it seems that every time they check their appearance it looks increasingly creepy. It seems that he no longer has students, and now he does not even seem remotely human (although he is). <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy is the one who expresses Kevin Wayne, who makes the best batman. Although now he looks like superman. There is nothing that differentiates him because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred only has pupils of the eyes, he looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I have seen three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there are blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a Batman fan: The animated series, there's no Batman season 4. They just included this series as season 4 for commercialization. If they launched it as The New Batman Adventures, I do not think many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3.
