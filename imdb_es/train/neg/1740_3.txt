The movie was a big disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such bleak standards. Bad scripts (almost nonexistent) and sequences of songs with bad songs every minute and in the strangest moments killed the humor that the film could offer. Some of the scenes were fun, but probably lasted only 5 minutes of the entire duration. The edition was pathetic. Sad! In general, the film disappointed because the lack of history was too obvious. In fact, only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. <br /> <br /> One would not miss anything if he does not see the movie. It's not worth spending valuable money on this movie. wait for him to appear on TV ...
