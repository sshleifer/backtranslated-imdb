['I grew up with Scooby (a little repetition of where you are). I hate Scrappy, I love Daphne, and I feel it&#39;s not complete without the whole gang. But this is sad, Scooby Doo is a mystery that solves the comedy, it is not totally bad the Japanese anime of spies. I like &quot;what&#39;s new&quot;, they had to give Daphne a makeover, prone to danger at some point :( and try to lose the &quot;sex&quot; drug jokes of many generations, but this &quot;get a clue&quot; It&#39;s not easy at all Scooby&#39;s name is attached They even tried to do something lame with the theme Now I&#39;m going to watch my Scooby Doo DVD Where are you to take the dirt out of this new series?']
