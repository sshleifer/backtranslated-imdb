- Bad Stuff: this movie is a real shit. Bad tricks for one thing, they looked so fake that I thought this was "The Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are pretty useless. A part of the movie that believes that eliminating your anger in a window will make your life better. I want to meet the casting director and if he was tall because the acting, even of the adults, was horrible. A scene of kisses in this movie even stunk. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good Stuff: I do not know what I can really say. There are some suspense parts that set it in motion, but they are quickly brought down by bad work and bad acting. <br /> <br /> - My Verdict: Do not look.
