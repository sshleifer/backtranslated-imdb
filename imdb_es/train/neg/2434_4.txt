Realistic film, of course, except for the fact that the characters do not seem to be afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not seem to do it. That's why I do not like his acting in this movie. Tom Berenger is playing a soldier again. There is no good emotion, realistic sequences. I do not always throw, that's a great thing. Well filmed I hate the sequence of the helicopter, because only one terrorist kills almost all the marine group ... I give it ** and a half of *****
