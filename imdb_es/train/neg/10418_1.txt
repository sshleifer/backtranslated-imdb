THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under 5 years old. For a month my 4-year-old son would occasionally ask me "Why did the rabbit bleed by mouth" or "Why did the excavator bury all the rabbits?" (And that was not the worst). We stopped it for about 1/2 hour but the damage was done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he has finally forgotten everything unfortunate. Whoever has decided that this movie should be marketed for children, should be charged with charges. ... (go ahead, censure me, my conscience is clear).
