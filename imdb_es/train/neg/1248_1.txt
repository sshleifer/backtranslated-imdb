This movie was bad because it was not interesting at all. It was a kind of remake but, again, not really. I was very disappointed to consider the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. I had great makeup and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie that was made for less than $ 6 million? Hell no. So, in that sense, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the scene of the Statue of Liberty was shocking, but there was nothing surprising in this movie, not even in the final scene, because you could see it. coming. And, by the way, if you think about it, and I did, you can find out how the end could come. I wish I had spent the time I had lost thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been brilliant and fun if it had stayed in line with the first film and had adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Monkeys". This is how I would have written it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (really should have been more than Marky Mark because he is not good enough to take care of a movie by himself, so he would have put in three types) that they would land on what they thought would be another planet, they would find humans (not mute), a city ruled by monkeys, they would be hunted, they made friends with some good apes, they discover that they are on the earth finding some destroyed ruins, they end up crashing crazy mutant humans living under the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination fly on how you want to end it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could be a lot more in this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy something good. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director despite what people think. It's fashionable, so it must be good, thought goes. Sorry but no. If someone else had made this movie, it would have been much better and would have been much more satisfying.
