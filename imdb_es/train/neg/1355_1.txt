I saw "What is it?" From Crispin Glover at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. It is true that the film had at least one appropriate name, because I had the clear feeling that even the writer / director could not answer. In the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally intended to be a short movie to show the virtue of using actors with down syndrome. However, this is not enough reason to create a movie. In my opinion, the actors are building blocks for a broader vision, a broader vision that seemed confusing at best and absent in the worst case. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to tackle taboo subjects. Well, he does that. But why? The film seems to have no position, there is no reason to approach anything. Do you feel that these things should not be taboo? The movie does not even give me an indicator of that. Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting. You can not even afford to make the taboo annoying or annoying at any level because it has not made the audience worry in any way. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the problems with the concept for a moment, what surprised me the most was how badly the movie was put on. The editing, cinematography and other technical aspects seemed to be extremely amateurish. Glover said that between 125 and 150 thousand dollars went into the film, and I think the money should have been spent on different designers (Glover made some designs himself, I know I saw at least one sound design in the credits). The painted sets are fine (they are not great), but they are misused. The parts feel like a photographed play, which would be fine if it were for some purpose, but in the hands of Glover he feels neglected. Other parts are recorded as a kind of home movie, of inferior quality to many of the things I see that new filmmakers do in iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" I just can not even understand how seriously the film should be taken. There are some parts where it seems that Glover is screaming at you to think seriously. At other points, it seems off in its own little joke. Maybe I wanted this to be ironic or meaningful in some way, but I just felt that Glover could not even pay serious attention to his movie. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film If only it had been. At seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of images and ideas in the first twenty, and it is debatable whether the ideas were formulated enough to affirm that they were there during that period of time.
