I probably see 200 films a year, both in theaters and at home, and I can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst I've seen this year (if at any time, however, I have not seen "The Search"). of the Knights of the Delta "still). This movie is just a bad joke after a bad joke directed at 13 year olds and because I did not like to see it on a bus trip, I could not get out. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this One in the rental hall. The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by the numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
