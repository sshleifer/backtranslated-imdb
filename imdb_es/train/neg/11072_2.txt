Last night I saw on television last night. Yes, I can hear what they say about this. It is likely to be classified as one of those stereoscopic television series. To be fair, the story line has a good twist, and you could nod, saying, "Well, that's not what I expected." But, as a movie, well, it is not easy to detect a redeeming element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costumes, setting, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. Â¿Classified R? Oh, that scene. We need it? This is a movie that you can see and then forget that you even saw it. And what was the title again?
