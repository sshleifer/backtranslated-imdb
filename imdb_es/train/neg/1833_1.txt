Please, have someone stop Ben Stiller from acting on ANY movie. Write the studies, hell, write even to your local congressman. I have more laughs at a funeral and then I have seen ANY Stiller movie. Jack Black tries to do something about a comedy about the disappearance of dog shit, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the best actors of his generation, simply seems embarrassed to be there. Stiller does not have his own personality, but now even with someone who rescues him, he shows that he is too overrated as a comedian. No wonder why this movie collapsed so badly, and was available in the dollar theaters after a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, do not watch this movie, it's just horrible, worse than Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say that), worse Plan 9, Worse Ishtar, worse then the golden boy. Please, Hollywood, stop allowing Ben Stiller in your movies, it's not funny, he's a horrible actor and he's taking others with him. The next movie was ranked 1 because negative scores are not allowed, so while the board says one, I'll give it a zero.
