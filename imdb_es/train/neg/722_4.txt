One scene shows quite well the mentality of "Terminator Woman": Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. Karen encounters an armed guard, who points her gun at her, but after a few seconds she shoots her and challenges her to fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, raises the gun and flees! Then, again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of your family, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble have some funny jokes from the start, and the movie could have been better if it had focused more on their love and hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they separate, and the film becomes slower, and even with the occasional fight scene to animate things, it lacks emotion. The ending has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd is going to play a womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden in a speedboat, but the fights are interspersed in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value. On the positive side, congratulations to the costume department for giving Karen the opportunity to show off a spectacular neckline throughout the film! (* 1/2)
