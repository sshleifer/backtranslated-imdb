This is a really horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is totally indecipherable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not entirely sure). <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of useless clich√©s. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of "southern" accents that (fortunately) the words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the film's only real tragedy is that such a historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such financial or personal circumstances that it appeared in her. <br /> <br />
