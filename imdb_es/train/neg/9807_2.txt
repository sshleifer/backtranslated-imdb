Very rarely I give less favorable reviews in a program or movie that I do not like in IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is terribly terrible, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> I would not have minded if this had been like this. an animated series would have been better that way, I suppose, but as a live action program, it typifies the terms "corny" and "campy". Of which Power Rangers is. Five multicolored teenagers, wearing spandex, fight against evil using their martial arts skills. The disguises are horrible, they seem like something that would be used by track and field athletes and gymnasts. The acting is pitiful, and the choreography of the fight is so surprisingly bad and so unconvincing to see that it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which is a euphemism in itself. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing; As if it were a version of the 'Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, instead of fighting. In addition, there are some cartoons that present a lot of martial arts and, however, are done in a fun way, but not so cheesy that makes it seem silly. on the edge of the absurd. And even though this version is established in the United States, you might be forgiven for thinking that seeing some of the fight sequences were not filmed in the United States, but in Japan; therefore, fights and somewhat "false" images were taken from the Japanese version, only to be juxtaposed to the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, stay with Sentai, the Japanese equivalent.
