I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my criticism and most of the rules definitively: This movie is horrible! From acting to non-realistic animation to innumerable mistakes. I hoped that the fins would have been extended by a little imagination (the fins can not be extended without engines). The landing gear can not be lowered unless it has electricity. That little fan that was going was not enough by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The only thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the rear wheels touched down and then the nose broke, thus suspending the plane with the two rear tires in the air. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to the tires that were not touching the ground? Did you forget the spoilers? Address the director: find out * everything * you can about airplanes before trying a "flat" movie. Sorry for the technical tirade, but I give this movie 1/10.
