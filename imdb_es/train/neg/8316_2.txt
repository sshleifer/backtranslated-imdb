Cedric Kahn's films have been based on characters, rather than actions (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's surprising to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some attempts to give character to Succo . . I do not find Stefano Cassetti as an interesting actor; It reminds me of professional athletes who are persuaded in movies, like Bret Favre. That blank look looks like a very cruel deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on the personality of Succo, instead of admiring his ability to steal cars. <br /> <br /> The small performance there comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the schoolgirl in need that Succo takes by storm. The interview in the police office is a marvel of insipid stubbornness with a bit of fear for the mixed future. Apart from Le Besco, there is not much to recommend this movie.
