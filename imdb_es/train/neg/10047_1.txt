Now I have written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is one of the worst. An interesting premise is abandoned at the beginning when the credits accumulate. If you see people things that you never enjoy in real life ("Let's see the basement!"), Then this is your program. Except that it's not fun or entertaining, it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The spread of the virus is never shown. I can ignore the fact that it only affects men, since the resulting situation is very, very frightening. But then things deteriorate as his daughter leaves her father OBVIOUSLY disturbed in the house and finally dies in his hands. The woman flees north, and is in a few dozen. So, some kind of spirit or alien or something appears and saves it (things that make you HUH?). Or something. Then, she is curled up by the heat. The end. <br /> <br /> Horrible. These directors are sending this email on.
