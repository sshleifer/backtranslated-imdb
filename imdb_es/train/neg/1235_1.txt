I really wanted to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and the masks are great, but that's the only good aspect of the movie. All the other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he's just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: monkeys lie unconscious on the ground, but humans do not attack them, no, they wait until they get up again! This is just an example of the stupid story, but it would take a long time to tell them all.
