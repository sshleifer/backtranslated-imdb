I'm working on the collection of the movie package Chilling Classics 50 and THE WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (The Witches' Mountain) is something like the 17th movie on the set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to do with this. keep my attention at all The plot was incoherent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The performance was poor. The characters were not sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scenario is the beginning, with an exasperated woman who is forced to burn her apparently spoiled daughter. However, the only connection that this scene has with the rest of the movie is the main character, Mario, who has the most wonderful mustache of all. But, that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It really is barely visible, what else can I say?
