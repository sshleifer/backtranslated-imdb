The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was nice to see and I wanted to see the inevitable that was happening between them. However, once the action changed to the house of Ingrid's boyfriend, everything collapsed completely. Instead of romance and charm, we see some unbearably silly parallel characters that ruin the movie. The bored son of the groom and the military attach√© competing for the maid's attention seemed stupid, something like a secondary plot of an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to dopism surpasses me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recover the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, since the film is very similar once the action changes to the farm of the country (as in the other movie). I was not a big fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN made me appreciate the art and nuances of the original movie.
