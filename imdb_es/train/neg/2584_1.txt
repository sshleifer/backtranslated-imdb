Then, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American Pie movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the three original films of American Pie, except that some of the characters must be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that guy get better concerts?) . <br /> <br /> There is very little to complement this movie. There are no funny jokes. The performance is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent, which is more like the personification of a Canadian from a British woman who claims to be a person from the hill using the word "ya'll". This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why did not I sign up at a university where no one attends classes (but everyone gets good grades), girls take off their clothes in public constantly, all have promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and Can they ejaculate anyway? Photos of a girl's family without caring? Actually, this series has been downgraded to softcore porn standards. Maybe for the next one, they will finally collapse and hire Ron Jeremy as leader. I'm sure you can only link it to the series by making the third guy of your character, Stifler, once removed or something like that.
