This DVD seems to be aimed at someone who will simply put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos of the Grand Canyon with several pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD's music is boring and the transfer to DVD seems rather fuzzy and tenuous. A DVD too expensive for what it is.
