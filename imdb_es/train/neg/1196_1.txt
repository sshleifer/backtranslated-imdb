How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have NOTHING funny? Believe it or not, 'House Bunny' made this better and more fun. With luck, the directors had a good vacation and got some money; This movie is a shame for everyone. It's a cliché from start to finish. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least with an idea. This film does not do more than cliché after cliche instead of ideas or scripts. Use the preexisting characters of the actresses instead of developing characters. Bad, sad, and trash. Now apparently I have to have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT operations manager, this is another example of careless coding.
