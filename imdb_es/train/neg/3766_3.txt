I went to see this movie knowing that it was not going to be great. but what I witnessed was horrible for the words. I do not want to be hard, it's just that the movie was terrible. In general, it was bad, I mean the INCREDIBLE special effects, the performance was not so bad, but it was not good either, and the sasquatch itself was like ... well, not the sasquatch. In my opinion, the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Henderson. It is not violent or horrific, but it has the best representation of sasquatch. At least it's a suit and not a half CGI scam. Just watch this movie if you're desperate or if you really appreciate someone in the movie. or go see santos boondock, it's MUCH better.
