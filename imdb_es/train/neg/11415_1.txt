Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a scrap piece full of clich√©s. A high school comedy prepared in a military training camp. Sorry, I had to give this 1 star that I did not deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Almost everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. The HEPO (military police) will not come looking for you if you do not show up, especially on your wedding day. The actors were quite embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work as it was very unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not such bad actors, they could not have saved the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the boy has to exercise with his wedding suit. No, there was not time to give him a uniform first. Man, this is a great cinematography! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them even a model, although it does not look so good - and the worst The actress I've ever seen. I doubt that in Hollywood you will be allowed to say a single line in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Good girls in the army! Now this is getting fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they would be located in a different building a quarter of a mile away, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available that we can use for a fun trip in our free time, of which we have many. No, the tanks are not blocked and the ignition keys are inserted. Nobody will notice the sounds of the engine, especially at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of sex scenes and references and they are all under the waste line. We need those so that sexually obsessed Germans like the movie too. Switzerland is too small a market for any movie. Well done! <br /> <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely, none of those facilities is ever locked. Military routines are as careless as they can be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the brainless movie, the mafia hit men are about to take revenge on the poor man who tries to shoot him. Because he abandoned his fiancee! Of course I buy that, the Italians are like that, a jealous group (no). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do this in broad daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, the military training camps (where live ammunition is fired) are open to the public, anyone can drive or walk freely there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However, good action is avoided when the good captain timely launches a rocket to the Italians' car. The explosion knocks down the sicarios and the promised fury. No one who is 40 feet away gets hurt when the car is blown up to the men's points. It's a COMEDY, remember. <br /> <br /> It's fine. It's a comedy, I have it, and I can live with that. No realism is needed. Filmmakers can easily agree with this if it's hilariously fun, fun or entertaining, interesting and challenging. Unfortunately, it's nothing like that. It is simply embarrassing. A scam of American comedies without a brain. The latter are, at least, professionally done, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It is quite boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who sit in the whole movie as I unfortunately did. Yawn.
