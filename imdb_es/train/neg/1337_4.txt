Yes, you guessed it. Another movie where identical twins change places. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older, they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like 'Full House' replays. If you plan to watch this movie, do not do it. See 'The parents' trap' instead. It is more entertaining.
