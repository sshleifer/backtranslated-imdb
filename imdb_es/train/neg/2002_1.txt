A trembling hand camera was used, probably to give a documentary aspect to the film, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to feel nauseous from the movement just to see it. It seemed that someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (do not be offended for the PC sufferers, but I do not think you expect to work much as a cinematographer!) The work of the camera was so nauseating and so distracted that my wife and I consider it unappealable and we abandon it after 10 minutes of torture. I checked it a little later (it was being watched on TV), and nothing had improved. I suggest you avoid this unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you have eaten!
