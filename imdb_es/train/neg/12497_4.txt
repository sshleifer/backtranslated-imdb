I'm sure that people on the Texas / Louisiana border should have had a good laugh or two when Paramount's B-imaging unit inflicted this on public in wartime. Very simply, the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is a cotton country like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South was post-Civil War. There are no great cattle empires there, they are much further west than Texas, beyond what Richard Dix and Preston Foster could mount to establish their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the two companions in a fluvial boat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal his services by not paying them to transport his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that is the beginning of the great Ponderosa as the ranch where they begin. <br /> <br /> On the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford, and fights with her much smaller neighbors. They also have more opportunities with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Anyway, we Orientals who like Westerns generally do not bother with the geographical stuff and it's still a good western from the Harry Sherman production factory that produced all those Cassidy westerns from Hopalong for Paramount. The climax is fiery, and I mean literally, the battle of weapons that should have been used in a production A. <br /> <br /> But I would not have anyone but Western zealots to see it.
