If you thought that the original of 83 was bad, then try this modern masterpiece. How could what you ask be worse? Well ... at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy running in a sports bra. Apart from up-to-date graphics, current-day issues (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a new and attractive voice for Ripley, unfortunately this is the same sad story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / story line was going. And for anyone who has not seen the first one ... well, consider yourself fortunate to have seen it only once. Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.
