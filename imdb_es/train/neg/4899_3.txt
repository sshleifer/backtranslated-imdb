After the teenage girlfriend of Harry Reems is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems feels dejected and consoles having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a cane and dresses like a magician, rapes some more women. Finally, Reems decides to track him down and end his wave of crimes. Despite being filmed and marginally unpleasant, it looks like any other porn of the 70 and runs inept. The scenes of rape / abuse are surprisingly restricted and the attempt to take advantage of "Death Wish" is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a policeman. Colt, who is usually exaggerated, fights in a couple of scenes, but he behaves very well for my money. This rude could have been much rougher.
