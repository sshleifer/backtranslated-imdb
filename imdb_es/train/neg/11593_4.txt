I consider this movie to be one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember anything 20 minutes after the movie ended, I even got tired of writing a review about it. <br /> <br /> Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the prankster. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to film a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add suspense and fear. Because of that, Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is not funny or scary. What we really get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy killing Lisa's friends using the dreams of Lisa's unborn baby) has a good Base but it's not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (maybe because there is not) and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming for. The script must have had more holes than Swiss cheese and, therefore, the movie was very cheesy (let me tell you that I do not like cheese, even if it's from Switzerland). Even special effects were not as good as in part 4, for example. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to rent / buy this movie if it's not complete, it's a disaster. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also a mess ...)
