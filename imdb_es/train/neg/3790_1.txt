I do not really post comments, but I wanted to make sure to warn people about this movie. It is an unfinished student film that does not present redeeming features at all. At a technical level, it is completely amateur: constant editions of involuntary jumps within scenes, dubbing at high speed, etc. The plot is completely clich√©, the structure is ridiculous and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too harsh: I've done my share of student films, and they were all horrible, but there's no reason for this movie to go out into the world where innocent fans will have to see it. <Br /> <br /> Assured that, like the cast, the positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
