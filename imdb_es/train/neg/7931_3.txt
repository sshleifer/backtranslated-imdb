The explosion of television channels must be eternally grateful to Randolph Scott's western production line, because at any moment there must be one of what appear to be one hundred Randolph Scott films that play in at least one season without a budget. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind The Gun" is a melodrama typical of the early 1950s with pre-World War II production values ​​that is based on a historically topical murder mystery plot dotted with scenes of action to disguise the total absence of character development of the script, and therefore lack of suspense. In the next few years, the role of these films will be taken over by television programs such as 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. - and these really did the job better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly annoyed at this, is the good guy, who fights against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail. There is no more interest in what he experiences emotionally than in what his horse feels, unless he has to wonder if he will solve the initial misunderstanding with the female protagonist at the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than the performance. But it's fine if that floats your boat; and I will not reprimand you for enjoying 'Diagnosis, Murder'. <br /> <br /> Worker, pedestrian and fast aging. 3 stars for competing together; 0 for artistic effort.
