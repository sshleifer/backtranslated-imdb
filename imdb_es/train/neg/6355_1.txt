I could not wait to see this movie. Halfway through the movie, I could not wait for it to end. All the actors (white) were handing out their lines as Woody Allen had just said: "Say it like this ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks, and he does not stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comic part of this movie was as boring as the tragedy and, definitely, it's never funny or entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of Woody Allen, and this movie has definitely not converted me. I think his writing was as bad as his address. This movie will become one of the worst 10 movies I've seen.
