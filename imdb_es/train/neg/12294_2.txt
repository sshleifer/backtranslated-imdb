I saw this movie purely because of the scenery. It was filmed in an old hotel where a friend owns shares. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediocre at best, the fears were all disgusting, not true fears. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much of the plot, and I think that's because there was not 'There's a lot of one to remember. They did not even use the hotel to its full potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually a strange place early in the morning or late at night, when the wind howls through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is with the remote control in hand so you can move quickly through the action scenes (and I am using that term freely) and stop at the beauty of the environment.
