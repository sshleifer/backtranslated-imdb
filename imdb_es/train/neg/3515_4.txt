Basically a typical propaganda movie for the last good war. But there were a couple of things that struck me. First was the use of articulated epithets. In two cases, Scott's character says one, once at the beginning when he throws his bomb out of the target during the bomb ("curse") and once when he tries to convince a bomber to be a pilot ("s *% t "). I could be wrong with the second instance, but I repeated it several times and that's what I think. The third case is when the character of Anne Shirley says goodbye and good luck to the character of O'Brien ("Dale hell") about the roar of the engines. She must have thought it was very unladylike because it clearly says "devils". I also found interesting the character who has moral problems with the bombing, specifically the bombing of civilians. The superior avuncular officer assures you that only military targets will be achieved due to the precision of the sight of the bomb used. Considering what we know about LeMay's subsequent strategy of bombing Japanese cities to oblivion, this scene plays with no little irony. I remember that McNamara quoted LeMay in "The Fog of War," something to the effect that if the United States did not win the conflict, he would be judged a war criminal. The ending is excessive, according to the movie. It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (I'm not comparing movies, only the ending!). Maybe it's just because he's bloated. It exploded very well!
