I could not believe what I saw when I saw Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the background of the Nuremberg trials becomes clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last minutes of the first part of the series, the audience can see more. Shocking and horrible images that I have seen. <br /> <br /> It is important that people see these images (although I do not agree with people who claim that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed). to this kind of material), but in this movie it was completely ridiculous. It was purely intended to improve the impact of an ordinary television series. It was meant to surprise the public, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move around with well-done scenes, inspirational dialogues or interesting views, the public is being tortured with horrible images of the inmates of the fur and bone camps. It does not show any respect for the victims of the holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
