No stage, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give a budget of this kind to do this ... In Belgium, we make ten films that win all the prices in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director graduated from a school movie or a police officer? <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the word "End". . <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell this? 1รง is too expensive. <br /> <br /> I've paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, paying for this was my BIG MILLENNIUM ERROR. <br /> <br /> Very badly. <br /> <br /> Next time I will break my arm but I will buy this type of sh * t.
