The basic premise of this film is a political caricature. I guess for those who do not know anything about the realities of the military, this is probably a "welfare" movie about gender equality. In fact, a recent commentator said: "it allows women to know that they can do whatever they want". What a trap! No one, man or woman can do what they want, and unfortunately, Demi Moore is "preparing" SEAL Children's Week at the beginning of the week of the 27-week BUD / S program in a few sessions at the local gymnasium and only her desire to be a SEAL simply is not going to do it that way. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what could be said to be the most difficult military training program: they are those who leave voluntarily, can not compete physically, suffer frequent physical injuries during training or can not handle the psychology. bullying. I never got beyond the superficiality of the intended and pretended message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not last the first 24 hours in this hard and sustained physical training. Wishing alone will not do it. Skip this movie as if it were an illusion, and spend more time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York, 2001) to get the best description of what really happens in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
