The Russian film, "4", follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet at a local bar one night. One is a musician, another a seller of frozen meat and the other a prostitute. <br /> <br /> "4", I suppose, is meant to show the sadness and despair of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have invented stories to make their lives seem more interesting than they really they are), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people can sit through it. There seems to be a suggestion in the film that the grim Russian government is doing some hidden things behind the scenes: operating secret cloning facilities, selling frozen meat for decades, etc., but the film is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt it. anyone could understand what he is really doing here. <br /> <br /> Despite the decent performance and some incisively directed scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
