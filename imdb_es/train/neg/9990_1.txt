After having seen this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a group of fans who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of strange occurrences, or "delights," as the friend who reads on my shoulder tells me. It is not worth commenting on the plot, but basically a plane carrying soccer players crashes in the territory of Yeti. Before the film is over, Yetis is invited to tear hearts, Yetis swirls in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, Yetis is tearing off a man's legs and beating him with them, a woman who kills a 30 meters rabbit with a javelin. , the yeti survived several bullets and was burned without apparent damage, the yeti hung from a cliff holding a man's shoe, but then jumped, and a whole collection of strange and strange events. Basically, if you do not stay up on a Saturday for the express purpose of seeing the worst of the original SciFi channel movies, avoid this movie like the plague. Or as my friend says he reads on my shoulder: "It's the best movie I've seen." To which the friend to my right says: "Only techno battle music could have done better."
