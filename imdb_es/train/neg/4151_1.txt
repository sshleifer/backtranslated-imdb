This is probably the best horror movie made since the death of Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> I can not ruin the end, because I have no idea what happened. Although I will do the best I can. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they are still exchanging bodies, so any character may or may not be the character you're supposed to think he is, or he could be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since, to begin with, none of the characters makes any sense. There is no plot, there is no development of characters, and people appear at random, speak a few lines and then disappear, so as not to be heard again. There are also zombies, which are * possibly * enemies of vampires, but there is also a dream sequence in a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe none of this happened in reality, and everything is the hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> The rise? The two leading girls take off their shirts briefly. The special effects are simply amazing (I particularly liked the incredibly slow and awkward fighting sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> It's worth the rental price. we laugh until we cry.
