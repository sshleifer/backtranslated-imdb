What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to lead, and I am Kazaam! A genius that raps? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park are in a movie like this. I remember that I saw this only to kill time. I really was not interested. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie?" The whole story also seemed stupid. It did not make any sense at all. I suppose an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so terrible that there is nothing worth commenting on. "I wish" that this movie leaves.
