Okay, I saw the preview of this stupid movie. In the first place, the film is presented and it is not real, they all act. They can not sing They are too full of themselves. It is awful. Yes, children from 8 to 10 years can enjoy, but it is really stupid. I mean they say that their manager is a child. And there the record label is fake. It is stupid. I do not see it. <br /> <br /> As for the configuration and the address, it's not too bad. It's a nice documentary but it documents something stupid. <br /> <br /> Just see this if you really do not like good music. Also, it's very cheesy. It is not even in good taste. I hate being so cruel ... but this really is a piece of junk.
