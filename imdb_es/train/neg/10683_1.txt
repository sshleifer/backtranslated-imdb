An uncle is beaten. Right in sight, this other guy shoots at you. He has some bodyguards and they hit the killer, but a reporter is interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the boy who was beaten. She enters and corners a bodyguard, but he does not feel like talking. I can not understand why. It's not like someone else is interested. She is the only journalist there. Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this boring story. But hey, she does it anyway. She goes to see the sister and the murderer's mother. A few minutes after she leaves, they hit them big ... someone blows up their trailer ... a huge fireball. Then she looks for the hospital bodyguard. She finds him with a hangover in his boat, but a minute later both are sucking a dive tank underwater because three guys are trying to hit them (and they've blown the boat big, big fireball). The reporter and the bodyguard beat two of the guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> In the course of the next hour, another man is beaten across the street, there is a shooting with several things in a warehouse, some car chases with debris and death, a fake suicide, etc. Lotsa Rigidos, all kindsa butchery. <br /> <br /> Great things, but what the journalist and the bodyguard can not understand is: why the hell the original guy was hit. What is the motivation? Of course, you could help us figure out why the reporter is even interested. Through almost all of this, she is the only reporter in history. Nobody else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and corpses. It is true that the original boy who was hit was not exactly a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent. <br /> <br /> Is that the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no television cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers ... just another one of those police crimes ... <br /> <br /> So, what's the spoiler? Let me think ... <br /> <br /> No! I waited! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... the First Lady. She was accused because the president was fooling around. And she gets away with it. She is very sharp, huh? But how the hell could anyone realize that? Why would someone get upset? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this movement a "1". He was so stupid he just had to keep looking. And he just got more foolish! That is the real spoiler! But even if I told you, you have to see it to believe it!
