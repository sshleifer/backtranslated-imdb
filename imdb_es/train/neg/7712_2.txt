<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of the bad monsters movies that ends up being worse than the movies that it falsifies. The story (very sparse) talks about tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. Basically, they turn and snarl (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered in ketchup. The actors have no name and never made films after this, so it would not make sense to name them. There is a guy hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black boy who is the master of disguise and a girl and a boy who dives. Anyway, there is another woman who spies on the first man who works for the government. If this does not make much sense to you, you understand. This movie would never have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at the stupid attack scenes. The film is horribly cheerful, which, while it is the point, really hurts what could have been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. At one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on an undisclosed wooden board with wheels! Maybe I would have recommended the movie if I had had a nice camp value, but even this is not present in this terrible movie. 2/10
