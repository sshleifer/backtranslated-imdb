I am a big fan of the Italian films of the seventies, and I would not hesitate to include the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I entered this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a largely meaningless movie that will not go anywhere. Clearly, nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that it does not make sense becomes more annoying if we consider that it is also quite boring and that none of the characters is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; In this case one who steals, womanises and smuggles things. That's basically all the argument that this movie has. The film has a true 'seventies style' and the idea that everything is very carefree is transmitted well. Sometimes it seems that directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to expose some kind of point, although whatever that point is is not very well known. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; She is definitely the best of the movie and the sequence in which she hangs from a nude car is the best part of the movie. In general, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the style of the seventies, but unfortunately it does not have much more to offer.
