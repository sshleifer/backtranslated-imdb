This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "twin" connection feels something is wrong with her sister. This film took an eternity to establish the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The performance was terrible for the most part. Once the plot is united, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an abusive father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura is to blame for everything. It promises that girls will never separate, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a restaurant where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing good can come from this. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse to find him. I kept hoping that this movie would improve and that there would be some resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
