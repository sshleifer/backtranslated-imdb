Trying to compare or represent this "deception" as something "Hitchcockian" is an attempt to trick Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Acting weak Weak story Weak writing. <br /> <br /> Without real suspense, without emotions. You wait throughout the weakness of this movie for the great reward or even any reward ... You keep thinking, what the hell was all that. <br /> <br /> And please, just move to make "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the acting is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But those were much more innocent times ...
