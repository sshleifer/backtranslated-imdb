Comparing this misery with an old low-budget porn movie would be an insult to the old low-budget porn movie. The scenes of animals have no meaning or represent this man and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part, "picking up the recount of the terror reign of the BTK killer." This is NOT a recount. A recount would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I am an enthusiastic scholar of serial killers and I have seen some pretty bad movies about them and, honestly, this is NOT one of them. This is not even about the BTK killer. Save yourself some time and a few dollars and rent to Dahmer. That serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you simply MUST see this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then, you will still feel cheated.
