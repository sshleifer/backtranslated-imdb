This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She memorized each line, and delivered everything without a little natural emotion. She also has a more relaxed tone, and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This movie has WAY too Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, who took everything that was left of the film on his own.
