This is a dry and sterile film in one of the most interesting events of World War II and in the history of the war behind the front line. The bad composition of the drama is the worst of this film, since the plot about the assassination of Hitler supposes a quite dramatic event. There is no character development at all and the idea that Tom Cruise supposes he is a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I think Mr. Bin would play it better. In general, the film looks quite like a cheap copy of the good movie from the German television "Stauffenberg" of 2004, but can not approach that movie with respect to any aspect of the film at all. However, the film obviously achieves its financial goal with an audience of popcorn that appreciates Hollywood's quick-tempered blood and superficial artistic values.
