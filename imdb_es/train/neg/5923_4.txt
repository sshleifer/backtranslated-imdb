During the Civil War, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred "in the border states," where the north met the south by chance of geography. From the border, young father Owen Moore leaves to join the Union Army. In short, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, enters the property of the enemy, desperate for water; find a fountain where the young daughter of Unionist, Gladys Egan, sits. When the Yankee soldiers track him down, little Gladys innocently helps the Confederates to hide. Later, when he returns to kill his father, the kindness of the girl is remembered. A sweet and small story of the director D.W. Griffith. Images of location and humanity are lovingly displayed. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
