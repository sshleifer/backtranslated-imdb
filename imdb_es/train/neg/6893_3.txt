I had high hopes for this movie. The theatrical monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It is completely incredible that actors who are 34 years old are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers. The "language games" were horrible and exaggerated. Nothing about the movie seemed real to me. The ending was too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and I think I wasted an hour and a half of my life.
