If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is romantic, let her be a child. But prepare by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio. <br /> <br /> After having seen a film as good as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see again what happens in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but nobody seems to seriously work on the image of Indonesia in the entertainment world. That it is a 'global' world does not seem to arise in the minds of those who make films in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'Made in Indonesia' with a taste of the West, they get away with it. <br /> <br /> Okay, the story is nice. And it could have turned into a good movie. But, the director never thought about the fact that a musical needs, in the first place, live music Or, at least, a good reproduction and, in second place, a good choreography? In this film, the reproduction is SO BAD that makes you want to cry right there in the cinema. Every word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or who sings the playback, and is extremely annoying as you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they planned to make a film about morning gymnastics, but in the end it thought it would be good to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. They hardly dance anymore, jump here and there, throw their legs in the air, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there is a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a good candlelight dinner is much more romantic, DO IT!
