I did not know it was a silent movie with narration. I do not like silent movies: cheesy humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure that is attributed to the low score I assigned him. It was about chapter 8 before I found interest in this story and if I had eaten popcorn, I could have thrown it on the screen. Maybe this appeals to science fiction people? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this film, the only pleasant aspect of the film. No one stopped commenting on how much they enjoyed this or appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
