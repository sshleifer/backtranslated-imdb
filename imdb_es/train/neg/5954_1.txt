This show presents interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is announced as reality, but in reality it is pure telenovela in prime time. Try using exotic places as a facade to attract people to a fake contest and then hook up to the viewers with the style of the contestants' telenovela. <br /> <br /> It is also inspired by one of the first pioneering CBS games: Beat The Clock - inventing situations for its contestants to try and overcome. Then reward the winner. If you can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the format of the game is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock, the real achievement of this series is to escape from reality. <br /> <br /> This program has elements of several types of successful previous programs. Reality TV, hard, but if you're hooked with the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If not, this complete series is as I say, dripping with sauce. It's another show that hides behind the reality label, which is the trend that began in 2000. <br /> <br /> It's elegant and well produced, so it could last a while yet. After all, so do the reps of Gilligan Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. This simply does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is approximately the same.
