The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby urinating on the face of a nun. For this movie, that's ingenious. An unpleasant and malicious "comedy" is inept on so many levels that it engenders belief. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell, and congratulates him for maintaining his dignity in the onslaught that surrounds him with a note, annoying performances and puerile humor. And what the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Directed by Dennis Dugan and unpleasant in its attempts to activate sentimentality when it is done with rawness, the film is so poorly made that it is a rather strange experience. But it does not matter all that. The bottom line of all this is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unpleasant child actor I've seen on the screen? Believe me, you will want to hit him directly in the mouth.
