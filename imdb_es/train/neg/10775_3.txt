This movie is horrible! It competes with "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. I would have rated it lower than a 3, except for a couple of funny lines; But, in general, this movie was crap! It seemed that they had managed to spend a weekend somewhere bankrupt somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the fringes of management forever!
