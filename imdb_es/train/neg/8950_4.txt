A long time ago I heard about this novel, many of my friends recommended me to read it. I looked for it in each place and finally I found it. This is a book that every man should read, because he is a genius and because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and I could not wait to see it. When I finally did, I was very disappointed, many of the things that are in the book are not in the film (I do not think this is a spoiler) that only makes the film not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director. But a bad writer. Especially as a book adopter. The film is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is the performance. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I can see as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What most angers me are the people in IMDb who called "The best adaptation of the story" without even reading the book. ! Or know something about writing the screen! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brightness of the story by reading the book, do not consider this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this movie go for acting.
