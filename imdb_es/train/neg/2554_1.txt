Honestly, I'm not even kidding when I say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. This film does not have a single ounce of originality in its fragile dialogue or its blatantly plagiarized plot. I can not even begin to count the amount of things in this movie that, obviously, are spoiled by "The Omen" and other similar films. For example, the babysitter "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devil's henchmen sent to guide and protect Satan's spawn ... Does this sound very much like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else? Another thing is that in the orphanage where they first burned the child, a few months after their adoption, it was like "The Omen". However, fortunately, a priest survived the fire and escaped with severe burns throughout his body ... another coincidence? And to top it off, the burned priest stays in a hospital room with images of Jesus on all the walls, like the priest in "The Omen" who has pages of the Bible stuck to the walls like wallpaper. Please, do not even begin to make comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you because, as I said earlier, there are too many to mention here.
