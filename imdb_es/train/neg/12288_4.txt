Making the film as dark and fuzzy as possible to cover budget deficiencies is a strategy that is often used in low-budget horror films, but this is too far away. It is SO poorly lit and turbid (and it takes place almost at night, to boot) that you often end up almost looking at a black screen (although maybe the bad video transfer has also had something to do with that). Unfortunately, "cloudy" is also the best word to describe the plot of the film. The filmmakers throw ideas of horror different (and not original) without any appearance of logic, and in the middle of you feel that they have almost abandoned the effort to make a good horror movie; you know it when you see characters that are supposed to be in danger of death (or, sometimes, even that they are dead) making small talks ...
