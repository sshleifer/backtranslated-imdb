The lid of the box makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. The splashed college came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this movie stinks. The characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool There is no argument for this movie, who the hell would this movie waste? <br /> <br /> spoilers ahead <br /> <br /> the teacher dies in this, and it was a woman, we all know that we must have a woman survivor, if you are going to break the rules, do it with a good horror movie, not with this waste
