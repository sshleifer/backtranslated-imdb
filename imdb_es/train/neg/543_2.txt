Well, well, you can not waste your time for the sake of a big star. I think the only thing I can see is a lot of talents that waste time on a big screen with some pathetic humor that will attract me. I do not know to whom. Some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? Some pathetically abrupt turns justified by who? race against time? You mean waste against time? Okay, first you spoil your son, then you teach him a lesson, wow, we're so ignorant of this fact. Whoever said it is a new and bright concept, is probably another species that is not a human. Well, let me comment, as humans do. message that will be given, but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus instead of going to a film so useless to learn it. Hindi movies have already shown a lot and I can not waste my time writing about waste anyway!
