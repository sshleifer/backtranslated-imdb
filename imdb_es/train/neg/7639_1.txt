I saw this movie at the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in New York and I thought it was pretty bad. The first and most annoying was the way it was fired; that is, a lot of slow motion and too artistic approaches that seemed meaningless, from the point of view of history or aesthetically, apart from showing the skills of the director of photography (which I think was also the director). This movie looked like what a pretentious film student would think of. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very nice, but in the best case he was a mediocre actor; and the rest of the cast varied from regular to bad. The story itself was mostly annoying and predictable. I have to admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the movie; Laughing and sighing constantly, but it upset me a lot.
