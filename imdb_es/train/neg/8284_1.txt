Who wrote this? A guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first script he's worked on. Someone should have told you that you're supposed to write a dialogue that sounds like something someone could really say. <br /> <br /> And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut has fallen away from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let you know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you will not have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. I could also have wanted to let you know that I should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope I learned that lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... naturally, she can not act. Hell, it makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn and yet she's starring in this movie. Oh, wait, it was produced by your father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That is really the only reason I can think. <br /> <br /> So, should I be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be surprised how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw it as much as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as it is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did not pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes and could not continue. Without a doubt, I would have left before the theater. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw him for theater really stayed and watched everything. The movie starts ridiculously bad, and then it gets to the point of being so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese torture of water. And then, when the first act is over, you realize that it will only get worse, and that's when you have to go or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film falls into the category of being so bad, it should be used instead of the water boarding at Guant√°namo Bay. Although some prefer the aquatic approach.
