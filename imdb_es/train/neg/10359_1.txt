The series of books "Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite childhood series. I have read and reread them more times than I can count on in the last 35 years. The characters, with all their virtues and defects, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical and spiritual story that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed with this movie would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book (s), I imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a television movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the film:" I expected it to be bad, and it is. "<br /> <br /> I, like another critic here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.
