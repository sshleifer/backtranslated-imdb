This is a movie about how men think that women think about love. No woman describes a sexual encounter of one night and declares it a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues I felt, only three really had some kind of truth resonating through them. I kept waiting for the film to improve, and did it a little, but never enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I wanted it to be good, but it never succeeded. Maybe if they were really love stories it would have worked.
