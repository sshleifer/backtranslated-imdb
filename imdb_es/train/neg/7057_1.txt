This is one of the most irritating and pointless movies I've had the misfortune to sit on. Whenever it seems that it is getting good, more flashbacks appear in sepia tone, followed by paranoid idiocy disguised as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative and potential rebel who lives in a mansion apparently without any father or responsibility. The cast is much more friendly and interesting, but unfortunately it has never been developed. Nor do we really understand the character of John Stanton that supposedly influences Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought, "Aha, Maddox is just crazy and secretly inventing all those communications from the escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!" but, of course, that is not the case and the whole movie is useless, both from the perspective of Maddox and from the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
