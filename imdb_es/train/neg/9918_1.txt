Another banner of British cinema vacillates. The real garbage that is offered here once more. I can not understand (and I am British) why this patriotic nonsense was made so exaggerated. EIGHT years mark you, since when the Second World War was over! Other commentators here have commented on the apparently impeccable editing and use of archival material. This is extremely little observed. The archival images are in abundance. The model aircraft rotate from the cables in the "action scenes" like so many children's kites in the wind. The usual sequences of the map room tattoo the film so that we are supposedly trapped in the whole event of Malta. Guinness must have its worst performance in history. The shocking scenes of dog fights are laughable. Hawkins bores us all in the map room. Ealing made many great movies. This clearly is not one of them. They should have walked away from such unconvincing rot!
