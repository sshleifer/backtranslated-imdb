Do not get me wrong, this is a terrible movie, clich√©, but it's a treat for Olivia Hussey's fans, arguably the most intoxicating beauty in history. A poster said it was unpleasant to look at it. I wonder what his ideal woman would be like: Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster really should establish a subgenre for this type of movie, since the Fatal Attraction plot has become a genre in itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit quite well between the drama and action sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have killed his ex-wife, who looks a lot like Mrs. Hussey. This no-do-do-well proceeds to stalk Olivia and thus make her life hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I do not feel sympathy for the characters in the movies that cheat on their wives, so I really was not encouraging Olivia to come out with this stinking life. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There is a bit of violence in the film.) Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get involved in a fight when Denison says he will not stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she is too good in bed, Olivia can also handle a shooter and could squeeze a round - I'll let you see). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here.) She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - filmed at a distance. ). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (We've seen this plot before - a hundred times, and many times it gets much better.) The truth The culprit, in trying to decipher why this movie was a failure, is William Riead. The man's dialogue is sophisticated and stupid Man does not have the ability to tell stories and can not get away from it Several human reactions to the plot These people, from the upper strata of society, talk like high school kids, with the habit of sleeping during English class, I've placed Riead on the Never Again be seen list). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (The performance was not "telephoned" as the experts say, but was hampered A lot by Riead's youth script Olivia Hussey resorts to calling Anthony Jonh Denison "weird "and" crazy "on his face when he begins to stalk her.Hussey, who is still beautiful, offers the best performance here, but Denison was equal to The task of portraying an insane and maddened stalker.Don Murray was basically there (his character it did not materialize), and Edward Asner, an excellent actor when given something with substance, is misused in this film).
