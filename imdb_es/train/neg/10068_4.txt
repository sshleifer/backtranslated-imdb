A cowboy who sympathizes with the situation of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused of rape and murder of the chief's daughter, which generates much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This nudie feature is very fun to watch. Totally impossible to defend at any artistic level. The terrible disguises and the fact that all Indians are obviously white makes this look more like a caricature of real action than the serious production that your press material pretends to be. <br /> <br /> In short, abundant nudity (The real reason to see this) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both genders. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the famous Spahn Movie Ranch and presents not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder the moment he came to the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater!
