"Freddy's Dead" did the smart thing he could have done after the disappointment of the fifth movie. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie in the saga is silly, but at least it's original. Some of the images are even a little impressive. And the story of Freddy's boy (Lisa Zane) returning to the city to face his evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is just another caricature made to take children to the theater. It has a lot of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and roam like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and, in the end, it's just silly, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
