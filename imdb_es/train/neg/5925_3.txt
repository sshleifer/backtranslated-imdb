Is this the "worst" episode of Star Trek TOS? Maybe, at least my vote is in the bottom 5. I mean, this episode does not make any sense. Seeing something that drives you crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is increased, almost forced to increase the feeling of anguish, to the point that it stinks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, superior beings like Triskelion or anything other than Medusin, these are very boring aliens to make an episode. McCoy comes to pronounce his famous phrase "He is dead, Jim." Spock puts on his protective glasses when he transports the ambassador, but Kirk does not. They go through that damn "barrier" now for the third time I can remember, bored. At least the next episodes of the third season would be "Specter Of The Gun", and "Day of The Dove" and others that will follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where I would choose people like me as avid fans. In personal observations, Trek loved to use the purple color, his type of pinkish purple, as when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the walkway that is normally gray is now purple. We never had a purple bridge, but it is interesting to see it, I noticed it in several episodes, it was made by a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode, in the corridor of the boats it is quite scarce.
