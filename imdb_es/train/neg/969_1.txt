I was encouraging for this film, as it is a new version of the childhood television series "Escape into Night" of the 1970s, which, although chaotic and forced at times was definitely strange, fascinating and disturbing. The performance in "Paperhouse" is wooden, involuntarily a joke. The overdubs did not add tension, they only reinforced the fact that I was sitting looking at a mistake. Casting exasperated the lugubrious dialogue that resulted in relationships devoid of warmth, chemistry or conviction. As in most mediocre movies, there are some good acts of support that these people should comfort, console and ensure that they will not be responsible. Of all possible endings, the most unexpected was chosen ... slower than I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape into Night" deserves a suitable remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.
