I love horror movies that reveal a lot of mystery, like "silent bolt" (which I thought was pretty good, but still missing something) and movies that keep you guessing, I think this was one of those movies. At first, the movie starts with a good suspense and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls up the hill and from there it just goes faster and faster down. I mentioned silent hill at the beginning for a reason because I can see many of the themes "stolen" from that movie here .. In short, I would say that looking silent hill instead of this one, it's better, it's more scary, it has much more suspense and also the end is much better ... And best of all, you will not feel scammed like I did with this ... This seems to be one of those "I like that movie, so I'm going to do it in my own version really bad "kind of movie ... Oh, and one more thing ... Lordi ... in a horror movie ... that's like trying to scare a child with a careful bear that has" hug me and I'll love you for always "written in the stomach of that ..
