Here is one that you can see with a serious face, with a script so bad that even Will Ferrell would not be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. The Punch-Dance. Rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and, before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is sending a passionate and oversized bodyswerve to the bands of a band that would like to have the fake metal chops of Europe. <Br /> <br /> 2. John Farnham's are the voice In one of those epic sequences in which the star and his companions make The Slomo Walk on Main Street and the townspeople support them, the soundtrack is the gag . How did the filmmakers get to this Australian recording artist? An important Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who rose to fame in the early 70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so incredibly cheesy, it levels mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two high points in the film, both ruined anyway with sloppy writing, the rest of the movie is like choking on someone else's vomit. <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed cheater who has never taken a leap. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yes, someone really thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a jump under your starry belt, plan an extravaganza of 15 buses, which would surely kill a less bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider. to win the day and save his stepfather and, at the same time, eliminate cancer and whatever ... who sees these films by plot anyway? Along the way (as is usual in comedies), get a healthy chick (Isla Fisher), which surely must be delayed to consider exchanging chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost telephoned in her performance, then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
