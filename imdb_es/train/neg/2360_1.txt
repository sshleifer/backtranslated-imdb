This will be the most useless comment I have made, but I still have to warn you about the atrocity in the movies that is "Freddy's Dead". Not only is it the worst episode in the Nightmare series, it's the height of the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, meaningless, and almost death free. The horrible 3-D end and the deaths above CORNY's head are enough to take this "movie" to the ground. However, it does not stop there, it just adds bad acting, a terrible script and a series of corny cameos, and you already have this pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would also do it if it were like that. This is a movie strictly for fans only, do not look at our shame.
