Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel for the tube, however, this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and simply does not know when to give up. The struggling artist Meg Tilly is suddenly employed by the wealthy and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After hearing about the last meeting held there, the presentation party of Ellen's daughter, Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming that the daughter died mysteriously before the show began, nor that she and the deceased looked alike each ! Two magnificent actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn that does not support a close examination, one that fails to equal either of the two ladies in emotional intensity. The role of Burstyn falters in the camp, while Tilly is stuck doing the routine of dreamy eyes. Only one sequence at the end of the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is loaded with honest feelings, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
