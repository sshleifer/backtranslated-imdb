The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery at the end of the 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he intentionally punishes two of director Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies: the Arabs and the Germans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would have the freedom to roam and trap the blacks in West Africa is as credible as the whites who hunt slaves in "Roots". Obviously, both businesses are / were in charge of premises and involve (d) much more sophisticated networks. While the Arab countries are complicit in the current trade in children and slaves, Israel is one of the worst rapists according to Amnesty International. So why only point to the Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious the prejudice and hatred towards these people on the part of a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The performance is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
