Back to Cabin by the Lake is not, in any way, resistant to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequel, the movie is not even worth 2 hours of his time. I am a big fan of the first movie, the story and the acting were very good, but this is a movie that I will never see again. Basically it is equal to what the consequences of Urban Legends and Blair Witch were, but with a much worse performance. Personally I have seen better acting in soap operas, it is so unfortunate that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, seeing it will only detract from the first.
