I should never have seen this movie. The filming style can be considered artistic for some, but for me it is considered a migraine. I think it may have had an interesting plot, but since I could not see it for long periods of time, I lost a lot. The flashing images and the stop motion footage marked my brain. I stopped looking in the middle and will not be back for a second try. I guess if I was alone at home in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy night, this could be the ticket ... PS I'm not sure if the lighthouse / movie style can be considered a spoiler, but I do not want to be on the blacklist in my first review;)
