And I'm surprised how it came to production. The main character is an unpleasant spectacle that is not funny at all. I can not stand the character at all. He's an idiot with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst caricature on the surface in the last 10 years, no kidding. The lines of the story are poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as those of Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show anymore, it is terrible and it should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It's as if this program was written by a couple of 15-year-olds who relied on the character and think they are good things when they are really arrogant and lack creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
