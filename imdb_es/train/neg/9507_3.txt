I'm always frustrated by movies that were obviously written by a genre. Especially when, obviously, they do not investigate enough to discover when something not only does not sound true, but it sounds blatantly false. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that they got Diane pregnant. In no way, shape, or form, would a man ever encourage another man to make a girl pregnant in high school. They could encourage the boy to have sex with the animated cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first time the soccer team found out would not be in a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this movie did not do it. "It is not taken so seriously, and it was not horribly bad, but come on!
