As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, I have a different opinion about why the film was a failure. First, any comparison between novel and film is purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably intended as a satire, but instead, it is a cross between tragedy and controversy. Any comic element such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical drive. And do not let the author's ubiquitous white suit fool you into thinking that this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the spectrum of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is a clown and hack of equal parts, more famous than the author, and is always looking for a new grain for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is not surprising that the excellent production skills and the direction lavished in the making of the film were condemned from the beginning. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into a movie, the controversies are not based on universally accessible observations of some form or other of human behavior, but on a direct attack on specific people, whether they are real straw men or fictitious, they have Somehow earned the writer's anger. Any effort to create a successful story or narrative filmed from that beginning must have a clean start, free from the influence or interference of the writer. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I also find fault with the casting. It's not simply that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith are not up to the task, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are totally wasted or have roles that are mere cartoons. <br /> <br /> Here there is enough topic material for a great cinematic satire, but you can not even get close.
