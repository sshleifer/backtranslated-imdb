If you want an undemanding and reasonably fun hour, then it is good to see this. It's not so bad, really. Yes, it has more errors in the logic of what I would like to describe here and could test the patience of people, like me, I have to admit, who are willing to throw things on television at times, but at least it's fun . Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY fun, it's not necessary to be discouraged. <br /> <br /> However, if you have read the book, or any of Brookmyre's other books, then it is probably better to avoid it. I've read them all and the first time I saw this movie, I despised it. In fact, I have destroyed it in detail and extensively elsewhere. The plot of the television has practically no relevance with respect to the one of the book and only served to indignant and to enrage to many faithful (and, certainly, rabid) fanatics of Brookmyre. <br /> <br /> The best advice? Look at this, then read the book and only THEN make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
