This movie is for the history of the F.B.I. as Knott's Berry Farm is for the old west. Shamelessly disinfected version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation against crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other type?) Is shown along with high-quality script reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and 101 lighting. With Jimmy Stewart with 20% of his dramatic ability , Vera Miles chewing the stage, the film presents each c-lister known in the mid-fifties with hardly a touch of irony or humor, from the "Amazon rainforest" to the "backyard barbecue", everything sucks scenarios of sound and lots of background. Even the shots are canned and familiar. I imagine that Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting exteriors that establish shots, here nothing of note beyond a curiosity.
