The film remains in the gray for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, and as a result many strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but due to the way the stories are told, they only become strange and are not understandable to see. It forces you to watch the movie again, but I'm not going to do that in any way. I just saw this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I saw it at night I would have fallen asleep. For me, the movie was like the "Blade Runner" of a poor man. <br /> <br /> The movie leaves too many questions and improbabilities. It makes the film leave a useless impression and not lasting. <br /> <br /> Also, the strange appearance of the movie does not help much. The film is divided in half in CGI / in real life, but it has not been done in half as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as would be the case in later films like "Sin City" and "300". They even created half of the characters in the film by computer, which seemed a very useless and strange choice, also taking into account that the animation of the character is not too impressive. Surely the futuristic environment is still attractive and the film obviously was not cheap to make, but its style about substance and, in this case, it really is not something positive. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. The main god of the movie constantly says lines like; "I'm going to do this, but it's not your business why I want to do it." Do not say anything at all, Mr. Horus! It's annoying and something really easy to put on the movie, if you do not mind explaining something about the plot. In addition, the deepest questions and meanings of the film are confused with the nonsense of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors still did everything possible. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from original. It is a scam of many classic and semi-classical films, mostly modern, science fiction. Maybe that's also the reason why the movie made a great impression on me. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
