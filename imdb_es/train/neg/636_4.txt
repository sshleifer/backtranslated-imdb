A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small town in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the lead roles, speaking with false accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and lands are the best things for men. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, great scenarios are created and special effects are produced, movie makers can not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent again. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It seems that Franklin did not know when to finish the painting. This movie could be dangerous if it is taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
