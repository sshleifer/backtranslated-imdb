['If there was ever a movie that deserved a great grade of zero, it&#39;s this pile of garbage. I love zombie movies and even bad ones have something in their favor, but not this atrocity. In fact, I started to feel angry at seeing this movie because it is so insultingly poor that I can not believe that the responsible people think that this is acceptable. <br /><br /> There is no plot and the plot is cut with scenes of sadism and whipping. People do not react, act or in any way resemble human beings. The entire film was also filmed in two rooms with poor decoration to look vaguely like the places where they are supposed to be. All this is a senseless disaster, it is not going anywhere and when the zombies finally appear, they look like garbage and do not do much. <br /><br /> I could make a better movie than this, you could also and someone who had never seen a movie before. It is unfortunate and without a doubt the worst movie of all time. <br /><br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice for sure that the only positive reviews give this one 10/10 and they urge you to BUY the DVD. I can not imagine someone neutral who really thinks that this is a good movie, it is terrible. <br /><br /> 0/10 and that&#39;s generous.']
