Having loved 'Paris, Je T'aime', I anticipated this film a lot and I admit that I entered with many expectations, but I was deeply disappointed for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect a new version of 'Paris' in New York I expected the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was the rupture of the neighborhoods. You have an idea of ​​each director's style and the story they wanted to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear separation of stories, in different points of the film, the characters of different stories are among each other, which made me confuse who was watching and what was happening exactly. In addition, the change in direction was evident, but confusing since there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I loved about the movie 'Paris' was the different love shot. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman who longed for love, etc., exploring so many layers of the complexity of love among humans. 'NY' seemed to go only for an avant-garde and exaggerated sexuality. There were some exchangeable shorts (the older couple had spent their whole lives together, Julie Christie's short), but in general, the movie "NY" did not provoke any emotion. I did not connect with any of the characters as I did with 'Paris'. I remember seeing 'Paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, wonder ... I just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie 'NY'. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had entered it without having 'Paris' in the back of my brain as a comparison, this movie could have triggered a more favorable response, but as a self-titled version of' Paris, Je T'aime 'I was deeply disappointed.
