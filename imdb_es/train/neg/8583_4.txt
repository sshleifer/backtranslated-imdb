Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast. <br /> <br /> I discovered an exciting fact about this movie: someone! You have to paint high voltage poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they would really like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I got bored watching nocturnal infomercials and decided to really watch this movie, I found the characters interesting and highly attractive. <br /> <br /> I do not usually watch a lot of television late at night, so I can not recommend this movie, unless you see the painting dry it is your idea of ​​two exciting hours out of your life
