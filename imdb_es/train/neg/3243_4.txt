By far the most important requirement for any film that follows trickers of trust is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to catch one of us, as well as their fools, the cops, the mafia and (ideally) between yes. . But this movie NEVER gets this out. You can see every scam that comes a mile away (especially from the big ones!) They are also not very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate this with an agile dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, it failed. The lines are fine, but they were delivered in a stylized, unnatural and stylized way that I thought that maybe some intelligent comment was made about all of us acting all the time ... but it was not like that. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a bit repressed and makes some Freudian slips ridiculously forced about his father thinking he is a whore, but she overcomes him. Although I really liked the street scenes. It looked like a painting by Edward Hopper.
