"Major Payne" is a film about a grown-up who makes life hell for his small group of children in the navy. This movie really does not have much to offer, but it offers several fun moments that are worth seeing. However, do not expect it to be a memorable movie. Just wait to laugh your way through the movie and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Commander Payne and the plump boy was very funny, and that's all I remember about the movie, except for the guys who want revenge on Commander Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably better to see it on a rainy day when you need to laugh.
