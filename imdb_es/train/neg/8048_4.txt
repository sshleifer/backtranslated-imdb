Suppose you've been on a desert island for the last ten years. I have not heard of Scream and left when the first part of Halloween went into the cinema. So, this movie would have been a marvel and a completely new vision in the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At this moment, there is a rating of 2.7 on IMDb and it does not deserve such a low rating. Cutting it all the way, like "I know what you did," and who that is, when it came to the end, it convinced me of who and why. <br /> <br /> It's not a big surprise, just a good movie to watch with a cola, popcorn and not wanting to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If the rental of the video is outside the main titles, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I have seen much worse.
