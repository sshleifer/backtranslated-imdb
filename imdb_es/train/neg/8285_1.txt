This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Jessica Simpson not only lacks the ability to act, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. In fact, you hear a serious dialogue that says: "I love you more." "No I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could not take it anymore. His "southern girl charm" simply does not work and is really annoying; her attempts for slapstick humor fall and she delivers lines as if she were reading the script just after leaving the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not read the script before agreeing to do this, or fell in love with the promise of big profits from Papa Joe (Jessica's father and also the producer of the film)? Hopefully now you know that it is better not to sign another movie like this one. Luke Wilson is really a good actor. I hate to see the expression of pain on his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably involved in the movie in some way or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their right mind would really find this movie attractive. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy some acting lessons?
