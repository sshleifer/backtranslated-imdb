"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolute horrible scam of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman who is admitted and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (More or less the same structure of the story of La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in the history of cinema. The "acting" of Lamas is simply a bad personification of Steven Segal. Seeing Orenthal perform in this film is an unbearable experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting are so bad in this movie that sometimes it's ridiculous. There are so many "conventions" of action movies in the movie that it's ridiculous: unnecessary explosions of cars, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The musical score is similar to David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which promotes the Steven Segal theme of this film. There's a lot of martial arts in the movie, and it's pretty good for a low-budget US production. The action without sense and on the superior performance never ceases, and I must admit that I entertained myself a little. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star in the early 90s, but he's certainly not an action star, that's why he's doing soap operas and not great action hits. My recommendation is to omit "CIA Name: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita" instead.
