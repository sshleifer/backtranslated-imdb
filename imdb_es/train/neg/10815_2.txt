I love the book "Jane Eyre" and I've seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and failures. However, this was one of the worst I've seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly seemed the flat part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if that were possible. How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not get my attention. Maybe the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton's version (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version (which It is NOT so faithful to the book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
