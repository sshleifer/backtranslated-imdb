This is a confusing and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. That's not an exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to get involved. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why the Erwin / Elvira suicides end, but instead of this, in each scene someone tries to explain: "when I was young, this happened .. . "and" he just returned from Casablanca and ordered him to cut everything there ... ", etc. <br /> <br /> Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse talking to a prostitute friend (no doubt, a slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant chat), and while telling him the story of life of Elvira. , Fassbinder shows the slaughter of one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course, we come to the very coarse and coarse symbolism of "I have suffered a lot in my life and I am about to die". <br /> <br /> In one of the few moments when something really happens, Erwin / Elvira. He meets an old lover, who only after performing an extremely gay choreography with two other types (as if it were the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (as when the nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything in the film is wasted due to Fassbinder's self-indulgence.
