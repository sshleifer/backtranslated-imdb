The shame of the films of Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and offer a constant gut rate in this piece of cinematic garbage that does not even cost You Tube standards. I gritted my teeth throughout the film from beginning to end with the schizophrenic direction, a plot that never materialized and in the last scene I felt ashamed that my country and its creators of crorepati films can "cry" for so much stupidity. It is a pity for the actors to take this job and even comment on it as part of the work they may have. Saif Ali Khan: completely disappointed with his movie choice. Kareen shows enough skin for the affected puberty and Akshay appears as the imbecile. Anil another delayed with a pubescent fascination for English. His cronies were praiseworthy in their performance and with the strange cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to burst a blood vessel. DO NOT LOSE any brain cells, energy or your money to go see this. Go see / rent AMU, with Konkana Sensharma in place, a beautiful piece of independent film that has always left India. Intelligent, moving and a wonderful story. That will affect everyone with intelligent actors and gave me the hope that not everything is lost in Indian cinema.
