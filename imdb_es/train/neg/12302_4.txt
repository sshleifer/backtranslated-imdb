A co-production between Italy and the United States co-stars Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how could a horror fan struggle to resist such a deal? <br /> <br /> Well, based on the uneventful, extremely tedious, and absolutely meaningless, during the first forty minutes or so, I would have said 'very easily'; Fortunately, however, things get a little more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find a copy without cuts, also a bit of nudity (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to eliminate that offensive material). <br /> <br /> Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island to take pictures of his latest project, a book about witches; While there, the frustrated Gary also hopes to try to cure a bad case of blue balls by freeing Leslie from her virginity. <br /> <br /> His plans for nookie are frustrated, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), his pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), his son Tommy (Michael Manchester), the beautiful nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who came to inspect the hotel on the island. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, the new owners of the property welcome Gary and Leslie, and when a violent storm suddenly increases, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, all Accept spending the night in the old building. Unfortunately, without the knowledge of the new hotel guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human sacrifices to return to life. One by one, the victims are dragged into a swirling red vortex (which guarantees an involuntary laugh), before facing a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (Manchester Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best performers, which says a lot about others), but the spectators who overcome the sad first part are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by witches and impaled on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins throb and explode in blood geysers; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair is possessed (again).
