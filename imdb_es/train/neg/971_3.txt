This is my first time so naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, it would eliminate the horror of the genre, since it is by no means horrible or frightening in the least (with the exception of some weak attempts of unfortunately, one of which worked with me. that calling this film a thriller is pushing it, since it did not excite me too much! The film is about a spoiled naughty girl who faints several times During these moments, she visits a house she has been drawing, after each visit she decides adding something more to the house to make it a little more lively one of the characteristics of being a sad child who is also really sick When she befriends the child, she realizes that her imaginary world that she created is really better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her father to the house, due to a mistake, her father turns out to be evil and she and the child must escape from her clutches. <br /> <br /> Think that it is an attempt of s It's a slightly softer version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10 will hope that at least one of you will not see this monotonous!
