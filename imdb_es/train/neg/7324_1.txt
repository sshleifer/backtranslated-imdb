As a graduate in film studies, I would like to think that I have seen a variety of films, some good and some bad, but I must say that 'Summer Rain' is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I chose the film with the hope that it was a great British classic like 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but oh no, this was so bad that my flatmates and I ended up laughing and shrugging at the ridiculous performance. and cheesy script (it reminded me of a bad school production of 'theater in education'). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to bother us from the beginning. "Michelle", the protagonist who lives with her two friends, has the kind of face you would never tire of slapping and Gary was so wet (broke into tears every 5 minutes) that at the end of the movie they really did not care about anything of none of them. All I could think was "I paid Â£ 3 for this stack". I have never written a review before, but after watching this movie, I was encouraged to warn people of this disastrous production. So please, avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
