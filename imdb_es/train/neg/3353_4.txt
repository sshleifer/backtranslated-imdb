The rather bad movie does not offer anything new. The usual cries and moans try to make up for a confusing but thin story. The acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed for this is an assumption of either. Owen Wilson really becomes one of the worst performances in the recent history of horror films. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and not much more, although Lili Tayor did an above average job. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was stunning and fascinatingly beautiful. However, they can not compensate for the bad performance and the story that seems to have been released at the last minute. Do not bother yourself
