All these critics are successful. I have seen many bad movies over the years, believe me, and this is much better than that! <br /> <br /> This is not just a waste of time "so bad is good" for the exploiter, but an authentic, hilarious, atrocious movie. <br /> <br /> Check out the white furry monster of the monster type! <br /> <br /> FOLLOW R√çO in the performance of Thom Christopher "spell spell". <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! in the frayed sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people who participate in 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' are not really aware that they are appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and lack of sleep. I had to trace a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really so horrible. It is. Worse still than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all John Derek's films, this is, in truth, the Citizen Kane of Trash.
