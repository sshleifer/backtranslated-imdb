I was excited to see a comedy that, hopefully, would represent the Candians Indians, but I found that this program was not fun at all. The producers and the cast are probably happy to receive positive and negative comments because, as far as they are concerned, they are talked about! I was prepared for some stereotypes and I do not have problems because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are generally true. But there really was not anything funny about these stereotyped characters. The dad "fresh from the boat", who does not understand his daughter. The radical Muslim feminist (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the young modern Indian who tries to run his mosque with the greatest possible policy (he is a pretty good actor, I only see him improve). /> <br /> It is very artificial and the dialogue does not flow so well. There was a lot of potential for something like this, but unfortunately I think it failed, and I really do not mind watching another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she always a taste and something natural in everything she does, what a pity that her daughter in the program does not have the same skills of acting!
