Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have won $ 1 trillion from the lie of global warming! Like all the other fables made by man in the world, this is one of the best lies that have swallowed so many people. Sure, pollution is not a good thing, and I would love for all trees to continue to grow, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people who are all very deceitful. <br /> <br /> Google! There are many things that simply do not add up, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but you kept making a lot of money sucking in the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Santa is real?
