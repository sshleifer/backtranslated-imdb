I made the big mistake of really seeing this whole movie a few nights ago. God I am still trying to recover. This movie does not even deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb must have ratings of 0 possible votes for movies that really deserve it like this. A 1.4 is TOO HIGH. <br /> <br /> I had heard how horrible this movie was, but I really did not believe that a movie could be so bad, especially in this day and time. I thought that all the dreadful movies of corny gods were only from the fifties and sixties. My God was wrong. Trust me, friends, this movie is really the bad thing. It is beyond the horrible; it is beyond pathetic; It is beyond any kind of word I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the Best Movie of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now was the worst movie I've seen) seems to deserve a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I can not believe that the creators of this movie thought This was a legitimate and serious effort to produce a Hollywood movie. This does not have to be called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought I was watching a high school theater class trying to make a short movie. Or better yet, I thought it was a live Saturday night play. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is horrible; The whole movie looks like it was filmed with a 20 year old VHS video camera. the special effects ... well, well, Mr. Bewitched from before had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he gets shot at the door is more than ridiculous and more corny. I mean seriously, my introduction to acting class 4 years ago in college, we could all have put together a better movie than this one. And the worst part of the whole movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh, my God, I almost got up. I have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. Some people should never be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this movie seems to go nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear again; Arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is that he has a pornography shop. Everything about the movie is just horrible. <br /> <br /> This really does not have much to do with my criticism, but for everyone to know, I am not a gay man. However, I do support the rights of homosexuals and I think we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. (WHERE IS THE F * (# * ing white out?) Hahaha But I did not want anyone to think that I hated this movie just because it was about two gay guys It has nothing to do with it: this would have been so horrible of a movie if it was Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say, and yes, it was even worse than Lei. warning for everyone: ONLY watch this movie if you just want to sit down and laugh at how pathetic some movies can still be in the 21st century. If you watch this movie and you're really expecting a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you at all. <br /> <br /> In a final thought: How in the world are there 7 movies classified DOWN in this IMDb? There is no way that there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this!
