"The Rainmaker", released in 1956, has some of the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Even they can not keep this completely about the melodrama performed. First, Hepburn is terribly misinformed as a shy old maid, despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can achieve it. She is too strong to be credible as a simpleton, and she was too old for the role. Lancaster acts extremely, and Earl Holliman is too bad and looks more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the always reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise a little above the cast, but even they can only do so much. It seems that the 1950s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress, and that's fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she did not do many of them. Despite a cast of A list and good production values, it does not work.
