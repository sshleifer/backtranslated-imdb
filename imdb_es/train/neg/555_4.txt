The movie is quite confusing and ridiculous. The plot is horrible ... but on the positive side, the acting is pretty good, with some good shouting and comments. Sharon Stone is fine this time ... not even half as good as the original. The murders are not as bloody as the first, which is a shame. However, it is not the unpredictable mess that everyone says it is. Sex is pretty graphic at times, while others are clearly false (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with jokes and discussions between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot twists a couple of times, but the end is horrible. The tension is always constant with a lot of "Oh my God!" The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and the shots and angles of the camera are impressive and add a bit of class to a film that is otherwise felt. Sharon Stone is a bit old for this too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first, delights. This time, they are too horrible to describe. The movie itself is quite normal, but it's worth a try. Mainly because the movie deserves a good buzz ... with the opening sequence as a highlight. It's not critical, but if you liked the first one, leave this one. Do not ruin the race. You'll be glad you left this stone unturned.
