This was a horrible movie. Basically, Jane March was a half Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to US forces in South Korea. She becomes a servant of a US military family, all consider her Korean, although she looks whiter (I think the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 of Southeast Asia, not entirely Korean), and the teenager Of the house He begins to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way in which Korea and the US military are represented in Korea is completely unhealthy. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who had never spent a day in Korea before this film and had no intention of showing a real vision of life in Korea, whether it's for Koreans or US GIs, and in their place only tried to fulfill their pathetic fantasies of Asiaphile without taking into account how amazing the film was. Anyone who has been to Korea will know that this is absolute rubbish. In the end, the honhyol spy girl from North Korea is killed, in an obvious way to "pay for her sins". Very bad movie with a television sensation.
