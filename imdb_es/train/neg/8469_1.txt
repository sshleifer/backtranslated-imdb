"Kids Like These" could have been a decent movie, given the subject. But, instead, it has become a television movie of the week, below the average, which does not have much to offer. The performance is obsolete, the plot predictable and the address non-existent. For a better film on the same subject, try the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a film that really cares about people with Down syndrome. In "Children like these", they are simply used as an excuse for sentimentality. Pretty scary. 1/10
