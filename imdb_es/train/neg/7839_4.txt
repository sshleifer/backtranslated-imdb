Serge Farnel made a very accurate critique of this film in the magazine "The Rwandese night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> A criticism that shows how France was behind the whole situation experienced by the United Nations in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while the French soldiers received a warm welcome from the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by genocide forces. <br /> <br /> That's why UN soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind French trucks. <br /> <br /> In doing so, they gave up the Tutsi, which is unforgivable. Of course. <br /> <br /> But we must bear in mind that the French soldiers organized this situation.
