Pretty good movie, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder and was never declared innocent. The state of New Jersey simply did not do it for the third time, since 20 years had passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass a test of lies and go free." He did not take it. This movie should never have been made, but money talks. Many people have unjustly passed their lives in prison and, no doubt, more blacks than whites. Why choose a false story? <br /> <br /> Jens
