Along with the films of the 70s and 80s, those of the undead were probably the second most popular subgenre of terror. While Slasher's films had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' for everything to work, the zombie movies had George Romero's 'Dead' movies. And, as expected, shortly after the success of their first two in the series, other directors wanted to take advantage. Many Italian directors were especially interested, like Lucio Fulci, who took us 'Zombie' one year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'. , known as 'Zombie' in Italy and other countries, and it was there that Fulci's film was known as 'Zombie 2'. Apart from the undead, it has no relation to the Romero movie, but it is a good movie in its own right. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born. <br /> <br /> Advantages: Many beautiful and exuberant landscapes. Impressive score The performance is not exactly good, but the cast is a game and seems to be enjoying the experience. After a slow start, the rhythm moves like an action movie. Great amount of cheese and involuntary hilarity for lovers of bad movies. Good work on makeup effects. Lots of blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Cons: Practically trace less. Nothing you have not seen before. Flagrantly steals some things from the first films of 'Return of the Living Dead'. Cardboard characters He has not aged too well due to the bad rock music of the 80s (not that he is saying that all the rock music of that period is bad), the clothes and the general feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I do not know if he ever intended to take back what that movie left. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during the production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are pretty ridiculous, but like this movie, many are very funny. And that's all this movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (rating of "What is bad, good") 2/5 (Gravity rating)
