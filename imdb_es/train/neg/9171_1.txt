What can I say? I ignored the comments and went to see it myself. Damn the reviews were so correct. What a waste of money considering your budget. <br /> <br /> Good thing, I went to see Kill Bill after this one. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, it would be Crossroads! <Br /> <br /> Bottom line: I like more "Girl in Gold Boots" than this shit.
