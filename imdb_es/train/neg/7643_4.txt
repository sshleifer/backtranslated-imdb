Once a big action star that fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and the dead body of a federal agent. Meet with some former castmates to clean the city. <br /> <br /> Key, often to the point of foolishness, the "action" comedy mostly just does not work. Part of the problem is the casting of Chris Klien as an ex-action hero. He is not bad, but in reality he is not credible as someone who was considered a tough guy. Like I said it's not bad, it's just a mistake so it's your back story. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is not really funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction that is pedestrian towards the port of boredom. There is no life in the way things are created. It's as if the director had a list of shots and followed it. He does it for a movie without commitment. And yet, the film occasionally comes to life, like the one shown in the final presentation that ends the movie. That sequence works, but because the previous parts of the film failed, much of its power was exhausted. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend the movie. It is worth trying if you are a fan of the actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
