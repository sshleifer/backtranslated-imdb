Congratulations to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room every day to see Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today, apart from classic movie buffs, know something about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won the previous year against Louis Pasteur. My opinion is that, although it tended to exaggerate a bit, I still believe that it was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Whatever the party that played; you stayed on the screen watching it. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought that this story smelled too much of what we've seen in the past 60 years: go further to make a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not repress its disdain for the police or the military, so it is a point to tell us how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers love when authority is challenged and defeated. In that sense, this film is far ahead of its day, as we have seen this great moment since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it must be borne in mind that the facts support this story. Nor does it diminish in any way the achievements of Zola as a social reformer, by getting rid of certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time demonstrating that, than concentrating on a test.
