I do not know why, but after all the hype on NPR, I thought this was a new movie ... all the best footage has been used for BBC documents and NatGeo projects that you've seen if you're interested in programs nature. ... has been repackaged with a sarcastic narrative and dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day; there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, ... ......... James Earl Jones speaks, but he expected an innovative film, taking into account the new technology of camera used in the making of this film ... has been cleaned up for a children's audience, so one can really see better images for free on YouTube ... I think we are prepared for something as innovative as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and This movie is certainly not.
