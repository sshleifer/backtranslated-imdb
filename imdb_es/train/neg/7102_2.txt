Okay, I admit I saw this movie in Mystery Science Theater 3000 (of which I'm a big fan), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give an MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some of the worst I've seen, I've been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That said, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. (It's not surprising, in fact, that the same MST3K writers commented that this was one of the worst, do not you believe me? Visit their site.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is A good example of what NOT to do in the cinema. The dialogue is very bad, the performance is worse, the cinematography is pathetic, the direction (although perhaps the best of this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is the worst part of this movie. Sometimes in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. While minutes do not sound like a very long amount of time, they can be in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was very bored. I really felt like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspension of disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie," then this has a lot of that. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is so horrible, there's no way I could even get interested in something that was really happening in the movie, and therefore, the "suspension of disbelief" did not really exist. <br /> <br /> One of the worst, and probably the most boring movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
