Oh dear, this movie was bad for several reasons. I was expecting to see a very low score for this movie and I was a bit surprised at the overall score. I'm sorry, but to qualify this as many have done, it's a joke! Once you get over the trick of the one-shot / black-and-white movie, which was a good idea, the film is prolonged, even at a run time of only 66 minutes. The sequence of credits at the beginning was also very annoying! In the truck, the guys suffer a puncture and change the wheel, wow, that's what was needed in the story! How slow were the boys chasing and actually succeeding in hurting Campbell? It seems that they did not bother to continue chasing it ... I sigh ... I am very happy to have got it for free with a special edition of Evil Dead!
