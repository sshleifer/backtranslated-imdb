One would think that a movie about the fact that a young man comes to terms with his growing homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production must be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is approximately ten times more powerful than any other sleep aid in the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * considered * making a film, but he became lazy and decided instead to run a series of random images (and BORING randomly) and scenes of going nowhere, throwing a couple of real scenes with the Real acting, simulating that good lighting is not important in the filming process, and wrapping it under the auspices of an "artillery" movie. This is exactly a type of shitty product that makes it easy for many traditional filmmakers to poop on the independent film movement, and that prevents the general public from more easily accepting independent films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films that cover this topic, you would be much better tuning in to some of the great short films available on the Logo website or by renting Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this piece of long-winded rope.
