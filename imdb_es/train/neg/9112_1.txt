Basically, cruel intentions 2 are cruel intentions 1, again, only badly made. The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and taking me to see it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core pornography. I'm not sure if I blame the actors or writers for some of the idiotic lines ... and I always feel bad about saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a double. waste time of my life. Literally, I'm surprised that some films are made, and this is no exception ... I can not believe they made a third.
