I have been an environmentalist for years and I really wanted to see this show. I had it ready to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn some new and great things. Probably could if I could beat Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of this is ready to look like a reality show and attract that kind of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This program should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Given that Ed is such a good source of information, Maybe a second show that is really serious about the environment would be a good idea. It is not necessary to calm things down for some of us. <br /> <br /> I no longer record episodes or watch the program, but they do let me know if a real green show can be in the works.
