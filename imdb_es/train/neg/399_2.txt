This image started with good intentions, Bacon, the scientist who tried the theory of invisibility, and Shue is beautiful as always in his role. Everything collapses after that, now it's your typical Hollywood thriller, filmed in a sound studio with abundant special effects, without any kind of humor, wit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get the audio tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
