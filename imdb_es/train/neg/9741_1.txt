(Spoilers) The only really memorable part of this British kitchen, otherwise quite boring and lukewarm, is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dyeing jobs of all time. That, and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil guy who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a boring gray movie funny. I particularly like when Crow kills Mike with his 'death touch', and when he revives him in the theater, Mike shouts "Boys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! Oh, it's this movie ..." That would be a disappointment, having to return from the afterlife to see the rest of The Projected Man. The movie could make a fortune sell as a sleep aid. Some of the puns in the movie were perverse: police inspector: "electrocution!" Raven "shocking, is not it?" police inspector: "That's a lot, it's okay" Tom Servo "Very low, right next to the floor!" Police inspector- "Can I continue?" Tom Servo- "He's dead, but let him go" MST3K is definitely the only way to see this snoozer.
