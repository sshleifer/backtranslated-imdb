Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world come to earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life, another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the savior of a whole race <br /> <br /> So, how could we call this killing machine? It's almost as if it were a kind of destroyer or eradicator ... something like an exterminator or something like that. What is the word I'm looking for ... something that ends things? Hmmmm ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the protector (who quickly strips off the white robe that stole Luke Skywalker in favor of the local clothes) finds the girl first and imbues her with a hero born in the future to be. The evil uhhhh ... "exterminator" kills some hustlers and steals their weapons and clothes, then tries to locate the woman by visiting her place of work and looking around, looking menacingly into people's eyes and repeating her name in a threatening way . <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race to survive while the seemingly immortal and unstoppable "exterminator" pursues the couple across the field. At some point you can buy boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in an exciting final, you will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge, full tank truck. .. acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be saved ... but no! Then it will emerge again, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and chase the girl in a meatpacking plant, where in a terrifying finale, he is pushed into a large piece of industrial machinery to chop, and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I'm extrapolating too much ... after all, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her in a bar, then tells him that the boy will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved the first time I saw them in Star Trek: Next Generation too! Sean Young makes another great twist as a non-emotional Replicant, and career sweat Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Boyfriend. However, I'm not sure where it fits into the plot ... maybe it's an import from a different James Cameron movie?
