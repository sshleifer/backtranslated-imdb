['I rented this movie thinking it was the sad 1959 version I saw when I was a kid. Was not. Therefore, I was very disappointed with what I felt as a marginal performance, a poor development of the character and, above all, the fact of not having highlighted the relationship between the child and his dog. In this version ... the &quot;Flanders Dog&quot; is just a nice &quot;apart&quot; from the movie. Get the 1959 version!']
