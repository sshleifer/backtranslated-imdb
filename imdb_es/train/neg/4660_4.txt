At first glance, this gives the impression that it will be a ridiculous blaxploitation movie, and contains moments in which it deviates in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than might be expected, and it is a respectable effort to portray the racial problems in the army of the Second World War era. The recognizable cast is unpredictable, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underrated Billy Dee Williams performing better. Stephen Boyd, however, stops shortly before turning his thick mustache in a too indulgent star turn. <br /> <br /> The obviously low budget leads to an inconsistency in production values. The locations are great, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" would have consisted of half the squad being killed in exactly the same way that Vin Diesel's Caparzo had done (except that we can see the shot because the effects can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and fired five Germans for the climax. However, the outcome, with the heroic soldiers who receive no respect for their achievement because they are black, and that the racist Captain of Boyd is being effected by this, is convincing, as are the script sequences of the Turman character in a diary of his imaginary feats if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In summary, "Black Brigade / Army of Carter" is not very successful. But it's a respectable failure, it's not a bad joke. It could be remade as a very good film and, in its current form, it is an interesting effort.
