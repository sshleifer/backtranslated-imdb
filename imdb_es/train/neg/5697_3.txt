This is the most elementary type of ghost story, not even animated to a large extent by the use of Irish places. If the great Mr. R. James had ever had such a thin story, does not James actually have a story called "A Thin Ghost"? - He would not have bothered to publish it. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears in the inert extremes as a favor for a couple of old friends, the producers of this film. His presence and the only joke in the film industry would have earned him the will of his Oscar nomination. This is one more piece of evidence, if needed, that the Academy Awards have never been a guarantee of merit.
