The script of this Columbo movie seemed to have been taken from a soap opera of the eighties. The films deeply driven by the characters are excellent, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this movie, the only convincing was my desire to change the channel. The villain's dialogue sounds as if it were written by a romantic novelist. The great lieutenant Columbo is not close to his famous, kind, modest and wrinkled self; and the victim of girlfriend / kidnapping is a damsel in distress who groans unidimensional (she cringes with fear with a small scalpel that she has weakly in her abductor's hand - come on! I could have pulled the scalpel out of her hand and kicked her where you know in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character should, at least, TRY to fight or defend himself at least a little. And speaking of reality ... the story revolves around a kidnapping that is solved and solved by the police. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes care of all kidnapping cases. This was NO Columbo, just a superficial and totally predictable criminal drama with our familiar lieutenant Columbo written and extended to 2 hours.
