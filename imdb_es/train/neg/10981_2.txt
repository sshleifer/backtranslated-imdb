Or listen, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I've seen (that would be about Billy), but it's very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is inanimate, in the hands of a good writer it could have worked. . . It certainly could have been much more entertaining. There is not a single point in the plot that you can not see along ten miles down the road. The dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to the injury, it is full of one-dimensional and stereotyped gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two protagonists was possible, and much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact, there is no evidence of why leaders love each other. . . They only tell us that they are in love. It is difficult to understand when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do you like the same book? Hey? <br /> <br /> The performance is not totally bad, but the pace is extremely slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch, slow, but without the quality of Jarmusch. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this one.
