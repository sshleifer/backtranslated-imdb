It's a pity that even a talented director, Desplechin, can not muster a decent performance from an actress with a grim talent, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a clear and concise argument. In an attempt to comply with the concentric circle of the difficult situation of an actor, performance and presentation are too designed and poorly executed to attract the compassion of the viewer. In a too long execution time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the story in a fragile framework of a disastrous screen. The content is incoherent and free when Phoenix strives to carry out Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is supposed to be trying to do the same. Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never felt a victory in Phoenix's talent.
