I love all Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested in seeing a movie made after one of his books. I knew there would be no way for the film to capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the content of the book, and seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than on anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot in the film, I think you could definitely have chosen better actors to play the characters. The only actors in the film that I thought played their roles, which fit Robbins' descriptions in the book, were Julian's friends, in his five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. Those who have not read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.
