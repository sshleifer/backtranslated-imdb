Pity, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director did not manage to put this together. There is a lot of action, a lot of promise, but everything goes wrong. The director did not do his job. The promising action comes from lame. So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV credits it as 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job.
