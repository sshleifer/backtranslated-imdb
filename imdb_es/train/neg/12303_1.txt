This movie is so bad that it's good, in an unintentionally funny way. I could not stop seeing it, I was laughing a lot! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the wife of an oppressed preacher who falls in love with Luke (Corey Sevier), a vagabond and mysterious vagabond who finally discovered that he was in prison; However, the only thing Sevier is guilty of is acting badly. Of course, it is not worse than the other actors. You have the feeling that the actors do not have the slightest idea that they are in a really horrible movie; They are playing it directly. Everything about the film is bad: the performance, the script, the scenes of love, the rhythm, the twists of the plot, the choice of music. The climatic scenes are so ridiculous: first the shooting in the church, then Luke's last words to Emily, I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Luke did a lot of lifting weights and sit-ups in jail, and we can see a lot of his naked torso. That is probably the highlight of the movie.
