Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children's story, La Bete (1975), alias The Beast, tries to imagine (in a very graphic way and what may seem offensive and disturbing, but in reality it is a rather silly and comical) , what really happened between beauty and beauty. the beast? I am amused by many criticisms and comments that seem to look too deeply into this film. I would not dare to say that it is a serious and obscure exploration of topics such as sexual frustration, longing, realization or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it an erotic horror movie. It is more the parody in all the genres that it touches or mentions, although it has some shocking moments in all the departments that surely will remain in his memory. <br /> <br /> The scene (too long) between an aristocratic young man The woman and the supposedly horrible, but the most ridiculous I've seen in the movies is a really impressive creature ... well anatomy, is set with the Scarlatti's harpsichord music and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed loudly at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is that beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is: who is the target audience of the film? For an erotic image, it is too verbose; for an art film: it has too many amazing scenes of pure madness and I would say an abrupt ending. In my opinion, the creator of the film did not pretend it was a serious drama. As a parody of art house / horror / erotica, it's fun and certainly original. Have fun and try not to look for a deep meaning. This story of Curious Beauties and Lustful Beasts is certainly not recommended to co-see with children. The opening scene that can surprise an unsuspecting spectator far more than the infamous bestiality scene can be used successfully on the On Discovery channel for the show as "In the world of animals: mating habits and rituals of horses" .
