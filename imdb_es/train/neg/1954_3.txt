First, let's get it out of the way. . . Yes, this movie steals a lot from 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Falls' is something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her for revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who, yes, hides her face) unleashes her furious revenge on almost anyone. A little too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But, what you should ask is this: if you're going to directly steal the exact plot of a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'Darkness Falls'? ? Of course, he won a few dollars at the box office, but that was strictly due to the rather good theatrical experience that the film provided. A direct movie to low budget video will not have the same effect. And it was not so. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations increased. There seemed to be at least some production value. The story did not seem terrible, simply flagrant. After the first scene, we have a cast of characters that includes a former doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and a veterinary student (Jenifer from 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer' by Argento). After those few minutes, however, the film slowly goes down the drain. It serves for all the basic horrible clich√©s that include, among others, a: a crazy person with an unattended warning, the foolish athlete, the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this movie was its inability to stay in the target audience. It is as if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone of any character that was on screen at that moment. When adults were on screen, I had a more mature feeling. When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on screen, the dialogue was reduced to a more stupid, immature, immature level. When the child was on the screen, it felt like an episode of 'Are you afraid of the dark?'. . . Only less fear. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is everywhere. The images range from pretty good to boring. Writing is unsatisfactory, as is acting for the most part. On the positive side, there is a bit of excessive bleeding in some parts (including a pretty cool (albeit painfully predictable) shipyard scene) and a rather cruel nail gun scene. Also, if you're looking for a bit of sexy, there's a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this girl topless, there are better movies to do that). Apart from that, there is not much to worry about when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (do they exist?), maybe you can take a look. To see the story made in a different way. . . but, that's the only reason why I can find her to see this one. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
