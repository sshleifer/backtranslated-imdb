I should not be surprised when I tell you that Alone in the Dark is a fucking movie. To put it bluntly, it is as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result and then vomited. The final product would still eclipse this movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on an old (!) Atari Videogame, the film has something to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of Demons, and ancient civilizations. Something that there are two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (Guess what is ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago, an advanced civilization really super-duper opened the portal, the demons came and had a great time, then eliminated civilization. That's why we've never heard of them, convenient enough. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps sighing for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator who got something wrong. When I was 10 years old. It is in the way of one of the artifacts of that advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to find out what happened to that civilization a long time ago. But Carnby believed that he would not be able to find the answers he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But look, these beasts are out and they get their prey in various ways, such as by gutting them, dividing them in half, implanting neurological control devices in them, or simply turning them into killer zombies. Yes, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> That's all the distilled thing I can do the plot. It is quite complicated and incomprehensible. In similar films, one could see the intrepid researcher / adventurer discover things step by step, and when the audience is mentally with the researcher, it is very fun. But when scenes change from one attack to another without perspective or context ... it's not that much fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, except for Slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be on stage). movie) showed that he was able to carry the acting charge. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is chosen as curator of the museum! Honestly, I thought I had seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was chosen as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here coincides with Richards, the shitty emotions for fucking emotions. Highlights include Reid pronouncing "Newfoundland" as "New Land of Fownd," Reid handing out most of his lines in a dazed and monotonous tone (a bit like he's been in a bender all night during the last week before of the film), Reid Curator of the museum, look: he spends a large part of the film wearing dress pants and jeans that are waist-high. Oh yes, she was as credible as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why are beautiful girls so stupid? (Note: I do not think Tara Reid is so attractive, she seems to have a perpetual need for food). Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders. of 713. Dorff's character was not terribly well developed, but nothing in the film was, from the sets to the characters and Tara Reid. But I'm rambling. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the disconcerting and absolutely absurd plot is hard enough to continue with the film moving at such a vertiginous pace, but the director Uwe Boll launches a soundtrack that hits the mind; It's so strong that you can not hear what the actors say in some of the scenes! That can not be correct. However, given the level of performance, perhaps Mr. Boll should be thanked. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a funny note. The initial moments of the film include the narration ... of the words that are dragged across the screen at the same time. Do you remember the first Star Wars? You heard that now familiar theme of Star Wars while dragging the prologue. Surely there was no need for narration; Why do I need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking at blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so strong, they were also taking care of people with hearing problems. In addition, the narrator inexplicably had a whisper in the first lines of the crawl, and then lost it. Strange. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark is a noisy and stunned hodgepodge of a terrible performance, an incoherent script and a heavy-handed direction. Just one note sounds real. There is so much chaos that the audience simply stops worrying about the characters and the roots of their disappearance. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem fresher and much more developed in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way. I can not give it the lowest rating, because I had little hope that it would start, and because it never attracted me enough to make me uneasy. It is atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a little.
