So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and suspense movie. I'm crazy and I was afraid to see this movie at the beginning, but seeing it, it's neither horror nor suspense. <br /> <br /> Basically I was making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what was going to happen next. The young actors were good at playing their characters, but I have to say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game, acting wisely. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will give accessories for the plot because it was good, but it is not exciting or scary. There were almost zero scenes of "jumping in your seat". So, do not waste ten dollars watching it in theaters, wait until it's a DVD.
