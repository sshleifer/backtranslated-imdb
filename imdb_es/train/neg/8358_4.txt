This is not one of the best movies of Arbuckle or Keaton, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of her excessive drinking, so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) says he has a guaranteed cure. Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery. Then, he escapes and they chase him through the place where he meets a beautiful girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the fact that the staff chases them, they escape, at which point it becomes clear that the girl is crazy and that Arbuckle is recaptured soon. However, he wakes up and everything AFTER the surgery has been a dream: there was not a sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton is not as incompetent as he seemed in the dream. <br /> <br /> Failing Humor is the biggest problem in the movie. Of course, mocking people with mental illness is quite low, but in his day he guaranteed laughter. I would laugh, too, if there was something funny to answer! A lot of energy and that's it. <br /> <br /> For your information, during one of the chase sequences, Fatty makes a run for men who weigh more than 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds of that?). And, shortly after, it returns to a position in which the number 5 is freshly painted. As a result, the five is now on the back of Fatty's shirt and looks like a regular participant. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD have appeared backwards in Fatty's shirt, but it came out in front, a mistake, since they should have realized that the mirror image should have been the reverse 5.
