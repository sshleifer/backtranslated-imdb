Terrible performance of Potter and a flat plot without any tension. And as for the feminist polemic, it's laughable. I saw this garbage when it was launched for the first time and although I found it tedious beyond belief, I'm glad I went to see it. That's because now I have an immediate answer to the question "what is the worst movie you've seen?" Also, I have the consolation of knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson. But I must admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a script that would get the maximum amount of grants from the arts council around the world (as revealed in the final credits). <br /> <br /> Only very recently I saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons in making that movie. All he needed was a lot of costumes, some fixed looks from the protagonist, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema that was made public. So, why should not I think that I could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is the lesson of tango?
