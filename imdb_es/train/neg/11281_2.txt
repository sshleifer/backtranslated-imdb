I have given this film a high 2-star rating, since I personally appeared in the 42nd and 43rd minutes of the film ... the scene in the sidebar of Russia. In this scene, the director of the film offered me the immortal line: "50 dollars ... you drink and you talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than me, so I refused to take this . part of speech in I was a bit surprised because this was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could have ended there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Quite frankly, dear". Import a damn. "If I had spoken that single line, my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminum as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> As time passes, I I consider it fortunate that my name is not connected in any way with this film. <br /> <br /> Although I spent a whole day on the set, at The Access Point in South Wales, Barry Island, no one could tell me which one It was the real story, the restorers and the wardrobe lady agreed that there seemed to be a lot of insults and nudity ... things could certainly have been worse if I had ended up naked in this terrible movie ... <br /> <br /> Still ..... On the positive side ... I started chatting with Rhys Ifans during a break, I had no idea who he was, since "Notting Hill" had not yet been released, and no It was an indication that I could be Welsh. I made several inappropriate comments about what a terrible hole Barry Island had become since my childhood visits in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized he was in a quality production ........
