Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone unless he gets some kind of creative control. He plays an annoying and annoying character that basically comes with a slight delay and speed. Do you want to know the only fun parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, his interpretation of the take on me is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can say that you are making a great effort to be a physical comedian, something that you should not have to try because it is one. And yet, his bit of 'demolition of the vet's office' becomes terribly bad. This movie made me develop a contraction of the eye. Avoid it at all costs and keep watching SNL.
