This episode beautifully filmed and scripted was disappointed for two reasons. 1) Maybe it was the morality of speaking in the 1950s, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) He was not an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins to this episode if Lo had done well. In fact, the modernization of sex-bots is in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode occurred, so at least they could have made it act like one. His flesh then would have added a spooky element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful little love story about two humans in a distant star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. Normally nobody cared. But this episode seemed paralyzed by a Calvinist morality that avoided what would have been masturbation with a machine, or an absolute carelessness.
