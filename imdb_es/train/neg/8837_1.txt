This movie is terrible. I really wanted to do it, since I thought "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, the good things: it looks great, some of the performances are good. The bad things are everything else about it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you probably know, is about some guys that go fishing and discover a body, with the turn they find on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they return. in the mobile range (cell phone). However, the film takes time (boy, take your time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> Of the set of characters (around a dozen), nobody seems to like another (that is, I guess, consistent, because they are all unpleasant). I felt extremely frustrated by the fact that I did not adequately explain how the characters are related, and it was not until the end of the film that I was able to vaguely build the family tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a relentlessly implacable film, which is a failure in the structure of the story, since the character's life seems as bad before the fishing trip as after. Once you have set the bar so high, it is difficult to overcome everyone by committing suicide. <br /> <br /> There are stupid errors in logic. The killer pours the body into the lake, and then somehow travels miles up the mountains. The fishermen leave Sunday morning, but for some reason, Byrne arrives home late at night after his wife has gone to bed. Then, early the next morning, the policemen knock on the door to take him to the station. Um, have not you heard about the phone? Down at the station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported on the body? <br /> <br /> What is missing in the story is the debate that the guys probably had after finding the body. This is a mystery: everyone asks them "how could you do that?" and the public is asking the same question. (The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what you would do in your situation. Someone has to walk to the car, drive to the mobile area, call the police, wait and guide them back to the location. If others wait in the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> A lot of this seems fake. The only thing that sounded true was that, since the girl was black, the local aborigines took the actions of the fishermen as racist: "they would not have done it if it were a white girl". <br /> <br /> In everything there is a curious indifference towards who could have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once), and there is no mystery, since the audience sees the killer in the initial scene . <br /> <br /> So I am sitting at the same time bored and confused, when there is a turn, not in the plot, but in the theme. Suddenly, it's about the quiet dignity of the dueling aborigines that leads to a ridiculous end with some incoherent things about black-white reconciliation. Hey? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film "at its best", according to The Age.
