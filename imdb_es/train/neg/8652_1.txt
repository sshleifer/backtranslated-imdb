Before I started with this movie, I thought it might be a good movie, but when I started with it, I thought it was really horrible. They said the movie is being made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the movie is shot in India. You can see the Indian made cars. You can see lars drinking bisleri (an Indian watermark), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * is really fun and many more things that show that they have not been shot in Afghanistan. I think you should not waste your time watching this movie ... pure waste of time ... I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or it might be the best idea, but do not see this waste of time
