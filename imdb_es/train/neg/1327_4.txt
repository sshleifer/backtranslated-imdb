This terrible film brings together all the Asian stereotypes you can imagine in a horrible package. Grabbing money, shrewd Japanese businessmen send police Pat Morita, foolish but lovable, to retrieve industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets a heel Jay Leno, who quickly refers to a murder victim as a Japanese and calls Morita Tojo. Everything is downhill from there.
