This movie was slower than the Molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who gave the preview must receive a prize for achieving each of the 30 seconds that took part in the preview. I had to wake up the people I was seeing him with, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for waking them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is busy with the hope that something really happens, but nothing ever happens. It was easy to lose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and unobtrusive. At the end of the movie, you expected everyone to die. Everyone runs around being despicable, petty or pitiful, and generally all three. <br /> <br /> And, what's worse, we saw a minute or two of added functions, just to give you a kick and laughs that you understand, and all we saw was people who were being presumptuous about how socially aware they are. If they had spent time in the movie they patted themselves on the back, it could have been worth seeing. <br /> <br /> They brought me waiting for the emotion of '24 '. I received a lecture on social consciousness through the blue eyes of the sand man.
