At the beginning, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really, boys, this shows the difficulties of a genuine interpretation of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was completely disappointed in the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and the story badly explained. The novel - first! - I was not destined to focus on an adventure! That is just the environment. In the film, the focus is reversed on that and the message has been withdrawn. In addition, the visual effects to show the energy of all living beings and the clarification of events at the end were parsimonious! They ruined it! ... I will never see him again!
