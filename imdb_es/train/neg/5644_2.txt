What happened to the drama of British television? From John Major through Tony Blair, the gender approach seems to have shifted from social realism to deceptively normative stories focused on women about the inner problems of middle-class professionals. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ does not) Do not buy good things? Please, let it be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> The long career of the writer in soaps probably explains why the dialogue consists mainly of old cliches. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong in meaningful looks, each held by the director for at least a half dozen beats more than they deserve. However, dismal appearances are a poor substitute for depth of character, if the writer has not provided such material for the actors to work on. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is theoretically a thriller, about a murder investigation; but that is not as important as the failed marriage of the central character and its concomitant problems. Is the husband of Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will your child be completely traumatized by the breakdown of the marriage? The fact that these are the central problems is not a sign of perception, it indicates a deeply narcissistic identification on the part of the writer and director with a character who should continue with her work. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write this so that she feels as if it matters and involves viewers who are not neurotic confined at home; Obviously, Paula Milne is not up to the task.
