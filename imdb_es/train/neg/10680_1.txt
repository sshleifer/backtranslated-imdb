SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made, it's that simple. There is no redeeming quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated: they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while you see that the stolen and poorly executed scenes are executed without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their advanced powers of teleportation, for example, Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk), and then ends up in his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon presented an unfortunate performance when Kate, worsened by the dialogue of rupture of the space-time continuum that seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grade student. An example of this would be when she said: "Lantern!" in such a stupid way that shows the threshold of how much a human body can shrink before it breaks in half. Finally, the editing of this film was, by far, the strangest and most horrifying I've ever seen. It was as if the cameramen were a group of chimpanzees to whom the scientists had given them camcorders. An example of this would be when we suddenly approached the headlights of Alex's car. I would bet there was little or no time spent editing this movie. The ending was absolutely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create some kind of mysterious plot that caused the viewer to say "oh, yes!" Instead, we have to see a silly painting of a spider that somehow fits the story line. Unfortunately, there is not a prospect in the millions that can save this movie from being a piece of festering garbage. <br /> <br /> I give it a .5 out of 10, the .5 is the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming an image book.
