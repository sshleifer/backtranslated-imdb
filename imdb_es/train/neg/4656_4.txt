Remake unremarkable and unforgettable of an old and famous English film. Although it can be too slandered as a total disaster (which it is not), it never creates any tension and betrays its television origins. Richard Burton walks asleep through his role, and the closed face of Sophia Loren (in this film) does not show much passion either. (**)
