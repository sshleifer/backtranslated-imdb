This series gets 2 stars just because it puts some Dickens' Bleak House in the movie and maybe someone reads the book. Contrary to what has probably been received from the opinion, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. It was awkward and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I interrupt myself and I respond to all the people who say: "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take the opinion of this guy because he is basing his evaluations on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role due to bad acting, whether or not she read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (although too old). The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it with the book, but because the different lines of the plot and the characters simply do not come together to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and convincing entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make a pretty good Bleak House, you must spend 20 hours of film in 10 episodes of two hours. But I suggest that the producers, etc., leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television dulls the genius of Dickens as manifested in his witty plots and unforgettable characters.
