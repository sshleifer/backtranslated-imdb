"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, although I would not use "horror" or "thriller" if I described it. It is more a minor study that seems oddly sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner plays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well played by Artel Kayàru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the most interesting character: he is in love with Dahmer and, once he escaped an attack, returns to Dahmer to have sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how the events may have created the human monster we see on the screen and offers no idea of ​​Dahmer's belief. that he could create sexual zombies of his victims. <br /> <br /> The roles are well interpreted but the story is thin.
