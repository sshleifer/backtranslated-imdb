Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so well together in THE HAND OF MOM, return for this very minor Universal Horror offer. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comic "Babe," we have Fuzzy Knight replacing him as a silly friend called "Stuff." But the results are not so charming, and the level of fear is practically nil. <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who has the idea of ​​leading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside an old spooky castle. Peggy is one of the gangs that comes for the ride. But there is a tall, thin man, John Carradine, with a black cape and a big hat known as "The Ghost", who crashes at the party in search of buried fortune. <br /> <br /> This "ghost" is not very Mysterious, and no effort is made to try to keep his face of man half in the shade to create tension or chills. It's always nice to see Moran happy, but otherwise, you can write this down as one of the flaws of fire that are instantly forgotten by Universal.
