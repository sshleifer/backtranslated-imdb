It does not even deserve a review, rather than as a warning to potential viewers. It's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress stalking a studio during the filming of a World War II drama. There is no fear involved, no suspense at all, no surprises. A shocking moment that seems too stupid to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there are some really nice editions from time to time. History never comes together, and movies are really a total failure. 4/10.
