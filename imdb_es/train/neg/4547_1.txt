The movie was TERRIBLE !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in recent years. One of those movies I'll be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of. Thanks for giving me an answer to that burning question "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestina Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then treated the audience as if we were behind schedule. There is no history and the history that is there is paralyzed by too much magic and coincidence. It is a pity that they have to explain the nine prophecies and can not simply include them in a story that is entertaining to follow. They did not spend time developing the character and it was easy not to care if a character died. It was shameful to be one of the few people who stayed until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also quite boring, but I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest that you do not see it if you want to keep the words of the book close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
