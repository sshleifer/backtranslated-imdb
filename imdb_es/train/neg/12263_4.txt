Watching this movie, as I did for the first time in Turner Classic (which lists it as "Dangerous Woman"), can only multiply its appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez should have been paid by the smile. I hope you remember your dentist and your Brylcreem salesman in your will; They made him the actor he was. Women are all good, but not better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost none of the changes in the atmosphere of their successors in the papers, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential sobriety of their characters in the remake; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) Can not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not suck exactly; There it lies like a large slice of ham. Its main value today is as a reminder that great films like the '41 "Falcon" do not happen. On the scale of 1 to 10 I rate it with a 4, mainly for work with the camera and support players.
