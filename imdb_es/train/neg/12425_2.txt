I do not know what they are inhaling, but please stop. This movie was a complete garbage. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was adorable, cute, sweet, loving and extremely fun to watch. He had that innocence, but at the same time, he was strong too. <br /> <br /> This new boy, Alex? Upset like all hell! Only a flagrant truce in trying to match the charm and grace of Culkin, failing miserably in that. <br /> <br /> The villains, complete shit. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining screen team. They were comical, they were comical and they only made you want to encourage Culkin even more, which is what a good villain is supposed to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just argue and again, we try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. I'm not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable, not even so entertaining. More on the cheesy side actually. <br /> <br /> Then we got the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classic. Memorable. Perfect to look around Christmas and it brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and worry about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Garbage masterpiece. I already said <br /> <br /> In general, I do not know why people like this. I think people really do not know what a good movie is anymore. It's a scam scam with more unrealistic traps and a new stupid main character, which I want the thieves to at least hit the crap. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this garbage. And do not even start with Part 4!
