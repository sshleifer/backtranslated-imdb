I created my own reality when leaving the theater, when my girlfriend invited me to go to this night with her mother. We (my friend and I) left in an hour. What a load of pseudoscientific jargon of the new era. <br /> <br /> Subatomic particles are thoughts? By sticking labels to water bottles and blessing them by a Buddhist monk, did little pretty crystals grow? A 25% drop in the homicide rate in DC occurred when a group of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days in a row during the same time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the homicide rate? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW- It was funded by the cult Ramtha, whose leader was one of the "experts" interviewed by the filmmakers. There are no ulterior motives here, right?
