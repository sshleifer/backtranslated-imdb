This movie is easily one of the worst I've seen. And I do not mean that in a good way. We wanted to see a fucking horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed to be the worst in the store. For once, the movie was everything we had hoped for. And more! (Or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> It seems that the actors are reading their lines of posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing transparent red plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? I do not even mean the script ... And just when you thought it could not get worse, it turns out that the first part of the movie was Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> <Br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you like horror movies, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
