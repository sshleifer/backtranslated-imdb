I really love the action movies and sexy science fiction of the sixties and it's because of the actress who appeared in them. They found the most attractive women in these movies and it did not matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed in this movie was because it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has a European science fiction movie called "Dragonfly" and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) complete the film. They're a really beautiful woman in the movie that plays Dragonfly but is barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his parents' exploits from his early days and puts it in the script. I wish the movie had been a tribute to those early films. They could have many cameos of actors that appeared in them. There is an actor in this movie who was popular since the sixties and his John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I guess I'll have to keep waiting for a director to pay a good tribute to the films of the sixties. If someone is reading this, "Make it as sexy as you can"! I'll be waiting!
