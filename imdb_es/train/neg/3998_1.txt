Can you say "All shock, no argument"? There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no story about the room other than the deaths. * WHY * was it evil? What did he do like that? Why a countdown "hour"? Then, there were unexplored things insinuated; for example, * we saw * a camera on the air outlet, which he mentioned. But when he went up to the vent, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all the ghosts seemed "digital" and things "disappeared" before hitting the ground making a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all those * things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech spy house. Except that there was no follow-up on that. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... the electronic devices do not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the cell phone has no signal, but wireless internet works well. How many incontinuities can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing more than "shock after shock." Everything has been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things out of place. Changing the paintings. Bleeding walls. The "Oh, everything was just a dream ... no, it was not". And, if the room was "evil", why have our main character accept the death of his daughter, if that would keep him trapped there forever? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no background information on "The first book" he wrote. Just a little bit of vague information about the "father was an imbecile" and so on. Speaking of dads, what about his father? "You will be in my place." <br /> <br /> In general, a HORRIBLE movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, with no new or innovative effects, and certainly no backup story, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My general impression is that the whole movie was made in the "Cheap"; practically using a set and a couple of location shots, and it was nothing more than a cheesy, recycled effect effects movie, "seen earlier than before".
