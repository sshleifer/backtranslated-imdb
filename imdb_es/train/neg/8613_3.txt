I almost started crying when I saw this movie. Not to laugh, but to the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had it at its best, and Back To School is by far the classic masterpiece of the 80s. Then there were the Ladybugs and that's when it started to appear. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a slight step forward from Ladybugs but he did not say much). <br /> <br /> In My 5 Wives Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love since that was his name in Easy Money) a rich man (he is not always) who loves women and marries as if nothing. Well, now he inherits a large portion of land and since the land was run by the Amish, he inherited 5 Wives. This sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is EVERYTHING. The script is so bad that Rodney seems to be saying his sentences to the camera and all the supporting characters have nothing to do. The film looks like it was shot on video with some really bad stunt sequences that obviously are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems to be dying to say the word F (which should be because the film has an R rating but plays like PG) and Jerry Stiller has a good 2 minute cameo. Do not get me wrong, sometimes I would laugh at some of Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is getting too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the movie becomes too PC, which thanks to the horrible 90s, Rodney of the 70s and 80s no longer works.
