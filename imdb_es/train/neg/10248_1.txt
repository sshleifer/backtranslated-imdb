The end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the picture, but keep in mind that it is bad. Being a big fan of the mega actor Christopher Lee, they cheated on me. Like the tentacles (77) a good cast does not mean it will be a good movie. The beginning looks promising and then it becomes tedious, many parts of the film are too dark to see what is happening. The rest of the cast is shown. briefly as: Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I would expect something better from the band of Charles, who made very funny movies like the re-animator and the dolls. I heard that Christopher Lee was tricked into making this movie. He told his companions that they were going to be Jos√© Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger. Well, Dean Jagger is there, but the other two never made it (thankfully) if they make a movie about the end of the world, use a bigger budget. better storyline.dean Jagger made two good movies later; crocodile (80) and the game of death (79). Sue Lyon (Lolita) is also in the movie, minus her lollipop. If you are a glutton for punishment, look at the end of the world that you dare say awake throughout the film.1 out of 10.
