Could it be for the same director that Do not look now or bad time? Badly acted <br /> <br />, edited clunkily. Just compare the various accident scenes in this one with similar ones in Do not look now to see how much Roeg has lost his touch <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell (with a somewhat coarse appearance these days, I'm afraid I should report) can not save this one. The plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the performance is wooden and Roeg's attempts at his trademark time dislocation are regrettable. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the plague.
