Sogo Ishii may be an expert filmmaker in the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a descendant of the Genji clan. The realization of the film has the main characteristics of a low budget production, which includes scenes of blurry fight and awkward montages (the kind that can be found in an insufficient production drama). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his destiny consists in defeating the mysterious spirit that keeps the Gojoe bridge in the night, but he does not realize that this decision will lead him directly to a conflict with almost all the elements of society in that moment, but that he could gain enlightenment. <br /> <br /> However, there is no lack of ambition in his description of the conflict between the holy and the mundane. Artsy flourishes in part from the help of photography and editing to compensate for the loose style of making movies. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
