First of all, I would like to point out that I only know the program because my younger sister always sees it. I think it's the most annoying program on television. There is nothing funny in any of the "jokes" and canned laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience. In that way, laughter would show how "without grace" the show is. However, I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. However, it makes me sick to think that they will look at the show again in the future and see how bad was their first television show. The program links well with the annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why today's youth needs to be shouted so much surpasses me. That is all.
