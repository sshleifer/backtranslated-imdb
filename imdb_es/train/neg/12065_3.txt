When I was a child and lived with my sister, she bought all the horror movies that she could find and this was one of them. The VCR had become an item for the home and we did not have more than 150 movies and we saw them all. <br /> <br /> I was at a garage sale the other day and saw this VHS Copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I bought any horror movies I did not have and I knew that this movie seemed familiar to me. I thought for a second and realized that it was one that my sister had bought. I had sold it years ago in a garage sale, I suppose, who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything about it and I saw it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was something new to me and I looked and enjoyed anything back then. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of horror, but there are certain requirements for me to consider it "good" and it fell short. It was one of those talks, talk, talk and bore the types of death. The scenes of death that you see are made using the shadow on the wall followed by splashes of blood and that if you're lucky, you get a lot. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I have seen some with similar arguments, so I think this should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless you're hard.
