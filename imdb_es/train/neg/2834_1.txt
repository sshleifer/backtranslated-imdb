Now I have seen Bo Derek's four vehicles run by her husband, John; They are all pretty terrible, of course, but this is certainly the worst. With the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting? For the director, naturally? and acting, not to mention the star's naked nudity, is about her losing her husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts the suicide of her shotgun by saying that he had always admired Hemingway!) but that she keeps showing up and talking to she. In fact, he wants to go back into another, younger body, but he actually does it alone in the last scene! Derek is charming as always, and he keeps playing na√Øve (!) ?? especially during a confusing middle section that is chased by a hit man in a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but this is easily his nadir; In addition, for much of the duration, it acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting it is in some kind of limbo)! His "replacement", then, is obviously a handsome looking stallion who does not have a dash of talent or even personality. Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans, Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife)? Plus a stunning cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably needed this on his resume)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his own director of photography in the film, that the final credits are full of useless (and cheesy) expressions of gratitude to the many people who gave a hand, and that GHOSTS CAN NOT DO IT. the 1990 Razzie Awards!
