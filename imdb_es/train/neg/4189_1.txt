I had the clear misfortune of catching up with two of the worst movies of 2004 one another this morning: first, the incoherent vacuum of The Chronicles of Riddick, driven by the CGI, and then, the shameful vanity project known as Greendale. One cost multimillionaires and the other cost cents, but both are bad. Really, very bad. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am not the biggest Neil Young fan in the world, but he has contributed his share of classic songs: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young's compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man has written some really cool songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale, and very few good ones, and the film around which they are built is a truly cringeworthy and simplistic political slogan. Completely without merit as art and as impressive as polemic, Greendale is better left behind. Buy the book if you feel obligated to contribute to Young's bank account.
