In a word, this movie was boring. He lacked life and spark. A big problem is with the two drivers. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. He was bored, and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The images were interesting, but the scenes did not improve. In any case, the images tended to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the action sequences felt real, and therefore, the film did not create any real drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but I needed a better script, better acting and a better director. I kept thinking during the movie, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford were Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the criticism of this movie. I think critics praise the film because they "want" to like it and want it to be successful even though it fails on many different levels.
