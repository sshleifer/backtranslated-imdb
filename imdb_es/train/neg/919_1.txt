Although I must admit that I laughed more watching this movie than the last comedies I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget must have consisted of a change of actors pocket. The production values ​​are so low that they really made it very fun to watch. It reminds me of the Monster Robot made up of a guy in a gorilla suit and a cardboard helmet to dive. <br /> <br /> In one scene, an unfortunate victim cuts his arm and leg. Heavens, it's hard to believe, but the scene of the Black Knight of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim did not start shouting "No one will pass" and "It's just a flesh wound, I've had worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a point. Between the horribly cheap suit and the boy's geeky appearance, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Truly a movie that is bad enough to be seen. Something like watching a car accident in slow motion in a movie. <br /> <br />
