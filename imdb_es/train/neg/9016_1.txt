Dragon Fighter is the first science fiction channel (although I guess it's now called Syfy?), The original movie I've seen. But I've seen one or two more since then, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is wrong, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens in the end is unexpected and out of place (if you have seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I did not want to ). put a spoiler in my opinion). In addition, there was a musical melody that was used in almost all dangerous sequences. That was really stupid; They just played it over and over again. And it is definitely not original; I know I've heard that somewhere before (I just can not remember where). This is one to avoid.
