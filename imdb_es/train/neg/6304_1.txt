As an amateur of the naval history of World War II, and someone who is not proud of the history of race relations in this country, I was eager to see this movie. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I got about 3/4 of the way, but I should have turned it off in the secondary attack scene. The idea of ​​a submarine firing a torpedo at a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then being able to "run away" from the DDE while it is submerged, is absurd. And that's just a small detail. The whole movie was badly written, misdirected and badly performed. I agree with others in this forum that this could have been a good movie. It is as if they had decided that, since all those propaganda films of the Second World War were made with totally white molds, they needed to make one with black people. And as bad as those old movies were, this is really worse. And it almost smells like false advertising head Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out they had very small roles. I have to believe that those two good actors were ashamed to be associated with this movie. I've finished. I've given this fucking movie too much of my life.
