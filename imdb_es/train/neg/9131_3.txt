I can hardly believe that I saw this again after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago, I saw 6 Fu movies in a row ... Boris Karloff and the 5 Chris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both directed (and I use that word simply) by Jess Franco, were abominable. At that moment, I skipped this one, remembering that, in some way, it was still WORSE. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it. Never more. Do you know what is worse than an abominable movie? A really well made piece of S ***. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. It's a VERY pretty movie. GREAT production design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly with a good cast, some decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, ¡¡ one of the WORST SCRIPTURES in the history of cinema! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... one could mistake this for a decent movie. And then they start singing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and it's going downhill. Having Burt Kwouk (whose teacher says, "Your face ... is familiar") accidentally spilled Fu's elixir vitae to put out a fire, which resulted in his condemnation of torture, burial and cutting of his ears, It was the closest thing to how funny they were. It was as if someone decided he wanted to make a "country" movie, so ridiculous that it would be funny. RIDICULOUS, it's ... FUNNY ... THERE'S NO. Throughout. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a LOT of research in the Fu Manchu series to be able to "do the right thing". With a different script, either a very FUN, or a VERY SERIOUS one, they could have ... they could ... They should have a classic in their hands. A film that could have made you forget the horror of those atrocities of Jess Franco ... instead of making one want to unearth them as masterpieces, in comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 70s when a whole series of classic characters from the 1930s were revived in films that were universally horrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, the lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure, this may be the worst of all. It took a great deal of self-control not to move quickly in whole sections of it, especially in the scenes that contained Sid Caesar (the FBI boss who was also Al Capone's cousin, do you understand what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the film are not fun ... they often do not make any sense. Like when they "audition" the police officers to pose as the King and the Queen, and we ended up watching people "audition" the routines of the dance hall like singing, dancing and riding on unicycle. How many drugs did the writers have to take from this so that some of this would make sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a pity ... and a real waste of all that talent, including Peter Sellers (who played with both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who had been in a Chris Lee Fu in his time), Helen Mirren (the police that falls surprisingly in love with the villain and almost steals the last half hour of the movie). I begin to wonder if anyone will ever have a "proper" Fu Manchu movie, or if the fans will have to settle for Karloff being almost the ONLY one.
