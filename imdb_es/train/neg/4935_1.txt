"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the program: Cavemen are an alternative race, face prejudice, etc. Possibly the stupidest idea ever created; Almost being worth jail time for writers. A show presented the cavemen who went to a club, trying to pick up the girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of listening to a 22-minute Andy Rooney dialogue, followed by death by meat knives through dwarf cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of dialogue: "Surely you agree to go out with a caveman." "Yes, it's fine, I've had about 10 thousand!" Hilarious ... Possibly the best writing I've ever witnessed. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup, facing difficult social problems ... It seems like an entertaining night. I also love how bad recent ideas are that they resort to making a sitcom for auto insurance ads. I wonder if they are going to do the Gecko next, in order to have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say that this is worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was ripped from something that was inspired. <br /> <br /> Programs like this make me hope that there is a comet there somewhere directed to Earth. <br /> <br /> (Indomitable honestly ...)
