What ends up killing this movie is its self-awareness, among other things. Here is a short list: 1. irreverent behavior. when the Beatles approached and injected their behavioral / humor mark "peculiar, irreverent", it was received as new. That was more than 4 decades ago. overcome it. <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. the base, the quasi-sociopolitical-isms is a difficult terrain to make work comically. Ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3. the postmodern "I am hard in this false world and yes, I recognize it in myself". The snake eats itself, used as an illustration with another animal in the movie! - It's such a retread. <br /> <br /> 4. Smarmy, presumed joy. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur writing, acting, directing ... have you ever seen student films? A victim of herself, almost the only thing I can say positively is that she at least has a sense of herself and, of course, I am now stuck in the self-reflective thing that she says is worthwhile, of value. <br /> <br /> but towards ... what? Ultimately, it just sounds as hollow as any other pretentious piece. Hey, have you ever seen the version of Woody Allen in Bergman, that is, "Interiors"? Well, this only makes him more amateur.
