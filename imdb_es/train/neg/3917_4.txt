"The house of the spirits" is quite horrible. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship like the one that tries to describe the film, and although everyone knows that movies can be very far from reality, this particular film treats the audience as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as the ones that appear here and, of course, the political processes are much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "La casa ...". If you can not show that the complexity on the screen is better not to make a movie at all. There are many examples of how you can take politics seriously in the cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some places I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear between parrots and palm trees. When talking about certain things, you should not only be careful, but also respectful with the intelligence of your audience.
