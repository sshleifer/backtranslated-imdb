This movie is not good, it's not good at all. Some memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice to combine Norma Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell has everything working for her, the woman and / or minor actress of Marilyn. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of his limited career. 3/10
