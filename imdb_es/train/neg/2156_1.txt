I know the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for centuries and it was only recently that I had the opportunity to see this adaptation. I have heard many positive comments about this, so I had high hopes. Once this movie was over, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. "Good evening, Mr. Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and was practically lost sight of in book 4.5 / 10. In particular, I found that many of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue. It was rushed and moved too fast, but most of it bothered me the fact that you could never see the union and love between William Beech and Tom in this movie, which was a real disappointment. The casting was not so good, either. I thought that this could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. This deserves a decent remake that should be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.
