I registered in IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that, somehow, I had the willpower not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a decent number of action films and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting consists of moving the swords back and forth without thinking and expecting the opponent not to be doing the same. I have seen many student movies with better action and more solid arguments. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with little action, and virtually no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film does not even have action and shows the development of the relationship with the Princess and the farmer / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has several story lines, and none of them are really worth it. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been that I saw the copy, which was pretty bad. The entire cast muttered all its lines so it was difficult to follow what was happening. But I have the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the film in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard that this is a futuristic action / ninja movie, then you've listened badly. That's what I thought it was when I found out, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Stay well away from it.
