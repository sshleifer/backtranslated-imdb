Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his online readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. Swap shameless beards and nonsensical repairs with Brooke Shields as if it were a block of wood with backward hair; even his smallest touches (like touching a nonexistent mustache on his grizzled face) do not reveal as much a character as an insecure actor directed by himself, an insecure filmmaker. In the southwest, around 1950, a poor player (who is not a bit deceitful) beats Lolita, an orphan teenager in a failed poker game; After seizing a treasure map that promises gold in the Grand Canyon, the two in dispute become prospectors. Some enchanting views, and a strange but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a gray-haired cannon man, are the only trade-offs in the weary dramatic comedy, with two tracks followed by cartoonish assassins who will stop at nothing until they put their hands on it. . Map. Shields is very pretty, but, although the camera loves its bright and shiny beauty, it has no presence on the screen (and its little voice has no rank); Every time she opens her mouth, one bends to shrink or bend over. * 1/2 of ****
