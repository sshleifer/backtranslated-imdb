The real-life philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman to help entertain troops arriving and leaving the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco, launched this star-studded Warner Bros. greeting patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances as a love-hate romance develops between a budding star and a painfully green and thin Air Force Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bike). It seems that the corporal has tricked the actress into thinking that she is going to battle when in fact she is part of a crew of an airplane that flies to and from Honolulu (one would think that she would be happy that he was out of danger, but instead it acts). Like most children's women in the films of the 1950s). Doris Day is available for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinctive laugh and brave number of songs are very nice. Roman is also here, with a glamorous aspect, while James Cagney mocks his character on the screen and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Jane Wyman sings, too, in a repetition next to the hospital bed following the example of Doris Day, causing one to wonder: "They ran out of sets?" For the undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. Even so, low-income production and the appropriate technical aspects make "Starlift" strictly a second invoice. * 1/2 of ****
