- A newly married couple moves into the house of the husband's ex-dead wife. It is not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone does not want her at home. She sees skulls all over the house. But when the husband investigates, he can not find anything. Is someone trying to take her back to the nursing home she was recently discharged from? Or, is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I've seen The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K team. And, in all likelihood, it will be the last time you see it this way. Can you say boring? I'm not talking ordinary boring, I'm talking about how the grass becomes boring. There are large sections of the film where nothing happens. The screen could have gone blank and it would have given me so much entertainment. The characters continue buzzing with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not help much. Most of them offer lines with the sentence normally reserved for a primary school game. I have not looked for it, but I would be surprised to find that someone related to this film has appeared in something of cinematic value. I will not even go into the script with which the actors have to work. Let's say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered in the movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Or avoid this at all costs or, at least, look for the MST3K version.
