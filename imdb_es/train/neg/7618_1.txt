This is not cinema. It is not talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. It is nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says: "Devil! COOL!" Yeah sure. The only good thing about this experience was the only fact that I did not buy it, but I rented it. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as a bad telenovela. No wait. Telenovelas at least professional LOOK ... sorta. Is? This looks like it was filmed with someone's video camera. It is awful! Unhappy! Sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is detestable! WHO is this director anyway? I do not even care enough to look for it. He stinks! The performances of these unprepared poor actors were much better than this crap-fest deserved. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> That registers around 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
