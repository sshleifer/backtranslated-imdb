I have seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and I liked most of them, but it literally gave me a headache. The edition of John Gurdebeke is too frantic and, apart from a sequence of force tours that show a line of heads bending to look at an object, it only interferes with the ability of the actors to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I did not like about this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's previous works, although his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the films a predominant feeling of humanity. This seemed rather a hardness for the sake of hardness. <br /> <br /> As I have to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my criticism, I will mention that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" manages to simulate his facial expressions quite well.
