I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and I've probably reviewed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than anyone else. All the films that he made from the beginning of his career until the beginning of the 30s, with only two exceptions, I have reviewed them, so you can see that I am a big fan. This is why I found this episode so painful and difficult to see. I loved the films of this man and I kept thinking "Buster, how could you?" Well, now that I think about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this scary episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He had lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a protagonist had also passed. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity, so he prostituted himself with anyone who was willing to pay, appearing in the Beach movies and in this mess of an episode of a great series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it is terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show is supposed to be fun, but it's not, and instead of being a tribute to silent movies it's just painful to watch, especially when Keaton gets that stupid time-travel helmet, as well as all the bad slapstick executed. Do yourself a favor, GO TO THIS: it's a pale imitation of the greatness that was once Keaton's career!
