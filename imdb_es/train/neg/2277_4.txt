'The Vampire Bat' is definitely interesting, since it's one of the first horror movies set in the 1930s genre, but taken in isolation, it's all a bit squeaky for any genuine praise. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a European town sometime in the 19th century, where a series of murders are attributed to vampirism by suspicious locals. There is a feeling very similar to James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of the character of Lionel Atwill Dr Niemann, complete with his misconceptions for scientific advancement. <br /> <br /> The subject of the vampire is arbitrary and uniquely used as a false clue by the suspicion of falling into the simple-loving village of Herman bats (Dwight Frye), thus providing the excuse for a mob to wield a torch go to the uproar, as if they needed it. <br /> <br /> This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum') and like their other collaborations, the film suffers from inadvisable comic relief and a tendency to deviate from the horror to the elements of conventional suspense. However, taken in context, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> All we have left is a poor quality Frankenstein imitation, with vampire elements purely a device to fool Dracula fans. But for the title, the film would struggle to be considered a horror and it's worth noting that director Frank Strayer was making the 'Blondie' movies a few years later.
