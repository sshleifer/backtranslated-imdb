Body Slam (1987) is a terrible movie. The low budget stinks, the address is pedestrian (at best) and writing and acting are scarce. But if you like the old-school fight (from the 1970s to the mid-1980s), you'll be more entertaining than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on the ice. I gave him a two because he wanted to be generous. This turkey was "directed" by doubles teacher Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a group of fighters and actors of c-list (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair". rock "and wrestling, but there are others who do not want it to be successful, there is more, but I do not want SPOIL for you, if you can stand the bad performance and the tedious story, there are some surprises near the end for wrestling fans . <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to my worst enemy (and I mean it).
