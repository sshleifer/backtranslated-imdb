['And I mean ultra light. This movie has four giant stars, about three jokes and a half and nothing more than that. <br /><br /> There really is not much to say about this stinker, other than that, although it has a couple of really good snippets, most of it is not very fun. It does not work at all like a romance either. How about a romantic comedy? Not in your life Most dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, and much less fun. <br /><br /> What is really a premise is that the premise is not bad at all. This film could have been much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the false ways in which movies are promoted, with false quotes from critics. The film discovers the unexploited territory of the newsroom: those trips with all the expenses paid for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But, instead of exploring what should have been a lot of jokes, spend about three minutes in this territory and move towards the romance of the movie. <br /><br /> The same with the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones: the movie star who focuses on herself. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what he has given him, but has given him practically nothing. It&#39;s all homogenized scrap that looks very pale compared to some of the things we&#39;ve heard about the stars over the years. <br /><br /> In the end, it&#39;s hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a repeat of &quot;The Boat of Love.&quot; In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably be a better story. So, go ahead, tell us, filmmakers, what do you have of these stars that made them appear in this?']
