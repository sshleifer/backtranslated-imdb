... there is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to see him last night. It's just a small theater, but there's usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people who were watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was, by far, one of the worst I've seen in my life. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script and dialogue, direction, edition, etc. it was horrible! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of the Mangy Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and The Lord of the Rings. It was as if we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying the commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not just enter dino / dragon / lizard legions loaded with unexplained cannons. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but he introduces them and develops them in 3 movies, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The transitions of the scene are horrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was a very simple plot, I found myself losing myself in the holes of the plot. <br /> <br /> The characters were white Americans, but they spoke almost with broken English. due to the badly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have redeemed some value from the movie ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... although, in any case, he had not known her for a long time. He did not seem too upset to stay in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to return. We could not for God's sake find out where he was or how he got there, but if he was not upset, we should not be. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why the dress What Sarah's spirit was looking like it had borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... the 3 main characters of the hero were reincarnations to finish the job. Sarah completes her homework and moves to the next life. Jack also does this. So why is Ethan screwed? He has been left alone, without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him return. What is he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And if he returns home, does he return to his job? I should have given him the same mercy to be killed outside the movie that the other heroes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money on this movie. We only stayed until the end because we had paid for it, but as soon as the credits arrived, we went out the door.
