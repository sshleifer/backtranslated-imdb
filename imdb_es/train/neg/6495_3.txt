I rented this movie because of the merits of what the trailer showed and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack were to join David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end. result. I do not think I've seen a movie like this that made an LSD trip resemble an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It is a set of pieces where the characters appear and disappear from reality, or several realities, and the film does not end in anything until the last 5 minutes, where it suddenly makes sense. I wrote a scathing critique on my movie review blog that basically reveals everything, and I will not do it here. It's a well-acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me tell you, if there's a feature that redeems this movie, it's music. It is perfect. Part of the dialogue is incredibly good, and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed parts of this movie, I really did, and once you get to the end, I actually find out what's really going on It's unfortunate that you have to go through 2 hours of madness to get to a highlight , which minimizes the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that The real problem with this movie is not the acting, it's all.
