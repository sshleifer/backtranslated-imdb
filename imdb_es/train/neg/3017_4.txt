Now I had the best intentions to see this one. I like something about Tony Scott's work, and also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard the contrary from other people. But this was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. Everything was too much. Let me elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was exaggerating, and not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ram√≠rez and Christopher Walken, but their time on the screen simply could not save the film. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that leaped into their originality, but somehow it felt as if they had been written by someone other than the main writer. A certain melody was used about 4 times, which really started to fail after the second time. I am a firm believer in not using the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> In addition, the edition was actually done in this case, since the cut rate is quite high. Oh, and the repeated echo of some of Keira's lines just sounded corny after listening for the second, third, fourth time, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to watch an action movie that is high-tempo and "something" fun, and that you do not mind everything I mentioned above, you may like it. . <br /> <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
