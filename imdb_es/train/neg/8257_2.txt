"The game of a gentleman" uses the game of golf in a country club to illustrate the discovery of a teenager about honesty, prejudices and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was going, just to prove I was wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the filmmakers knew where he was going. The defining moment in this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and belies any idea that he will become a mentor to the teenage golfer. Somehow, it's refreshing that this film refuses to follow most of the simplistic and overworked film formulas. However, a large part of it still comes as planned. In the blink of an eye, people abandon all pretensions of civility, or do not defend the things they believe in, or are exposed to something much less respectable than their place in society assumes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution for these moments. And except for the fact that the club serves as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linkage of them. It's a shame that the writers and the director can not save a better movie, especially considering some of the talented actors and the potential in the configuration.
