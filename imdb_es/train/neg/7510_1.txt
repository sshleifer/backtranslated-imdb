The film is a collection of clich√©s about almost everything there is. It has no focus, no goals, no real message. The symbolism is overcome and the stereotypes are abundant and scandalous. This film can not resist the temptation to make drama where it does not exist. Each small exchange of words immediately becomes a long and unjustified dialogue that is so typical of an essay in acting class. Where there is no substance in this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are) can not help but compensate with an exaggerated emotion, also known as "increase bets". About acting, to put it simply. The address does not help here. Nothing can save this non-history. He is forced, feigned and bored to tears. Inaccuracies in portraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and striking costumes of the 90's. The characters wander without a role, detail and motive. The locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Fever Saturday night, with meaning and art ripped off. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I will give you that. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This movie is Lee's fault. It ran out, like the rest of them. It became irrelevant. He has nothing interesting to say. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything of this kind again (whom I will refrain from naming from now on).
