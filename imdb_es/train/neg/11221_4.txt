Lolita is a rebel and will share with our open eyes some small stories of sex, between science fiction and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad acting, horrible music and a story without history. Any story and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well done, many lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good final and very hot strip show. Only for Lovell fans.
