The film is basically the story of the return of a Russian prostitute to her hometown for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are a couple of other minor stories that might be more interesting than the ones taken, but they are not fully explored. The core of the film is the funeral, the wake and the subsequent controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but now the artist who sold them is missing. Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an unbearable train journey and a stretch through the mud. Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The town itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and a male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and, finally, it seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that could cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not include the songs and cries of the crones. Do not go to this movie unless you are fluent in Russian.
