Recently I saw Landscapes manufactured at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I am a family and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I think the film does a good job of conveying its message, I could not help but feel that it was done as a complete reflection after the photographs and Burtynsky's subsequent popular book. Obviously, one of the reasons for this is the extensive use of photographs that present approaches and approaches. While this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the movie was just photos from Burtynsky's book (which I already have). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you have the book or are familiar with your work, it is better that you skip this one.
