Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' in the bargain and saw it with some friends thinking it was going to be an economical version of "Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that they spent a good part of their budget on the cover, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We were attentive to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get into the car with a yuppie who is in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone. Actually, they talk to the boy before one of the girls kills him. but once they started driving the car, I could no longer suspend my disbelief. <br /> <br /> Some people really consider this a "so bad, it's good" movie, they're liars. I did not finish the film, but one of the other reviews mentions that at the end of the film they became police officers, which I'm glad I did not see until the end. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT LOOK!
