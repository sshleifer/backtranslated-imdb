There is a lot to like here. The actors are first class and the script provides a good dialogue that best captures the atmosphere of a very united and pleasant family. However, for that reason the film does not sound true. We see Leo, who apparently just found out about his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially reacts in a way that is not in tune with the supportive atmosphere he is in. In addition, the film ends somewhat abruptly, avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family had to deal with in light of his love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive, since he is usually the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the writers could not decide whether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional and attractive family, or on the devastation HIV has on the victim, so it only alludes to both. Although this film is reason for reflection, it leaves the viewer wanting much more than what it offers.
