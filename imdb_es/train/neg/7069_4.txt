When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster. But honestly, the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has a line of labels: "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means Sweet Love, but the Sacrifice is Immortal. In the film, the hero of the movie (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the protagonist (Pooja Gandhi) even though the two loved each other. Its justification is the meaning of the label line. This film influenced so many young broken hearts that they considered this attitude of "sacrifice similar to a loser" to be very reflective and, therefore, became the cult movie that is, when they could have moved on with their lives. Ganesh's performance in the film is Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. Actually, it looks funny in a song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when it is supposed to look elegant and great. Its appearance does not help the protagonist either. His hair is badly made in most of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Their costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good thing about the film is the excellent photography and the brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are really the real ones thanks to the movie. Also Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are very well written. The director Yograj Bhat has to be praised for his songs with good taste. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all in all, except for the songs, the movie is very normal !!!
