Wow. I do not even really remember much about this movie, except that it stunk. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; The parents of a girl neglect her, so this sick Pokemon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one disturbed by that? Then, this weirdo Pokemon kidnaps Ash's mother to pretend it's from the girl. I do not care if he was trying to make the girl happy, that's just disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a plaintive child who wanted things her way. She played with Unowns, was the "daughter" of Entei and apparently could grow old and shrink on a whim with the help of her "dad". <br /> <br /> That's almost all I can remember, but I think you can take it as a clue, and not see it. (Or if you see it, do not wait too long.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Really. If you want a Pokemon movie, rent "Pokemon, the first movie".
