When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've all been guilty of it at one time or another, but my excuse to see things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; Ignorant of what makes a show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, now I appreciate the good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. My 12-year-old son would love every little piece, every line of forced dialogue, every piece of unnecessary technobabble. Writing is more than insipid; so insipid and uninspired that makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me wait for the worst Trek show, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored in two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score and great science fiction ideas. With the exception of a little bit of the original music, nothing that made the movie fun was shown in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver visible and the legend interesting, seems to be almost asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like someone's basement. The cinematography is not much better, as vanilla and boring as the scripts. I'm surprised that the shows with much more style (like Farscape) and the substance (like the Battlestar Galactica reimagined) have smaller bases and less rabid than this pap. It just does not deserve it.
