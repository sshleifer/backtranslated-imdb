I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've seen! I ignored the comments posted on this site thinking that it would fall on my taste with horror, but I got bored and turned it off. Let's see: <br /> <br /> The costumes: consisted of cheap cameos costumes and Home Depot painters costumes. The masks were made from what appears to be aluminum foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I should give you that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: It was horrible! I did not care about the dubbing. I find this humorous as in "Premutos" by Ittenbach (great movie). The fight and the action sequences were very poor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not see any of the Schnaas movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same genre and theme. Check Premutos, Casa de sangre, Schramm and the nekromantiks.
