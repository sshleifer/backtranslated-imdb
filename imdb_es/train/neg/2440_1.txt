Koen Wouters is a flamenco singer and presenter. In the early nineties he also tried films. But this incredible scrap piece ended his acting career once and for all. She also finished the actress career of the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a soccer wife, television presenter and creator of programs. In fact, I saw him in a theater (almost empty) because he used to be a fan of the Koen Wouters band, Clouseau. I regret having spent money on it. It seems cheap, it is a terrible story and it is badly executed in all possible ways. Some people think it's so bad that it's fun. I am not one of them. I just found an incredible waste of time and money.
