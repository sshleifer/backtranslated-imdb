This movie is another one in my list of movies so as not to disturb. I saw him 40 years ago when he was a teenager, he stayed late to do it, he was very upset to discover that it was around 95% romance, 4% of everything else, 1% of history, if so. It's what I call a bait and movie change, one with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. This is a subject that deserves a good film treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The royal members of Lafayette Escadrille were not fleeing from the law nor were they products of abusive homes, in reality they were idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them come from a class higher than the character of Tab Hunter. The flight school is not for the smart alecks and everything that is known, an individual like the one described here would not have lasted two days, it would have been the palisade or the infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another version of Hollywierd of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
