This has to be the cheapest film made in the 21st century. It is of low quality, but in the end it falls below ... everything. All the cheap tricks, like flash and dark, are used to hide those fucking computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the protagonist Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene, where Anne is asked: "Why do you seem so careless?" The correct answer is because she can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid smile on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the movie, it's B-quality. It is also the description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel, Capital -vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, with a character called Fletcher and sea monsters
