Ok I love bad horror. I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of him. Demonicus, or House of the Dead, were bad enough to make fun of. Severed was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers: who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat throughout the movie, and I have a series of comments, both in the style "this It stinks "as in the realm of real criticism. <br /> <br /> Parcel (more or less) - There is a guy in this city (possibly Seattle, see below) who is running and cutting heads. He has been doing this for more than a year (I will not get the exact numbers again, thank you very much), possibly two or three years. One head per week. And the police are ONLY calling a "specialist" (who once refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes back). <br /> <br /> Schya! The feds take over after, THREE connected homicides? ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿They come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting heads to win enough power to become a body (and then presumably conquer the world, or possibly go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Configuration: where is this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you may not realize that at the bar / rave (occupied by approximately ten movie staff members and their families), there is a poster for a local radio station, and in the entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialog (as IF) between the two policemen (yes, those who cut their heads in about 15 minutes of the film) discuss "the new stadium", which may still have been a problem when this was made the movie. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize in the name of the film and I'm ashamed. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is where it gets really critical: being a horror movie. Writer (not published, do not look for my name in the IMDb), I investigate. A lot of research And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi, while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who keeps cemeteries and has traditionally been associated (by several Christian oppressors) with "Satan", is actually a similar liar to "Loki". God. <br /> <br /> In other words, it does not cut heads. <br /> <br /> In addition, an important part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wishes. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of several members of the congregation by the loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if you have already owned someone, why make a NEW body? <br /> <br /> Also, if Baron Samedi had a body, he would not be cutting heads, he would get some good rum, cigars and par-TAY !!! <br /> <br /> In short, the only thing they did The right thing (surprisingly) is that reading completely unnecessary Tarot cards (used only to show that the voodoo girl is "spooky") did not ruin the interpretations of the letters as most movies do. Once again, I have done the research. (Anyone remembers the old nightly announcement of the tarot phone readings: "Lovers: you will soon fall in love ..." And all that nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you did it like this Through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'll regret it more if you feel the need to watch the movie on my own, so do not do it.
