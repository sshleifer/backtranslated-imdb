This film, incredibly bad, is shown in Australia as "Hydrosphere", it is so bad that they hypnotize you and you have to see it until the end, just to see if it can get worse ... and it is! The plot is so predictable that it seems written by a high school theater class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than those of the miniatures, and the performance is made of wood. <br /> <br /> The infant 'muppet' seems to have been stolen from the accessory cabinet of 'Total Recall'. There did not seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I found that this movie was so bad that I laughed almost all the time. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should duck his head in shame. Obviously I needed the money!
