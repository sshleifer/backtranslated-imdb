"Why?" <br /> <br /> That simple question had to be on the lips of all New Yorkers during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. That same word will surely become the same disconcerting question 22 summers later as people leave the cinemas exhibiting the trite and exploitative "Sam's Summer". <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee tries to weave the story of a pack of misunderstood thugs looking for the famous psychopath, who paralyzed New York City for more than a year, with a graphic and clear depiction of the murders , the demons inside Berkowitz's head and the frustration of a useless pursuit by the NYPD. It presents a set of despicable losers who listen to their own "dogs barking" while living lives devoid of love, honor and humanity, they are no different from Berkowitz. Lee surprises the audience in almost every painting with "none of us is what it seems to be". Often, a critic of the white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing a newlywed with an unfaithful husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "on the back of a big black Cadillac. " An Italian mobster tells a black detective that Willie Mays's famous "over-the-back center field" was "lucky." Lee even makes sure to emit the racist reflections of a middle-aged black woman who declares: "I'm happy that a white man is killing all these white people because if it were a black man who killed all these white people, there would be more big". riots in the history of New York City. "<br /> <br /> In addition to an excellent opening photo of an arrival at a nightclub (reminiscent of the shots of" Goodfellas "by Martin Scorcese or" The Third Man "by Orson Welles), this film has no soul - Parade characters on the screen devoid of human decency Although we do not learn anything about the real victims of this dreadful revelry, Spike Lee seems to be saying that New York City got what it deserved during that dreadful and boiling summer more than two decades ago. <br /> <br /> "How could someone break it? What havoc in your beloved city? "How could someone show so much hatred toward their neighbor?" <br /> <br /> Are these questions appropriate for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
