Hollywood always had problems to reach an agreement with a "religious image". Strange Cargo is no exception. Although it uses the talents of an excellent cast, and it is produced on a high budget, with Robert Planck's photography in a good mood, the film fails on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements alters the viewer's participation in the action and the fate of the characters. It was difficult for me to stand still through all the metaphors devised, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept the conceited know-it-all of Ian Hunter bathed in light as a figure of Christ. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few of the Boston / Detroit / Providence filmmakers, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious from the breakthrough that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a "message picture." It fractured everywhere. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film has enjoyed a rebirth on television. A home-like atmosphere seems to make the allegory of the film more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Charge flows along predictable and very moralistic lines that will not make anyone guess how the main characters will eventually reach an agreement with the destination .
