Bonfires of the Vanities is a film soaked in sweat flop. I can not remember any movie that tried so hard to be so relentlessly scandalous, provocative and important, but it failed so consistently in all areas. It's like a standing comedian who does not laugh, but can not leave the stage. The harder the movie tries, the louder each attempt to laugh produces a thud. The desperation shown by the film is so dazzling that it almost arouses the compassion of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The film reaches the level of laughing out loud only twice. Once you see Geraldo Rivera playing a tabloid television journalist hateful, arrogant and loving, which is fun only because he apparently does not realize he is playing himself. The other scene worthy of laughter is the film's final "big moment", in which the judge played by Morgan Freeman gives a lecture on what morality is ("that's what your mom taught you!" ). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, one must admit that it is a noble endeavor. It has a good band of actors, although badly distributed, who try to make characters with thin cardboard cartoons. The film looks professional and the small film embellishments that director Brian DePalma loves are simply obvious, though not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never emerges above the level of cartoons. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even situation comedy takes time. But the best that bonfires can achieve is despair. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to get away.
