This seems like two films: one is a long, pretentious and sad saga about an actor who takes charge of the parts he plays; The other is a brilliant social commentary about a middle-aged divorce that is picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business apart. She drops heavy hints about the need for connections, her massage certificate and her desire to enter the modeling game. I love to glimpse his sordid floor with a kitchenette behind a curtain, and his daring crochet outfit with swollen sleeve and revealing navel. <br /> <br /> Do the actors get the Oscars for Shakespeare? We know that they are the Oscars for posing as disabled people, using many prostheses or pretending to be angry. The scenes of Shakespeare (which are activated and deactivated) are shameful and outdated. And so are the scenes of "going crazy" where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it quite clear in an early scene that it used to be a chorus. When he cites his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
