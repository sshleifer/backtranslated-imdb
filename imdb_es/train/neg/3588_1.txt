The follow-up to "Walking Tall," from 1973, continues the real-life drama surrounding Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment is presented as a television movie. Bo Svenson takes on the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but is too soft for the role; He comes out as a country-street singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film a star strictly for its good intentions, but the script is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 for "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 for the television movie "A Real American Hero".
