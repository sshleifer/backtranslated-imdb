I am required to write a review of this IMAX feature as a way to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY. Almost any episode of "The human animal" by Desmond Morris or "The nature of things" by David Suzuki could have exceeded the material presented. The director not only does not use the incredible IMAX 65mm to 70mm film material and the gigantic display screen, but everything on the screen is extremely impressive, given the accessibility of the aforementioned programming. The spectators are presented with a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and her niece and nephew. We follow them for forty and many endless minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes within the human digestive tract and we learn about the natural reflexes of babies' diving, do we really learn anything else? The majority of graduates from elementary school? Are we even remotely entertained by the ocean liner Heather? We care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX function, I suggest the beautiful photograph "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the "3D Space Station", technically exciting. Trust me.
