Where to start? What is the best way to describe how horrible this movie is? Let's start with the camper humor. It's not very funny Add a group of musicians posing as actors: Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Poor poor Art Carney, who should have known better than to make this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there is the plot. A roadie whose goal in life is to work on a Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose goal in life is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the movie should end, they can not find one last scene more plausible than one ... well, I will not ruin it is for you if you really want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are certain actors who inform you that this will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me, and has a more prominent role. That is a sure sign that the movie probably will not be very good. If nothing else, the film is up to the low expectations, even surpasses them by being worse than poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none is worse than Roadie.
