For starters, "Hobgoblins" tries to imitate the most successful "Gremlins". It's bad enough, but they do not even try to do anything that looks a lot like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything to keep in mind: shameful scenes, inappropriate sound effects, that act like a tapioca without flavor and a script that takes everything that humans consider sacred in their movies and throws them into the old tube. -aroo <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr ... Nosy kids crawl gremlin-like creatures from the movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. It sounds good, right? Well, do you see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right on it, maximum speed, face first. Look, THAT is cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quick, name something else, one of the drivers has been in something else than this. What other scripts have writers made from "Hobgoblins"? Name another effort by director Rick Sloane. How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have? Watch? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it took so long to write about such a horrible movie. I prefer to write about more important things; Like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" is and is bad: bad as the wallpaper of your grandparents, bad as the pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as the underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think that we will stop there. . <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight valiantly, but try as best they can, they can do a lot with "Hobgoblins" before they realize that, yes, the director MUST kick his shin. <br /> <br /> Real, very hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
