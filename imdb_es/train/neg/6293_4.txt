I had the pleasure of watching this movie from the beginning and I have to say that I thought it was going to be boring and I wondered how they could improve the 1984 version of Bachelor Party, starring Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good ... He was right ... Honestly, I thought it could have been better ... Of course there were some funny moments, but it seems that it did not affect me very much ... The performance was good and the story pretty well follows the original, but I think it could have been much better ... This movie, I would say it is for teenagers and young at heart; Full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical movie of the mill festival that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
