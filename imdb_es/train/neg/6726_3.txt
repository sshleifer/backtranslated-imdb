Anyone who has seen 'Shine', Scott Hicks' film of the harrowing and finally joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; Am I sure that I realize that 'The SOLOIST' is very poor in comparison? It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five pauses to answer emails just to wake me up). The representation of the area of ​​homeless people at the top and extremely self-indulgent, at the same time I fear with the horrible beach battle description in Joe Wrights another Attonment disaster. The performance of .J. Fox was an extremely bad example of performance and lacked credibility on the part of compensation.

However, the comparison of these well-known and known "STAR actors" is unnecessary, since the light that shines the brightest when it comes to acting must be that of Geoeffry Rush, of "shine", whose brilliant performance definitely SHONE It is much brighter in my sky. With 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins many more awards for empathy of the subject. Read the book and articles or wait until the DVD is soon in the basement of the offer.
