This movie was so predictable, that all the time you expect the obvious suspect to be innocent, and that there is still another important turnaround. However ... it is not like that. He just keeps acting scary, and she keeps ignoring him. Mary found very incriminating evidence in her house, and did she still trust him? And what was that "baiting the trap"? There was no cheating. She confronted him and he said: "Excuse me, I have to go kill someone". He left, and that was the end. They make attempts to use other suspects, (like that older carnival girl at the end) but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the scenario is simply strange ... who meets in a recycling factory? Its chopped and nothing is well developed. For example: when she leaves her place after drinking beer, he finds the pictures and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car ... what was that? His reactions were not portrayed. In the car she acted scared as if it had been practically a rape, but all we see is that she is taking a bath the next morning. booooooooo It could have been much better ... much better.
