Watching this movie made me think constantly; Why are you making a problem like that with some broken brakes? There are a million options to stop the car! In the movie Speed, the writers, at least, thought of a good reason why the car could not stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this movie; All the usual narrative clich√©s make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is a leak like a sieve, etc. That makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
