There is not a decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The boy who plays Sebastian sucks, too. He does not even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to make a trio): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat them? <br /> <br /> Lick. <br /> <br /> The ending contradicts the whole plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian loved Kathryn so much, apart from the fact that she was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl she could not have and that killed him". It was a joke that liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his desire. Then, in this P.O.S., it implies that he CAN have it, along with a girl in the side. What? And we do not even see sex, either. It is implicit, making it not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but also useless. <br /> <br /> And in the first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even though he won the bet, that ruined his chances. Then, in this excrement, he loses and falls in love. So she does not fuck the "losers", only the complete losers? Another thing: it's said that Sebastian has never been in love, so what's the name with Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, it suddenly reveals that the virgin girl is the evil lesbian lover of Kathryn. (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they enter a trio off the screen. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other contradictions of the plot. Did the writer even see the first movie? A child of 5 years can point out his things. <br /> <br /> After the trio, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting his innocent mind in the back of a limousine while Kathryn and Virgin Girl become malignant lesbians. Sudden Plot Twist sit in front, listen and smile maliciously at the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole that was in the first one, he could have made an interesting movie. I guess all it took for Sebastian to get it wrong was a trio with two hot girls. Interesting.
