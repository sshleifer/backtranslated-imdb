I wanted to see Dreamgirls for quite some time ... with all their criticisms, nominations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the movie was good! He really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie progressed, I and my whole family were bored. The singing kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more number of music and it would have been equaled with RENT. <br /> <br /> In addition, I almost did not notice any character development in any of the characters; I just did not care what happened to them! Even when the character of Eddie Murphy died of a drug overdose, he knew he should have been sad, but he could not feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background on singing in their childhood and other things, but there the personalities were not revealed enough to attract me. what accompanies the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were, in my opinion, wonderful movies). In general, I think this movie would be better suited to someone who does not really care about a story in general, but who will enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun songs.
