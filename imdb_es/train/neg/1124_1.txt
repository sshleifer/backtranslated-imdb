The first image was the best of this movie, because it gave you the hope that you were watching a passionate and well-crafted independent film. Damn that first opportunity to fill me with hope. As the "film" progressed slowly and laboriously, my thoughts were varied in relation to this "movie": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this "movie"? Did I get my validated ticket at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This would be the only exception I will make to see a movie at home in a movie theater, because at home you can turn it OFF. Was there any redemption value? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially with a dog collar. Apart from that, this "movie" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual elevator. He did not succeed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was very bad. His performance was the only comedy I found.
