This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming characteristic of this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever seen, I would have an adequate response. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed in 35 mm, so it's already sticky like hell. I would not have bothered to comment, but I noticed that some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me deny the myths and the lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in the movie. Everything screams moody. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I've ever seen. The fight scenes are incredibly amateur. Imagine a girl waving her arms around a circle helplessly and throwing weak kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director has just taken people out of the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have much budget for the movie but they have still made better movies with a smaller budget before. Unforgivable.
