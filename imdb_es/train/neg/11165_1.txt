I mean, really ... or suddenly I lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew it was not going to be a great movie, I just did not think it was going to be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the old days when you could find smart funny lines in any movie? When actors did not have to play ridiculous roles in an attempt to be fun? Now we find movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find the funny parts. <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of trash <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my English)
