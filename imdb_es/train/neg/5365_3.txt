"Private practice" is separating from the quite successful and well-written "Anatomy of Gray." The cast is fabulous. The premise could even work. But the writing is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> The previous pilot disguised as an episode of Gray's Anatomy should have been my first warning. The plot was simply blah. I thought maybe it was a coincidence. So I set up the DVR to record the pilot and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> While I was watching the pilot, I kept wondering how a show with such a good cast of actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to aspire to people and make them come back for more. There is supposed to be excitement, flash, good writing, intriguing story with a cliffhanger that must be answered for the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this program did not have any of that. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was a coincidence, I only saw the second episode hoping for the best. And although a little better, it does not come close to what should be interesting. Do not miss the television. <br /> <br /> I just deleted this program from my list of programs to see. It is not worth the effort of the IMO, and I would be very surprised if this program reaches the middle of the season. Pass this one up the people.
