Apparently, Hollywood is only delivering money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak. This movie was insensibly bad. The casting was terrible, the performance untold, and the story was filled with holes. Script? who needs a script I was surprised that the film was not as vulgar verbally as I thought it would be, however, I got enough shots of T & A to last a lifetime. The film was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so badly written, I thought that the two brothers in the movie were lovers at first. The scenes in the hippodrome, together with the main actress of the movie, made me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film that Grindhouse was inspired after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
