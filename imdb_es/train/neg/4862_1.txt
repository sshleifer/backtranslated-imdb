This show is one of the worst shows of ALL TIME! There are no original jokes and they always arrive a year late. as in 2009 they will finally say something about Michael Vick's dog fights. all the members of the cast are people who wanted to be in SNL but had to go to the lowest of the low, crazy television. It's an hour of crazy jokes from magazines that are not funny, told by the terrible John Stewart that bees want. So if you have a problem, tell me, I love hearing the opinion of the 3 people who see this program. The type of family expressed it well "Osama bin Ladin was hiding in the only place where nobody watched, the cast of crazy people on television, there is a reason why nobody sees the program.
