I saw this movie during the weekend and, as always I was impressed by the beauty and polish of the films produced by the Church, I was disappointed that it stayed so short, I did not inform the members and I left the researchers with many unanswered questions . <Br /> <br /> The movie is 70 minutes from vignettes of the life of Joseph Smith. It is not a true biographical film because there is no real coherent narrative. Most episodes refer to Joseph doing good deeds, playing baseball, running races and laughing with children, often in slow motion. What kind of good people, just that it was Joseph, huh? Look him out there beating rugs for his wife Emma. Well, how about the carpets of your 33 plural wives? No mention is made of polygamy. A flagrant omission. <br /> <br /> And it is in such omissions where the film fails. It provides very little information and leaves the members of the audience with critical thoughts that ask themselves WHY is Joseph being wrinkled and feathered? WHY do they throw him into jail and WHY that mob wants to kill him? The highlight of the film is, of course, the journey of Joseph and Hyrum to the Carthage prison (passing in front of the real United Nations of faces that look from the gates of Nauvoo). But there is never any mention of WHY. Nothing about the suppression of Smith from the Nauvoo Exhibitor newspaper and the request for his press destroyed for revealing the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience is left wondering or assuming it is a more unfounded persecution of the Church. It is not mentioned that Joseph was accused of treason for declaring martial law and calling the Nauvoo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect this film produced by the Church to present the recent biography of Joseph of Richard Bushman, Rough Stone Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised by how little the substance actually appeared. <br /> <br /> And worse, the substance that was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples leapt towards me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows José reading directly from the gold plates in his two-ring binder, which were actually hidden away from the site. It is well known that Joseph made his translation by burying his face in his hat, looking at the seer stone there. The second inaccuracy occurs in the prison of Cartago, where the mob assaults the cell. Church History reports that Joseph had six shots and even fired a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the signal of Masonic anguish (as reported in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Maybe showing that the reality of the shooting would have destroyed the mood the filmmakers had created, but by omitting it they were unfaithful to the story and could not show José what he really was like: skillful with a gun and able to defend itself. In fact, the impression given by the film is that Joseph was a good guy, but also a kind of milquetoast that everyone beat, threw in jail and finally murdered in cold blood. It was far from that; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who suffered many difficulties and struggled to bring to fruition what he believed in. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but know it's a cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes reading a copy of Bushman's biography of Smith, Rough Stone Rolling <br /> <br /> PS: The films produced by the Church have no credits, but experienced eyes can distinguish a couple of faces known. Rick Macy is excellent as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, loved as Thomas in Finding Faith in Christ, here he plays the evil Methodist minister who did not show Christian love to a young seeker of Truth.
