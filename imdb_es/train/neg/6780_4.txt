This film was a critical and box office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a play, which failed on Broadway. The story is about some naval officers who go on leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have 4 days of rest that they spend in the Mark Hopkins hotel. The movie snakes a lot and none of the characters seems very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama, but here he plays a kind of wheel salesman and really does not make it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better options. Audrey Hepburn was initially willing to play alongside Grant, but had other commitments, so Suzy Parker intervened. He had never acted before, but at that time he was the most important photographic model in the United States. I think he did a good job, considering all the pressure he was suffering. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes did not really work. The studio tried to give him some class acting with Grant, but the character did not have any substance.
