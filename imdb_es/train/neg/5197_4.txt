Weakest entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Fun jokes and usual pranks, but not much plot. Barrymore has something to do as an inspector, changing costumes to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a wild goose chase (mainly in circles, perhaps the budget was tighter than normal) to rescue poor Phyllis, who is captivated by people that I want to attract Drummond to his doom. For those who keep the account, in this case, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny disguised as fishermen to mingle at The Angler's Rest, but little rises above the foolish.
