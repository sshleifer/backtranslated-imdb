I admit that, being of age in the hippie-dippy era, I am an imbecile for this type of movie. I can enjoy some of the fans of the hippie genre much more than most "normal" people. However, this movie is simply horrible in every way possible. <br /> <br /> Every trite perception of hippie stupidity is presented as a gospel, the cops kill a young and long hair when a plane lands peacefully. This movie is so horrible that it's not even funny to see it as nonsense about the excesses of the hippie drone. It's like a left version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave him two stars was because there are some obscurities of interest in the soundtrack, besides, I could not find a selection of negative stars. <br /> <br /> Without actors, almost without argument, sheeze, just a script ... you already have it, an "artistic" movie ... All this done in the root channel sweeping channeling, dragging every scene without sense just to complete the time. <br /> <br /> In a strange twist of life imitating art, the "non-actor" movie star joined a real-life commune and stole a bank in Boston, one of his co-thieves He was killed and was sent to prison where he was killed in a weightlifting suspect "accident" ... and just think, he had to leave this as a legacy ... Oy vey.
