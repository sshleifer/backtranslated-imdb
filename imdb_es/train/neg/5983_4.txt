I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action / adventure movie if the writers could have figured out where to aim. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a game, but I did it. Do not expect me to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could have been visually stunning and exciting. I should have focused on more action / adventure and on the objective of the original series ... save people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were also chosen). Anyway young against the original). The main part was Lady Pen√©lope and Parker. I did not care too much about the original characters, but I thanked them in the movie. The program was stolen! <br /> <br /> I always liked Thunderbirds more for high technology than for stories, and even that did not have enough screen time as far as I was concerned. I would have liked to see more of the great gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a big boy ...;)
