This movie was different in that it did not show the typical gay stereotypes that I'm used to seeing. But that does not change the fact that it totally lacks a story. I'm sure there are many gay men who are happy to be represented on the screen, since gay black characters are rarely seen, and when they are, the characters are usually not fully developed. But how hard it would have been for the writer to actually write a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that was focused. There really does not seem to be a point in this movie, and although it's a low-budget movie, it's still no excuse for the lack of story or plot.
