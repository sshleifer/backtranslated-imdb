I can not see why the filmmakers remade this movie. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. In addition, the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring even though filming in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin imprisoned Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think there was no need to redo it, or if you decided to remake a classic, you must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
