This is one of the most atrocious rewrites I've seen. If you want to make a film with a bad story, you should refrain from giving it the title of a good book. There is hardly a relationship between Wolfe's book and this film apart from the title. I do not care about the changes if they help the story to flow on the screen. At least the changes should not damage the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. The actors are miserable. The director and / or the scriptwriter obviously could not decide whether to perform a boring comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this movie and you did not like it, try the book. If you have seen this movie and you liked it, read the book.
