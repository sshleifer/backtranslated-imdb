A typical Italian film from the 70s, original and good music, but with some peculiarities, an interesting but not fantastic photograph, a poor and sometimes confusing plot (for example, the role of the wolfhound and where the child comes from) ). with a poor dialogue, a pleasant atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) known and sought after is probably because of the nude scenes (including the typical pseudo-coitus of the 70s) that involve a girl of 11 and 13 years old with an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel): it is interesting from a sociopolitical point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the United States) 30 years ago, whereas now it is more than a taboo <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of a girl (Laura) of the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of an aspect of adolescent life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve until the end of the film and already appears well versed in the erotic arts: there is no "coming of age" for her: she is a very vain girl who already knows. her sexual charms, but in the end she only uses and ends the film crying like the girl she really is still. The boy is an absolutely despicable bully, while Laura is presented as a very naive and weak victim.
