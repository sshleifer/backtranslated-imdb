You can not say that this movie is bad, since, unfortunately, it is painfully mediocre. Lacking real ingenuity or imagination, a thin weave stretches to the absolute limit and the "jokes" (which are predictable and threadbare) extend to such a disproportionate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer. Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what "surprised" us or diverted us 30 years ago does not work the same way now. We have seen everything before, and it does not break any taboo because they have evaporated a long time ago. A great fault.
