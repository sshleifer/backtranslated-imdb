First of all, I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hoped that this movie was fine. He had many opportunities, with a great cast, such as Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And besides everything, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was stupefied. Much of the horror of the book was lost, as Bradbury must have been forced to keep violence to a minimum. All the images in the book ... disappeared. Everything that made you writhe ... it's gone. <br /> <br /> And then there's the performance. Like many of the films that Disney released in the 1980s, children in this film can not act. And, this bothered me a lot, none of them looked like 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were known. <br /> <br /> You would think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could achieve this in their roles as Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is as if they did not care. All they want to do is pay a mortgage or something. This is far from being some of his best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the Dust Witch character was not right. She is much less evil and does not have the presence as she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything that is left out of the book. The search for the night of the dance, the mark of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the carousel, the fate of the rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. On the one hand, the merry-go-round of the fatality with the superimposed horses circling was not really creepy, and that strange green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on talking about how this movie destroyed the original novel, but it boils the blood. I do not see this movie but read the book. It's a Bradbury classic.
