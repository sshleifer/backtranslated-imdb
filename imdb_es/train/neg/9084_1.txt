This was the worst movie I've seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act at all! she did not have any emotion, it was all blah, blah, blah, like she was reading a boring textbook. The smart kid and the boy who loves food (the names were not worth remembering) were so annoying that they drove me crazy. When it was spoken, it was something scientific or food. Molly's father did not show enough emotion for his daughter's lack. The police officer and Molly's father said the same thing four times. It was just horrible Everything was repeated a lot. Beatrice should have been through something bad for being so bad. I just lost a moment in my life to see this movie!
