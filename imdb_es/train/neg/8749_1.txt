A terrible movie as everyone has said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy, who gave a prize to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So, were they foolish enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? <br /> <br /> I do not see a public record of SUN participation, but clearly the creators of this film know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery
