OK, I have this DVD, I have it new on Amazon ... I mean, I think it's rough and a pretty cool movie and Melissa Bale, the bitch / bitch they pick up is really hallucinating ..., the performance sucks and everything. Polt simply sucks the clown is a huge guy who wears a mask and is disgusting, but it's okay, I would not recommend it if you wanted to rent a good entertainment movie after a hard day's work, but if you have nothing else to do and are Obsessed With these stupid films like me, I see them once, and I do not know how the artisan DVD has SICK. in his DVD collection, s.i.c.k. It's not good enough to be owned by a half decent movie company, it's fine, that's all.
