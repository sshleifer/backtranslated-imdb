This was on the DVD of the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not in this. Nowhere did I see the name of Mel Brook here and I can guess why, it makes much more sense not to be associated with this pilot. My gawd, to whom I would find this funny. Of course there may be a race problem, but for me it just was not funny, well because it's just not funny. It's as if writers do not even try to be funny, just to take advantage of being tied up with Blazing Saddles. Did you expect this show to be for several seasons when you did this pilot? Broadly speaking, they did not care. It was a fast cash cow that, thank God, it did not withdraw. I guess it's useful only for historical purposes, or just to show how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be.
