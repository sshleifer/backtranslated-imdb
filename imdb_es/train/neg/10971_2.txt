How Irish critics rave about this movie surpasses me. Surpassed by the usual band of Irish actors, it crawled out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with peculiarities of forced character (the brown sauce). Romanticizing everything that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump, but it sure is not the same.' A lot of treats purely for the American public (the boss of the supermarket and his horribly forced phrase). And the nail in the coffin was the character of Colm Meaney. A great actor forced to interpret this part that could have been written by a child of five years. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you have to say that. Well, at least he was not putting on his terrible American accent. International audiences are warned: stay at home and see Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. The intermediate is an exterior walk.
