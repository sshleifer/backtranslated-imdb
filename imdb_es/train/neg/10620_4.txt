Despite having some exciting (and audacious) sequences, the NBTN never gets going. There are boats that explode, assassinations of tweezers, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all kinds of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they are interspersed with long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to this the British characters "too appropriate" and you feel that you have gotten into a Holmes Sherlock Film. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very common. There are many opportunities to get beautiful shots of the field, or complex shots of someone being dragged into a big bonfire, but all this is unimaginative and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for the fans of Lee and Cushing.
