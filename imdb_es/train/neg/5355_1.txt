Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see why he should spend money on a movie he could shoot with his father's video camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a MOVIE, not many people who think it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this movie because the guy from the video store said it was great, and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, it has the dumbest plot of all, the most unreal characters of all and the truth, the truth, the worst DEMONSTRATION in the history of movies. Even Tom Savini can not save this. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
