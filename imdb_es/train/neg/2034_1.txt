Really, very bad. How do you make such a bad movie? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, an interesting camera work or at least some free nudity, but I did not get anything. I had just seen Cabin Fever and thought it was a train crash (except for nudity and Pancakes) but it seems a genius compared to this dreck. The best screenwriting doctor in the world could not have saved this putrid pile of stinking poop. <br /> <br /> The only thing that applies to this "movie" is that it ended. My head hurts just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad that I only paid $ 5 for it and will soon end up in a landfill.
