Nobody could like this movie for its merit, but if you have a sense of humor and you enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It is located up there with "Road House" for its characters, sets and absurd story lines. The bad writing really resented me: "I want you to dust off those guys" instead of "... Destroy those guys". The F-14 take off from the carrier but, when they enter formation, they are F-16! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal returns to work for the general who, just a few minutes before, was supervising a covert "mental cleansing" in Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards. So, naturally, all the guards lower their weapons and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a failure but it explodes anyway. The little furtive fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal takes him back to California, the longest road, that is, across Europe, even though there is an airline that gives him 20 minutes of air support in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black computers, 2 flat screen televisions and images of meters and maps on the walls. What a flash!
