Let me be clear. I have used IMDb for years. But only today I had the trouble of registering on the site, just to be able to give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some horrible. However, I have never seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of great intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is chosen as the princess, but completely amazing as Phocion, a child. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is even worse, than in the insipid French work that is the source (Marivaux never came to Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way). <Br /> <br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant and passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown chemicals frantically poured from one beaker to another, screaming the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even more foolish. For this, the couple should receive a joint prize 'Clair Danes', which in a fair world would be granted by the anachronistic and uninspired free reinterpretation of interesting teenagers from literature like brats from the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables ). <br /> <br /> Apart from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the film. For example, there are times when a handful of spectators fade in and out of sight, sitting on chairs, looking at the main characters. The director wants us to realize that he has adapted a work. I get it. But it does not happen at all until very far in the movie. At that moment, seeing a crowd of people sitting on chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They are like a kind of zombie crowd without fear, appearing through the mists, filling us with fear. When you see the party and the horrible song that ends this movie, you'll want to wake up your own zombie crowd and kill them all for the serious injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
