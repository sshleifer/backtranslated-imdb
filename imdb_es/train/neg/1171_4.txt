I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and misplaced film is of a filmmaker whose other works I have enjoyed enough. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word that is not "enduring" will do), left me in a vile state of mind, a condition that was only alleviated by reading the comment of the IMDb user of ali-112 . Rohmer has not only tried (successfully) to make us see the world through the generic art of eighteenth-century France, but, as Ali has pointed out, has demonstrated (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of the consciousness of class and the revolution that inspired through the eyes of an unfortunately elitist woman of her time. The director has achieved something undeniably difficult, but I wonder if it was worth the effort he took to do it, or to see the boring results of his work.
