I love horror movies, low budget, 50, 60, 70, 80, but how can anyone think that this is a very good horror movie? Compare it to the titles of similar movies in houses surrounded by veins. The unsettling, the changing, the brilliant. or for a similar horror movie based on technology that was better FAAAR, (though still far from excellent) Demon Seed. Okay, I'll be fair ... compare it to horror movies made for television! do not go to sleep ... spooky and better done. The Salem lot, the night stalker, the night gallery, even not entering the basement or the Crowhaven farm were much better. * SPOILERS * first, because a scene as good as the bloody scene of the shower was, you have a scene like the opening scene ... oh boy! The garden hose comes alive to water some playful teenagers! TERRIBLE. Also, just what we understand about the house ... it seems that you need to use your video cameras to see what is happening, and it is a very emotional house. It is not a spirit, or demon, or entity, it is a house that is "possessed", but why? Do they lead us to believe an inanimate object learned to love Suzie / Margaret, our protagonist? Now that I'm on the subject of Suzie ... another scene that totally annoyed me, this poor, crazy lady is coming, she tells you she was your nurse, who unburdens herself, falls into the boiling pool, fighting in agony for 45 seconds, and What does margaret do? Do you risk having your hands burned to save this poor old woman who came there to warn her of life? No, she stays there and looks! The performance for the most part was better than the average for a horror movie, but that's where the positive aspects end. at least for a more interesting and funny horror film about an inanimate object that kills people who look at the deathbed: the bed they eat. I have the feeling that the people who rated him so much have not seen him since it was originally broadcast, or remembered him as scared of children. This movie was far less meritorious.
