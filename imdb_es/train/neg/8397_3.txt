After reading the previous comments, I'm glad I was not the only person who got confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine appears twice walking to a grave and closing the lid after him. I waited anxiously for some kind of explanation for this strange behavior ... naturally I assumed it had something to do with the mistreatment in the house, but since he was killed by the first rising corpse (hereinafter referred to as Zombie # 1), these Scenes do not make any sense. Please, if anyone knows why Carradine kept going up to the graves, let the rest of us get involved! <br /> <br /> All the action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try a synopsis. John Carradine goes to the cemetery to investigate and is strangled by Zombie # 1. So far so good. But then we have the confusing scene in which John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, in search of a small film in the light of the moon in the cemetery, discover the body of Carradine. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from where Zombie # 1 had emerged, but instead, Ireland manages to throw it into the open grave, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead from the beginning (a witch?), But it's never explained why he changed from a normal appearance to a rotten meat version when flying to the grave of Zombie # 1. (Considering what unbearably slow these zombies are, I thought I would have preferred to remain in their "normal" form until their business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to the mind: who the hell is Zombie # 1? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the opening credits of the film, but who knows what, or why he has a particular grudge against the film crew. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and flees, we see the EXACT SAME PHOTO of Zombie # 2 dragging the trees as we saw for Zombie # 1. (This leads to a momentary confusion over how much quantity of zombies there are actually). Then, in the best horror film of 1950, Ireland manages to escape while running away. Conveniently, he bangs his head against the small tombstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (was not John Carradine so kind to chisel a tombstone for a cat he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 It has been causing havoc in the house. He easily dispatches three members of the film crew, then begins to climb the stairs. Faith Domergue hears it, and thinking that her lover John Ireland is back from her night session, it goes off. Seeing that she is only Zombie # 1, she lets out a scream and retires to a room where she retrieves the Irish revolver. While the star Carole Wells is taking a shower at this moment and can not hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who is drinking and playing in a mirror in her room) does. Taking his sweet moment (and only after a few more shots of his hip-flask) finally decides to investigate. (One thing that surprises the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are the screams and the shots). Domergue returns to the corridor armed and ready, but confuses Macauley with Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He makes a good acrobatic turn on the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs down, right in the waiting arms of Zombie # 1. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is already out of her shower and is drying up when she hears shots and the screams of Domergue; she does not feel great urgency in going out to investigate either. So during this time, Zombie # 1 has time to tie Domergue from the neck with a rope. Wells sees the corpse hanging from Domergue and faints. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???), but more about that later. Meanwhile, Ireland has recovered its senses and stumbles into the house where it discovers the bloody butchery of Zombie # 1. Although Ireland has just tripped 3 people killed, it worries her more that her film has been exposed and ruined! Fortunately for him (and the public), Zombie # 1 throws some film equipment over his head from the second floor. That's the last we see of Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience receives a montage of all the deaths, which shows that the new ones "reflect" the old ones. So deep. <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2, meanwhile, has approached the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January), where by chance he sees Carole Wells floating in a stream, and Fish her out. How do I get there? Zombie # 1 took it, threw it and then went back up the stairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims drowned in the bathtub, so Wells also has to drown (but never explained why out in a stream, instead of in the bathtub). Zombie # 2 never comes to the house (everyone is already dead, anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1) but instead, takes Carol Wells back to the cemetery. While the final credits appear on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending to the open grave. <br /> <br /> The viewer is left thinking: Yes, but was not this Zombie The tomb of # 1? Why is Zombie # 2 taking residency? What if Zombie # 1 appears and wants to climb again? Zombie # 2 will leave it or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share the grave and the recently deceased Carole Wells? And what about John Carradine now dead? Where will he stay? After all, from the previous scenes, we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this synopsis of the end plot has confused you, do not worry because you are not alone.
