This must have been a shame for all the members of the all-African-American cast. Each derogatory and derogatory stereotype of the African-American community stands out prominently. I will not reinforce the insults by listing them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons and dice. <br /> <br /> A good song by Ethel Waters (and a couple of bad ones), and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of Sammy Davis, 8, raise the total to something below 1 in the IMDb scale.
