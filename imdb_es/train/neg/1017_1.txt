Oh my goodness. This was horrible. There is bad, then there was this. This movie does not make any sense at all. He runs around the map and is not clear about what he says. The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city, takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, seeing this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why did not a real city do it? The only writing that was decent was "Tilman" in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not exaggerated and campaigning. Actually, it was a shame to see John Heard play such a bad guy with a lot of screen time, and that the movie is a failure. Too. Hopefully, someone important will see it and, at least, give John Heard credit when he deserves it, and hire him again as a bad leader, which is where he should be. in list A.
