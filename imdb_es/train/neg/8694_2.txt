The female lead was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She was smiling too when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect her. I would have been inconsolable in the same situation. It seemed very quiet for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the role better. And I would have made a lot more money for such a controversial and important issue. All the others were excellent. I do not know where the main actress is, but I hope she has received some acting lessons.
