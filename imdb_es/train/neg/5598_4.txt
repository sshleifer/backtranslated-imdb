I saw him at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my good judgment, I liked it, but I thought that performance was a bit ... weak (I mostly noticed this in the teenage boy's family). I mean, to begin with, the script was not stellar, but the actors did not make me believe the relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> I do not know, I liked it. The characters are nice, and the plot is not challenging or annoying. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I do not consider it as fifty minutes badly spent. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
