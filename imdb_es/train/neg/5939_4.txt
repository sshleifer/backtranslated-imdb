I thought the movie was fine, but very disappointed that they did not capture the true image of his life. I was so anxious to see his mother as a real Jamaican, which is driving me crazy. The mere fact of watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. I completely lost interest in a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biographical story about Mark Anthony and having Arnold play the role. I do not know what the writer thought when he lost a valuable piece of film that I am sure that his mother played a very important role in his life. I'm going to say that the movie was fine, in addition to the great Fla !!!!!!
