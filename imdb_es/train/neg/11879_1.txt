My wife and I rented this movie because some people had established parallels between this and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as a "also recommended" selection if you liked "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Ingenious, comedic and with characters that remind me of the people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space", since both are movies. That's where the similarity ends. We probably sit in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving him the benefit of the doubt, hoping, not, * praying * to improve. He did not. We could not take it anymore, and we stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rental. They would have regretted if we had paid for it. We must be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we did not see the end, it may miraculously come together and redeem itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The Haiku tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe that it ever happened. The movie is so funny that it's painful. Just send the mail letters now !!! The premise is asinin. The jokes are horrible. We got as far as the "printer does not work" scene and we had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This movie is a PACKAGE for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Space ...... do not waste time with this turd. 0/10
