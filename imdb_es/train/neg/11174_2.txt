Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Did you read Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watery. I left everything to watch this movie on Cable. 30 minutes when I was having trouble staying awake. 60 minutes passed and I pressed the record button and fell asleep. I finished watching him the next morning. I should not have bothered. What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day in the Life ..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Horrible dialogue Non-existent continuity The camera work could have been done with a Super 8 handheld and it looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
