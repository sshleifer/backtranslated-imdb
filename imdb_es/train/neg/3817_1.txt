Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot- A family without a mother and 3 "dads" raise 3 girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters: Neat freak Danny, Joey, caricature lover, Jesse obsessed with hair, Michelle spoiled, stupid DJ and Stephanie almost normal. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, is not it? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not think anyone should see this program. I just laughed for a few moments throughout the program's career, and I think that instead of a lethal injection, all the criminals should be forced to watch this program, a torture much worse than anything else. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
