Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter ego in the whole city and it really starts to be a pain in the ass. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents an apartment to a hacker writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels it is her responsibility to take out 'the real Drew' from His stupor, so he does everything he can to help, even seduce her as soon as he has some free time. It's not very interesting, and much less scary, but Drew is sexy as always, especially when he gives the finger to a group of rude construction workers ... Yes, Drew, that's great! <br /> <br /> The best scene could be where Drew stabs his real-life mom, Jaid, with a large kitchen knife ... mmm ... and how was your day?
