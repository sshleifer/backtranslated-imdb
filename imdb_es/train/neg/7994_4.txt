Quite worthless for a television movie that follows the script of killer insects. The ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. I think it's from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen falls directly into the bed of ants. There is a lack of suspense in this movie and it is not scary either. Seeing a lot of ants bite their victims is not very scary. <br /> <br /> Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is almost incredible. It tells the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It has to be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys the huge ant colony. This bothers the millions of ants and traps people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End of the spoilers In general, this movie is extremely scarce. I do not understand why a DVD was released when so many movies that deserve it do not have it. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers appears in the movie. This is a movie to avoid.
