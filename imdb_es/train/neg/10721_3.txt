An expedition led by Hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to a previous expedition. They meet the beautiful and mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. Soon they meet a blood-drinking mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what is happening. <br /> <br /> A true snoozer. I caught this on the television of the night when I was about 10 years old. Put me to sleep! When I see him again all these years later, I can see why. It's slow, the mummy does not even appear up to 40 minutes (and only lasts 66 minutes!), The performance varies from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to be found. This film concentrates more on second-class drama (involving a silly love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> This qualifies three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone interprets it correctly, there's a good performance by Diane Brewster. It's short and the mummy's attack scenes (all three) are not bad. They are not scary just a little scary. Still, this movie is pretty bad. A safe cure for insomnia.
