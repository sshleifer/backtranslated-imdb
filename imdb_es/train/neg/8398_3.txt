The horror films of the 70s of Schlocky ... you have to love them. In contrast to today's boring slasher movies, these K-tel special offers really do something terrifying and do not resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about making a B movie ... it was horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island of the Earth) plays a queen of the movie B on the hill that makes a film about a series of grisly murders that happened to a family in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on the spot and on a very tight schedule. The co-star of the Ken doll discovers a book of Tibetan songs that work on the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without him. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, since he long ago stopped looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now reveals a humble existence as a caretaker of real estate. He deals with his daily work, but always seems to be in conflict with the director. <br /> <br /> The horror increases slowly; A dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes, seven murders. (At least there is truth in advertising). It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that a movie about him was being made. How was the bad faith to know that those damned Tibetan chants will really work? Face it, you can not walk around in Satan's coat and wait for him to lie down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says he performs an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.
