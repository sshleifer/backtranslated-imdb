Despite the high ratings given to this film by IMDB users, this is nothing more than his typical film of a girl with bad childhood, obsessive, harassed, married. The brief scenes of nudity of the attractive Justine Priestly may attract the voyeurs, but the movie is a trite madness. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
