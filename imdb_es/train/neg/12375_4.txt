The good thing about this is at least new: almost no film about dance music and the club scene (if it was made at all) comes to the theaters. And it radiates a lot of energy too, from the music to the representation of Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that you can not decide what you want to be. Although he definitely likes to be a fake documentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap, the manufacturers also realized that they would not want to play as imitators. However, it largely fails in the jokes because it is not very well written and most of the characters are underdeveloped. And it has no arc in its script and the address to reach 90 minutes, so why not edit it up to 75? The production department and the cinematography are still trying to save the day (eg, Paul's house). <br /> <br /> In a strange and unexpected way, everything disappeared. Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the Almost Famous line. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer a certain power of acting. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: it's a disaster, somehow it entertains a basic level, but it's better to spend a night at your favorite club.
