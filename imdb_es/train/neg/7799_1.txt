What happened here in the name of God? How do you create what is practically a cheap imitation of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 supposed to entertain someone ... someone, or even make a profit in dollars? But above all, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in bloody films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of them contain profanity. in the titles. In the gore department, this is not very different from the rest. Although, the level of ineptitude ... well, touching. <br /> <br /> The Extreme Pestilence of Zombie '90 is as bad as Peter Jackson's Living Life is bloody, think again. <br /> <br /> Being too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to return and eat the living. The concept has never been treated that way. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Only a Z-grade nightmare I can not say whether or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow I doubt that the English dub was very true to the original script, but weird things have happened. All this reminds me of a video introduction of a Troma movie, except that it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I've only seen one movie that was worse than this, The Chooper. <br /> <br /> As proof that Andreas Schnaas is a true director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you have no standards in what you're looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence, but you've been warned. Steel nerves are needed so that it can be completely crossed. But if Gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to bear this. Apart from that, there is no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but above all, there is no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 5/7/09: After a few more visits from Zombie '90, I changed my mind or I guess I just received it. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so do not forget the harsh words. Although, the Extreme Pestilence only deserves a star.
