The full title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". That is a race that nobody can win, but you can certainly reduce your margin of loss by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" in these bakvaas. This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. It forced my credulity too far. He was ridiculously stupid in his story and deserves to be mocked for it. <br /> <br /> It's not as horrible as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, meaningless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another unpleasant example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many "family" BW movies. If my father, who raised me and whom I love very much, would treat me like Big B did to Akshay, I would shoot him myself. Not to mention the trivialization of terminal illness.
