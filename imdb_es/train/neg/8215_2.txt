Actually I felt bad for the actors in this thing. No doubt, a high school theater class could do a better job or at least a job. The actors must have thought that this would be their great opportunity to work on a film, certainly it was not. In addition to the terrible performance, the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. The one on the remote control did not make any sense. For bad cause, I had the best premise of the group. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of supporting low-budget films and giving a fair chance to the new filmmakers, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I only saw it for some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people related to the movie. You can trick people into seeing this, but you can not trick them into liking what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the story of the boxer tried to be touching. Of course he failed miserably, but he tried. I save 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this trickle. I wish I had.
