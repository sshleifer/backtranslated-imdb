It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say that, but anyone who has enough experience to read this can probably solve every plot by turning from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I liked. I did not hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence, but everything felt too predictable on its way to the required happy ending. There were some funny bits on the way to be sure, but few were original. At least it was not by the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are, in reality, the only redeeming feature. All the others are a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done this as a favor for someone. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
