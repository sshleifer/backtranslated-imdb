This is one of those movies that make you think: Hulk "The real American" Hogan would have done the same? Frankly I do not believe it and I would have been right. I'm Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have rowed for another team (French, for example), simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the protagonist does not fall in love with the desire of a British girl at the end of the film, but of a compatriot, why row against Yale? When it comes to acting, well, all the players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the "society of dead poets." In fact that is another movie that I hate.
