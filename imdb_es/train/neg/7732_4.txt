Before writing this review, I went back and reread the criticisms of others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me, as it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, who has an often amazing score of Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "Thomas Crowne Affair "). The dance was forced, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgettable, the story a joke. Even the costumes were not particularly flattering. Only the photograph correctly captured the right spirit and spirit. I'm glad that other people have enjoyed "The Young Girls of Rochefort", although I certainly did not.
