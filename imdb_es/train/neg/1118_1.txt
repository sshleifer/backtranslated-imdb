I was really horrified by this spooky movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a spooky score. Really promising! In fact, after ten minutes you really start to sweat and you feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare, and what is worse, everything comes to light. For an hour and a half I tried to fight total boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a really horrible image: for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and, above all, your wallet, since the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie ticket for this amateur video is the biggest horror of all.
