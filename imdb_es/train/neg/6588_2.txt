The following are some of the most serious problems with this movie: 1) Clichés abound. Seriously, the terrible "turns" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps in time, which would be fine if done well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Secondary characters. that does not develop so much as to remain completely static or change drastically for no reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Large: HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE. On top of almost all people. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the best points of the film: 1) The protagonist is very handsome. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who would participate in this film: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes of calluses simply because the protagonist is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think to themselves "I like Hollywood, full of clichés and overacting, but if I could only see it in Korean ..." There's a lot of good Korean cinema out there, Why waste your time with garbage?
