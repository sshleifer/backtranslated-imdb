Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite 80s cartoon. I enjoyed both the first and second season of the series and the 1992 Christmas special "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas." Some fans of Gadget are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the program, but must compare it with the 2002 DiC release of "The last case of Inspector Gadget: Revenge of the claw," because they will find that the second season is gold absolute. . <br /> <br /> Being a fan of gadgets, I could not resist the opportunity to see the animated Gadget inspector on something that was not related to Gadget Boy. I bought the movie and I swore I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series. I was not even ready for what I was about to see. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a fragment of the original program still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some of the cons for this movie: * Humor does not exist in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (who originally had an almost equal part in the series as Gadget) have been missing the action for fifteen years at twenty-minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is below average. (He understood that Saban now has his own production company, but at least the "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets that made the show so appealing , like the gadget. -controller, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (which actually was used but was not even called the same thing), as well as its other standard gadgets for hats and hands. In this film, the legs of their devices were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of thing annoys the true fans of the program, and they simply are not necessary to change them. <br /> <br /> * The gadgetmobile of the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly "modern" convertible. All fans of the original series enjoyed the transformation of gadgetmobile in the gadget van and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The boss Quimby is now very bad tempered and even bad for Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Is there anything positive in this movie? ? Well, here goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to a real villain in the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (the classic villain "Gadget" of the second season, voiced by Louis Nye) . <br /> <br /> Are you looking for more redemption factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living according to those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose, even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: keep the original formula! "If it is not broke, do not fix it". The true fans of gadgets should avoid this movie; You will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> With luck, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1," which contains the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of gadgets, lover of the animation of the 80s and many of the programs of DiC, I recommend that the viewer buy the DVDs "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas", They are excellent and they will surely bring back good memories.
