This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of background story. However, everything else stinks. The director, Emmanuel, is quite incompetent in the cinema. Use some of the most idiotic shots in history. <br /> <br />: a pair of random sequences of random images scattered throughout the film. I do not know if he tried to be profound, intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer in which the main character lived, random buildings, random shots of buildings, random cat that moves away. WTF? And the clouds Many dark and dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - He really liked this technique of having a scene divided into different shots instead of just a continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his grass and the camera surrounds him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it in like 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and smart! Stupid. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, but it is what makes the movie so fun. And the scarecrow is a gymnast because it turns, turns and rotates all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long and well-built death, but no. A simple ear of corn on the ear. The love interest was hot. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets a 2.
