I'm not familiar with the trilogy but I found this movie last night on Showtime. The film looked very well made with the design of the set and the cinematography, but the script was forced and made of wood. The acting was pretty bad, I thought the two females were useful. Although you never really believed anything the secondary actors said. There were the stereotypes: the reverend reverend of the Bible without a nuance, the authoritative captain, the hot headed soldier, etc. I regret to say that, based on these deficiencies, I immediately registered as a Canadian without knowing it. The final credits of Telefilm Canada gave it away. I know I'm a horrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at first, but hostility towards girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy mistreating two young women for no reason. Focus on people. There's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls that if these girls are lesbians or not, that's just my inference from the hostility directed towards them. If you can aim and fire a weapon, you could also be nice to them. The question of his "immortal soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I think this is related to the rest of the trilogy, are these girls supposed to be the protagonists? One of them killed the Indian guy at the end who saved one of their lives. I suppose that one is only a victim of his condition, to whom one can not necessarily blame for his actions, but the other is only a murderer who does not deserve his happy ending.
