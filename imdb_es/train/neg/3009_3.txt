That song is still buzzing in my head. It's not the best song, but it's from the 80's. This film is about a lead singer who "supposedly" dies while being accused of murders while stalking his girlfriend who sings backup voices in his band. The lead singer whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, right) died after two years and his band returns for a concert, only that the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time. Billy stalks her and eventually walks around killing all these people and terrorizing the girl and making people around her think there is something wrong with her and that is imagining things. She finally decides to go to a cemetery and unearth her grave to see if he is still there. She sees that he is dead but still sees and hears her voice. During the end of the film we discovered the reason behind all this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to answer him and blame his brother and then he takes his girlfriend and terrifies her because she called him crazy. The ending is very happy and the performance is very boring and wooden. But ... I like it anyway. I see it for the song. I wish I had it.
