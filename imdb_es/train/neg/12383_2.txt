While some performances were good (Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian brides come to mind), the story was unconvincing and derivative, the emphasis on the racial origin of the bride was handled clumsily at best , and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes. Not as real people. I found myself making an uncomfortable grimace in many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can barely understand why the local newspaper here in San Francisco said this was a good movie, and I wonder who posted the review here on IMDb. Very disappointed with this movie, and actually I went to a theater to see it, due to the defective connection with Garden State, which is a much funnier, more inventive and moving film than this one. I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by the numbers that I almost left it, and some in the audience really did. THAT was followed by a silly climax in the cemetery, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being cheated to spend my money so uselessly.
