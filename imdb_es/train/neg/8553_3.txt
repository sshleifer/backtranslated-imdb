This is actually a pretty bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in the films that Collins made later. However, my main doubts about the film are that it is unlikely and frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS man who joins terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and he can not help but wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who then become quite clueless) get angry. The film begins with a rather powerful scene, but then snakes for a long time building towards the grand finale. In general, I think Whoever dares to win could have been an interesting 45 minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not include a movie. Although it had a reasonable success at the time when this film began the disappearance of the career of Collins, who in the eighties did mainly cheap and dubious films of soldiers of the fortune or the army. It's a pity, because he's actually quite a versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that is still successful.
