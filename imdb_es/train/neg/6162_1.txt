"Smokey and the bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but nobody wanted it to be. It was slapstick lowdown, but I had brains. He had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun summary. People left the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not provide any of this. There is no reason to smile. If it's supposed to be a tribute to Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them look terribly lazy by offering only poorly choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps I've seen. Everything seems false, badly filmed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (like the retreating girlfriend) is assigned her weakest role, without a single graceful or intelligent line ("If you do that jump, I will not be here when you get back"). Burt Reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking, but the joke is for any audience that feels through "Hooper." * since ****
