When Rodney Dangerfield is on a good run, it's very funny. In My 5 Wives, he is not on a roll. The synchronization of the sentences of a single line is deactivated, but they are the best for the movie. The five women who play the wives do not add a complete actress among them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is quite weak; There are some jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the movie could be played in the same way, even if the character of Rodney had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an older man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy. The fantasy of another elder: we're supposed to accept that Rodney's character is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling his role just to do a friend a favor, and the rest of the name the actors simply must be desperate to work. <br /> <br /> The odd winks at political correctness later in the film really do nothing for the movie. For those who like their politically correct films, the non-PC related humor is still there in the first place, and the apparent apologies for that still do not understand the point. For those who hate to see a movie yield to political correctness, PC add-ons are just annoying digressions. <br /> <br /> This must be the smoothest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some spicy jokes, and the scenes in the bedroom would have made shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's it. Maybe it was the topless men (joking). <br /> <br /> The DVD features interviews where cast members seem to find depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or joking. They seem serious, but I kept thinking: "You must be kidding!" There is also a peculiar disclaimer that suggests that, since the film never names Mormons or the Church of Latter-day Saints, it is not about them in any way. It does not matter if the film shows a polygamous religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In summary, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping that Rodney would go out and shoot, but the best I can say about the movie is that Rodney looked pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.
