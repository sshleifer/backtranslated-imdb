Many things are clarified when watching this movie: 1) the performance is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are more or less, but the conflict between parents and children skirts the telenovela. The other two boys: a child prodigy excessively pout and your stereotyped I am a girl, but I am very sensitive inside the Dreamboat Rubio; 2) The movie as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (played by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of initial love ballads is a strange choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) the strange lines and the lateral diagrams do not improve because of the terrible performance; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed, and probably disturbed.
