Looked at Hulu (too many commercials!) So he broke the rhythm, but still, it was like watching a really bad friends movie of the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were an Indian, I would protest the representation of all men as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for music videos from Western sales and used many Western models for men to play them. I usually enjoy Indian movies a lot, but this was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story has no place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can not figure out where it's supposed to be happening.
