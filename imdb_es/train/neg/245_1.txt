Undoubtedly, Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies that have been made, but still retains affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and the amazing and horrible sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest , that's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously divergent. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the "space" is as unfathomable as the cinematography, since the bottles of liquid that wash pass in front of your eyes and are cushioned. dialogue. Before you have had time to find out if it is you who has gone mad, the credits and the action come to life. <br /> <br /> And apart from the giant two-headed clay snail that terrifies our heroes, you also get the additional double bonus of having the actors' original voices and voices dubbed at the same time. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this type of rate is that I have only seen one copy, so it is very unlikely that you will see it yourself. Maybe I have the only copy that exists. <br /> <br />
