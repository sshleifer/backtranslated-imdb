I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen in a long time. It is very disturbing at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who is in gore & splatter. I found myself gritting my teeth during some of the scenes mentioned. The smart thing about the movie is that it plays on our fears and, therefore, The Dentist is quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by all. But if you're a fan of strange and weird entertainment and getting your teeth pierced, this is just the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and you feel attracted by this type of entertainment. , test it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
