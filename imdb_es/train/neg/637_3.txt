The Good Earth is not a great movie, in any way, it's normal. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but who would want to see the life of a farmer. I do not care much. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent acting job, but the movie went on too long. I could have told you the end of this movie before the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his own father, is exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wives as they are on their death beds. The film makes a complete 360 ​​that goes from one generation to another. In addition, this movie did not have good character actors or funny moments, it was just something depressing about the duration of a farmer in times of crisis.
