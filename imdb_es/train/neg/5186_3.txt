The RKS films have always been commercial films that were adapted to the 90s, by GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His latest KHAKEE films were visible. FAMILY was a shit. <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie, but I could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is that there are a lot of old-fashioned clich√©s and many scenes are too fleeting and long <br /> <br /> The character of Ajay Devgan is very good, but his character becomes heroic, which could be subtle. <br /> <br /> Prolonged flashback could be avoided, since the signals are simply long <br /> <br /> Even the street game in the second half seems too simplistic and hardly a solution The message is well done. <br /> <br /> The RKS address is decent, although it could be better. The music is good. <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks great in the part and is happy to play his part. in its majority, although sometimes it is seen badly at ease in scenes of light, it excels in dramatic. Vidya stands out on the scene in front of the media. Pankaj does not have a defined role and is too cinematic. he stands out for his part the hams of Darshan Jariwala as the villain of old age the rest are fine
