Stewart Moss plays a scientist who is on a work trip with his wife, and one has the feeling that he was chosen for this role because of his ability to roll his eyes in his head ... imagine the auditions for this. .. you can ... no, that's not all, thanks, next! "Anyway, he's bitten by a bat, and then he's either becoming a kind of bat creature and killing people or ... he's not, because nobody else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that is changing because your wedding ring comes off when your hands become claws, etc. To your credit, the movie is not limited to if you're just crazy or if it's actually becoming something until almost the end. some good places and some kind of decent atmosphere at times, but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat scant story and the wonderfully bad acting. kind of fun in a way "so bad that it's good", but leans more towards simply bad, 4 out of 10
