Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we actually enjoy them. However, this was not a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. One man, I offer Vince, who is cocky enough to become the main character, although he probably got drunk / drugged - probably both - and thought it was a good idea to make a movie. He then proceeded to show his script to equally tall / drunken individuals. In general, this movie was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not get through it in 20 minutes before turning it off. Make them serve you look like a Kane citizen. Bat Man? WTF ... A guy who walks with a bat, really original. Almost as good as calling him Fat, and having a fat man walking in a superhero costume.
