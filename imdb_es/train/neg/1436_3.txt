Oh darling. Some of the best talents of British television made this series, so I can only assume that they were working under an incredible time pressure and that they had to settle for the first shots of many scenes. <br /> <br /> scenes in this Highland mystery (mainly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from their point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story uninvited amusing. Like the moment the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm, this is a bit disconcerting ... <br /> <Br /> For many years, fans of British cult television programs campaigned to launch this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why!
