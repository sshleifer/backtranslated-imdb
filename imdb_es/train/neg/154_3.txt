I watched this on DVD in the original language with English subs. Either the subtitle was very poor or the real dialogue does not make much history and gives no character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this, but the film does not need your presence to improve it or make it worse. It's just plain bad. The bright and colorful CG scenes are attractive for colors and brightness, but can be overwhelming in a short time. In any case, this makes me think of a child's film with its endless bombing of CG, fight scenes and garbage trap. I'm sure I understood what happened in the movie, but the whole story was pretty bad.
