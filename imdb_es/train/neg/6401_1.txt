Can I do it until I need glasses? At least it demonstrates the point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who unleashed this miserable bunch of vomiting throwing on the world, lack any appearance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should consist of the last labotimized, and babies who play with their own feces. Any other person would be too wise in the world to get a giggle from this movie. It consists of a series of sophisticated dramas in which the auction line does not even extend to the obvious. It ends in the ridiculous. The jokes that are told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually going to the bathroom or related to sex) in which they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like Dad's car and Mom's garage. Applying a more severe method of criticism would be useless, since creative "minds" have never heard of the usual standards of acting, writing, directing and such. behind this mess. Not to judge, but anyone who has enjoyed this movie should seriously reflect on their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
