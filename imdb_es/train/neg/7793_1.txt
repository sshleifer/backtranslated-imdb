This is really one of the worst movies that have been made. I consider myself a big fan of zombie movies and, generally, I tolerate bad acting, boring "special effects", a stupid story and what I can find in second-rate movies, BOTH, since the film has a Good atmosphere / history / suspension or anything else to offer. This, basically, does not have any positive aspect and is of third or fourth degree, maybe worse. Some of my friends and I made a little movie during a week of vacation and we definitely did a better job (although there is no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny, without talking about something else. Special effects really bad and redundant, zombies that look like normal people (except for an additional white skin that covers the face), WAY TO MUCH false blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies are debatable, but The presented gore is simply dumb). The camera remains quite long with feeding scenes, it becomes boring and you can not help but wonder why zombies use ARMS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the details of the dubbing (others have done so). Although I'm from Germany and I'm a bit curious about the original version, I will NOT waste any more time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away from her, as much as possible.
