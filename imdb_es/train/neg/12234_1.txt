I think it was pointless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it is ridiculous to do a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters dies (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.). The story ended after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story continue. That was meaningless!
