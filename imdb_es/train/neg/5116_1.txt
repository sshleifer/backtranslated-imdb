Today I rented this movie thinking it could be a good football movie, since I am a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This film is too religious and preaches and is REALLY unrealistic. This movie practically says that if you're a Christian, you can get everything you want in life easily, like becoming a great soccer player! You do not become a great soccer player by becoming a Christian and by asking God to do so through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you anything ... puh-lease. That is not true at all, duh. I laughed several times for this shame. The only part that was funny was when they were being mute (Shultz, the caricaturist? No, the guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc., etc.) but in reality this movie was not so good. I do not recommend it, especially if you're not a Christian, hahaha.
