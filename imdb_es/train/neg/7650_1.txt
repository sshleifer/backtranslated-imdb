I know I'm in the minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog It reminds us of another hundred untalented hacks that produce a useless crap-festival after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's a crap-fest. Slater's talent is only minimally used, which leads him to believe that he has other things (such as his failed relationship) in his mind. Reid acts as if he had forgotten his acting lessons, had given him a hard blow to the head and MADE to forget his acting lessons, or had one of the worst directors in film history. I am voting for the third option myself, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I have obtained the slightest pleasure. Frankly, I'm satisfied that he made this stinker. I was worried that Bloodrayne would compete with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I'm sure that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry about. <br /> <br /> This qualifies a 1.0 / 10 rating for this messy and confusing crap-fest, of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
