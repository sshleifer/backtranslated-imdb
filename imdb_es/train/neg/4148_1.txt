I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the film and soon I was dragged into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> Finally I know. how is hell Is this movie For eternity. This movie has no value. I did not even have a plot. Things happened in every scene, but there is no general explanation of why nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you put oil in the closest blender and try to put as many bullets into it as you want. can. You will find that the result is much more pleasant than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even see it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you see it, then it means that they win.
