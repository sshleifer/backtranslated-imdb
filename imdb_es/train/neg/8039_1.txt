This meaningless movie is a piece of shit and boring as the reruns of the whole house. For all the people who want to see a great horror movie, exciting and great, you should not even think about seeing this pile of work without meaning. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what were you thinking? Let's make a list: 1) Incorrect script 2) Bad script 3) Bad script 4) Bad acting 5) Bad address and finally bad script. I mean, I'm not like snarling with every movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. This movie must be banned in a box, locked and sunk in the sea. So please do not do something like this again, please, please, please.
