Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Simply referring to movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The film opens well enough with a funny scene of white people and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The film falls from there unfortunately. The acting is horrible. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie seems hacked and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longest gags in this snail-rhythm movie, involving joints and a Tom Cruise movie mentioned above, were not fun for anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, stops at 83 minutes in a surprisingly unpleasant ending. (I say shocking because the end does not even try to end with humor). I do not know what else to say, except that it is a careless and hasty succession made to make Miramax have more money on the backs of stupid teenagers. In general, a very bad movie.
