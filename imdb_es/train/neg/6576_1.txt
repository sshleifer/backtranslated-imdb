I totally disagree with those comments that say this is a good movie. This is a totally sucked movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner went from being an innocent girl to a girl looking for fun at the party without any convincing reason. Also, all the actresses looked too old to be college students. The university students seemed to be around 30 years old, you decipher the rest. I watched only the first ten minutes and started to move quickly to look for sex scenes. All sex scenes are lame, hurried and, most importantly, nothing frontal. All the sex scenes are ridiculous, considering the amount of clothes they were wearing. Do yourself a favor, lower it and save yourself a few dollars. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out of 10.
