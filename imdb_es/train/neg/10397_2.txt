It's just not the quality I expected from Morris (I love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very similar to a movie not so bad for students. What worries me, in all this is WHY WAS A BAFTA? Morris mocks the "consecrated mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) and, however, with this piece is urinating on the back of the talented and telling us it is raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope you have chosen a topic that I would love to address (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that will not ruin you, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of ignorance and the opinion of the mainstream on this emotional phenomenon and strongly spun.
