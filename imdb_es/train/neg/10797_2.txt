There was a genius played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was an idiot. Their rhymes were corny, these lines were bad for a stupid child who cried for his stupid father, bad action, bad throws, bad special effects, what's next? This movie sucks. Prolly did not earn 20 dollars. Live in a boombox, do not hurt a lamp like a cramp like a seal of wet food ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you understand, a stupid genius of rhymes that can not act, in a stupid movie with horrible effects special Oh, and it's as confusing as hell. I'm not even going to continue. Let's say it belongs to the category "it's so bad, it's fun". Watch it once with your friends and have fun. But do not expect anything spectacular.
