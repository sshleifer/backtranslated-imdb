A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Who was imperfect but very nice (my rating was a 7), created this piece of junk about the city of New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and it was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie, I did not recognize the city of New York, I did not feel I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 townships, I did not see any scenes in the Bronx, or Queens, there's a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes from the beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a large cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were cartoons of the lowest type. <br /> <br /> The very few humorous moments are all of a sexual nature or quite insulting to many. good New Yorkers that we all know and love ... <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my thinking, I think the title should have been <br> /> <br /> NEW YORK, I HATE YOU.
