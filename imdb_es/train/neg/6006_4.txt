I did not agree with any of the theologies of the Left Behind series, but nonetheless, I found that the books are exciting and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Undoubtedly good writing and interesting history. However, I did not have many expectations for the movie. There was no way the mainstream Hollywood would have taken a Christian series and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently ... and I felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just did not feel like a movie; I did not have that "experience" in the movie, if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of that, and the poor low-budget special effects were another disadvantage for me. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was unfortunately badly known as Nicolie Carpathia. When reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be a charming, dazzling, and astonishingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost no trace of accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan on paper. Instead, they found Clay Aiken with the pencil neck that looks like a Best Buy employee of the month, and they gave him a very bad fake accent. So I lost some stars for me right there. A movie is not convincing when the main villain does not look or sound like it is supposed to. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, but nothing great. Some of the scenes, like one of the conversion scenes (I can not remember which one) were real squats for me. And part of the Christian rock music or whatever, it was really out of place for some of the scenes, like Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In summary, it was not like that. A bad movie, but it just did not do it for me. Stay with the book, friends, it's much better.
