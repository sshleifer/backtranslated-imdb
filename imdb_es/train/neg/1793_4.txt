An interesting concept of vampirism that has something to do with a virus (but made several times so far) In general, the film is too long and it lasts a little. The edition could have been stricter. I'm sorry to hear the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie was taken to the market. The lighting was too dark in some places. But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have an echo sound, which is very annoying. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mix could have been better. There was also too much background noise. I should have got someone to make sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The clang of swords pounding together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in combat scenes, the editing needed to be stricter. <br /> <br /> The performance was also a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie, in my experience it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave it a 4.
