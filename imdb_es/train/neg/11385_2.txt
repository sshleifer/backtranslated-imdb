Before I begin, let me say that my experience of this film could have been influenced by the dubbing, which, according to other comments, was the original that some consider inferior. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the subtitles or the seemingly new version of DVD make a difference. Nor have I read the corresponding book; I'm just familiar with another Japanese manga and may lack cultural context. <br /> <br /> Possible minor spoilers in the future. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like science fiction stories with dark nuances (like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie at all. Although it started a little intriguing, it became tedious at the time it was half-finished. There are all kinds of problems; Let's start with what is probably the most severe: dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; If the names of others are not shouted for the umpteenth time, they are usually monosyllabic grunts ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most of the characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not help in the least that many of them get only a few minutes of screen time with nothing interesting to say that develops them away from the stereotypes suggested by the images. <br /> <br /> The grunt is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophy technology that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing profound or meaningful here, everything seems disorganized, grouped randomly from several fragments of science fiction ideas without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The little that there is of an intelligible plot is It is not more than an excuse to begin the final sequence, that consists of escalating scenes of chaos and destruction. It's not that there's anything wrong with a bit of chaos and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself asking "what is the point of all this and how much time is left for it to end?" The development of the character in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo becoming Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The ending resembles that of 2001: a strange series of images that, far from solving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling that he has only been looking at a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will say that this kind of thing is art; but for me it was just a great imaginative use of color and shapes. (Part of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately, everything is style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Do you want to watch animated films that intelligently treat "adult" themes? It saddens me to say that he's more likely to find that kind of thing in "South Park."
