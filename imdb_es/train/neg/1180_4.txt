Notorious for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), its darkness is the greatest asset it seems. Hey, it's often better to talk about that, instead of seeing it when you can not endorse the "legend" with substance. <br /> <br /> The film has been played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently, and is available in the home video, so the veil slowly rises. While there is still much to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them, to awaken a lot of real passion. Except for a scene of XXX sex free and prolonged between a pair of horses (someone from "Nature Documentary"?), Follow almost an hour of a dull marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> Once sex and nudity begins, it is a continuous sequence that includes masturbation, a flash of looooooooong to a supposed encounter of 'the beauty and the beast', and a naked woman running around the mansion (nobody, even her supposedly protective aunt, seems to even think about putting some clothes on her!). In the video, I think you can move quickly through banality, but it really is not worth the effort. The nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial, as THE DREAMS OF Bertolucci. <br /> <br /> Try as you might find something of "moral" or "symbolism" in the carnality, I doubt it is worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie more easily, the notoriety of something that was once "prohibited" has been eliminated. And this beast has been domesticated.
