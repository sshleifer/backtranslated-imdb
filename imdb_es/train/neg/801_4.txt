Despite their stereotypes, the virtually 'nameless' cast and an obviously low budget, I thought this movie was fine; Much better than I expected. At first I was skeptical: the idea of ​​a computer virus that could also infect people seemed a little ridiculous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a bit cliché). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, and the two tracks seemed to take their roles very seriously. However, I could not help thinking that Janine Turner is a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just his face or the makeup, the hair and the clothes I had in this movie, but it just bothered me in the back of my mind all the time. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a 'must see' or a great movie by any standard, 'Fatal error' is an entertaining movie that will keep you watching until the end.
