OMG! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is fun like an Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from that, how did this half decent cast sign up to make such an unconvincing movie? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at that moment ... There are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateur. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably falls on the director, Joel Zwick. It does not get anything more than flat performances from everyone involved. Do not waste your time like I did; But then, I enjoy a good train crash. Heavens, now the system is telling me that I need more lines. Here you are: this movie should be called Return to sender. Well, now THAT was more fun than anything in the movie ...
