Take an original SciFi movie and mix it into a small alternative / revisionist story, and you'll get "Aztec Rex." Apparently, Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, first had to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion. That is the thrust of this movie. Given the plot could have really plagued; The fact that it's just a bit sucked is a tip of the cap for writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cort√©s is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be interpreted by a set of all Hawaiians. Leaving aside, the T-Rex (s) look reasonably well, although every time one of them is shot, it simply oozes CGI. And they die very easily; I suppose if there were a T-Rex in real life, they could probably be shot down or, at least, injured by some pretty rudimentary weaponry of the sixteenth century. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic scenes of T-Rex-swallowing-human, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There is a lot of action, and the whole colonization angle prevails along, but it does not exceed the dinosaur angle, unlike the other original SciFi dinosaur movie "Warbirds". In general, a mediocre movie (but decent by SciFi Original standards) that qualifies a modest 4.
