Woohoo! I remember so many horrible movies that revolved around high school since the early eighties. In general, they had an incredibly tense plot and many 27-year-old actors posing as students. While watching this movie, I felt a bit of the nostalgia of growing up in the eighties. However, then I discover that this movie was made in 1989? What what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to transport all students to high schools downtown. Which is strange, in the sense that the students of this school are rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. It makes you wonder how they can not find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes? Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if the students can raise $ 200,000. So the elders are going to do this. Hmmm, do you raise $ 200,000 but instead of saving that for college, do you put it to save the high school where you are a Senior? And why exactly would they close an overcrowded school before the end of the year? And ... ahh, forget it, this movie was stupid and it was made in 1989!
