Joe Don's opening line tells all about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker tracking down an Italian mobster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this movie is shoot people and be arrested again and again. Everyone in the movie hates it, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked an earlier photo of Greydon, "Angel's Revenge," because it was a shirne for three-year-olds. Avoid this movie at all costs!
