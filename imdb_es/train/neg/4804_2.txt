I do not watch much television and I found this show. Reality show? I hope this is not real. If I were a man and I had so much disgust and was married to someone so stupid, it would be a reason for divorce. I think she is a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love. That is one thing that is wrong in our world now, many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what it really is to love another. It is selfless and it is not something that should be in merritt. That does not give you a very good feeling, look what it should be in private counseling. If his personality in the program is real, then he deserves someone much better to show true love and affection for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or fact for grades? I'd really like to know. Sincerely, GB
