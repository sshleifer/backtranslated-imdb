Hopefully this is the final nightmare. This is the epitome of a good thing that has gone wrong. Okay, there's still some enjoyment, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had been on the production team and had even produced it. I do not know what I was thinking, but this debacle is complete with the human videogame and a special appearance of <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had an idea of ​​what I was thinking when he wrote / directed this piece of disappointing garbage. He even tried to distract his audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than a popcorn movie about glorified instead of having any resemblance to horror, with the artificial use of a 3D ending. Are not these glasses ingenious? And you keep them! It's the equivalent of, you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here you have 10 cents. Now, do not you feel special? I'm sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another facelift. This was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful art that went into its "look" in the previous films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper and less detailed set of prosthetics. It looks ... less like the burn victim it's supposed to be, and more like it's a skin disorder. Changing the composition of the protagonist in that way so far in a series is almost the same level as changing the main actor. But wait! They have done that, and done that. So I guess it does not matter. But I cared. Freddy is no longer SCARY. It's just ... another low-income monster like the Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic that promises this series; plagued of what can only hope that the writers thought that they were ingenious of a single line and astute repaired (lamentably, it was short in both accounts). <br /> <br /> So there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because there was not a moment of fear or suspense in this whole movie. <br /> <br /> Rate a 3.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
