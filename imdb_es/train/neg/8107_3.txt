This movie is pretty boring. There are fragments of naked flesh thrown in an unconvincing attempt to keep the viewer awake but they do not succeed. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Lena Olin: she does a masterful job of handling it. character, but Day-Lewis confuses most of his lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The inconsistencies in the rebound between domestic / marital problems and political crises are very little compatible. Attitudes of character change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.
