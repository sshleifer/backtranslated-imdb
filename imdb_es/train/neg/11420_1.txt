St. Elmo's Fire has no connection with life after college (for most of us, ordinary people anyway). Why was this garbage made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors who have to deal with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who have done a good job in other places. It must have been just a joke to them on the set. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found this "movie" insulting my intelligence. The only joy I got from this is that Sir John Hughes had a good laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year that his masterpiece The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> Do not do The same mistake I made when seeing this because you enjoy the 80s movies. It really is that offensive for the genre.
