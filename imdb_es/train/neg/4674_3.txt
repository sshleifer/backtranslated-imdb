I do not know who is at fault, Miss Leigh or her director, but her interpretation of Catherine is almost impossible to see. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does a superior job: against all odds as far as I'm concerned. Your character is too charming and attractive. but he certainly is not greedy enough to endure the nonsense of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems puzzled by what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but by his orthopedic instability. There must be some element of credibility in their interest, but as interpreted it is incomprehensible. The performances are not jibe. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite any effort to derail them. The cast is also a pleasure to watch. What a pity, too, the drivers do not work together because the production is beautiful to look at.
