The film appeals to the public due to the charisma of Ben Stiller and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there is nothing successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> Polly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the kind of character that adapts perfectly to her. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same annoying guy as in "Meet the Parents", but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special at all. With these two well-paid actors, things could improve a lot, but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
