All Germans stand out in the open and cut themselves with a machine gun. the good ones never die, unless it is for dramatic purposes. The "plot" has so many holes that its laugh. (Where did the German soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijack a train? What a fool that is! The Germans KNOW where you're going, it's not like you can leave the track and walk away! What a waste. I would rather hit myself on the head with a ball hammer 10 times and then sit down again. I mean, seriously, FEEL it as if it had been made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88! 1988 !! Team A is more credible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just look at it if you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was for John Wayne.
