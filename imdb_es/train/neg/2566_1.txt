I took part of GEORGE 2 on television recently, but I could not see it until the end. Simply unpleasant! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There are many unruly people around, but the direction and editing were so bad and choppy, it was like watching shots or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not enough to cheer me on. GEORGE 2 is probably the only worst sequel I've seen, and that's saying something. God, due to the rule of the 10 lines of IMDb, I have to continue writing when I have nothing more to say about this sequel to Crapulastic made for television. Disney, duck your head in shame.
