What is it? is a mixture of strange recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and openly racist music, among others) without restrictions of any kind of narrative, plot or character development. Everything seemed like a "show freak", and I do not mean just the unusual casting decisions. It has the feeling of a bad trip with acid, far beyond any level of drug use that one can attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare it to is Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie of all time), which was intentionally much more depressing, but I still found what is it? A total loss of my time. It's one thing to take a look at the inner workings of another person's mind, even the chemically altered consciousness of another person, but quite another to simply throw out strange images just for the sake of oddity.
