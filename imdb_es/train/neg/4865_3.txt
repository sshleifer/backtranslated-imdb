I just did not enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in the city, and I've been spoiled talking about animal movies that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not nice. Everyone was irritating, especially the guinea pig of Chris Rock, but then, what can I expect? It's Chris Rock. I think I smiled once or twice at a couple of nice lines, but that's it.
