This program proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious space on the hard drive of the DVR. I did not expect much and actually received less. Not only do I expect this program to be canceled in the second episode, but I can not believe that Geico will try to use the cavernous cave advertising campaign ever. I would have preferred to spend a night checking my daughter's hair for lice instead of seeing this piece of garbage. I wonder what happened to ABC so that this program fits the fall 2007 schedule, maybe a hospital / crime / memoir with the AFLAC duck? In case you did not express my opinion about this program, let me be clear and say that it is not too good.
