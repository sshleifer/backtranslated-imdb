The only real highlight of the film is the death of the shy and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In all other respects, this movie is a scam by Jaws, Lake. Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As is the standard of a horror movie of the 90s, the two non-protagonist females take off their clothes at least once. . The protagonist does not do it, since obviously she has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really silly extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut and surf in shark-infested waters. In this movie, a giant saltwater crocodile is also in the area. People eat. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate a boring horror movie, which it definitely is.
