I've been looking for this movie for years because it's quite rare to find it, since it was one of the unpleasant videos. Finally I found it on a DVD at the end of last year, it's a very low budget movie. The story revolves around the tribes of the Amazon rainforest that live with the fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her to the jungle. Laura is guarded by a ridiculous native who calls himself "The Devil" and has to go through all the unpleasant things until they are happy. The maidens are chained. The devil demonstrates eating meat in a horrible way. Peter Weston, is the demon hunter, who goes to the jungle to try to rescue her.
