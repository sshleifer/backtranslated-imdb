I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective image and more consistency. This is just a series of pure propaganda, very dark, without charm or romanticism, it's just boredom. I find that the actors work quite weak too. O'Donnell may look charming like Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he has no charm. Probably, as he gets older, he is losing his childhood charm, but he does not gain any adult charm. No wonder, since it was not shown in many countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
