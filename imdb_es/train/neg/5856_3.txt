T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not grow up with changing times, styles and fashions. It's like being trapped in the same style of making movies in the old style. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, they are not good either. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly in both his father and son roles, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then, she is always good, and here is nothing more than that. She does the best of what she is given, but always does that. In conclusion, nothing great. Raveena is fine, which means it's normal, it's not bad, it's not right, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, even then it would still be below the standard. The script is terrible, the film is exaggerated and the story is not going anywhere. It feels like a movie made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, unless you be a big fan of The actors protagonists.
