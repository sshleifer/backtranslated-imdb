Really, very bad movie slasher. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later he kills a professor of sociology, end of scene. A semester later (hey, that's what the title card says) a new sociology teacher is in school. She makes friends with another sociology teacher who works there and starts dating another teacher. All the students are bored, like us. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate how much time has passed. The scenes are quite short, and are cut to different characters in another place, which makes the progression is small of any kind. Many scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and have little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes, the unclear passage of time means that when we see a body a second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? And also, at least one of the dead people does not seem to have been missed by others. <br /> <br /> The murderer manages to kill a person by stabbing her in the chest, and another by stabbing him in the groin. , and another for cutting off his forehead. Is your knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box has a cheerleader: there is none in the movie. The back cover has a picture of someone wearing a graduation cap and a dress that threatens a group of women in a bedroom. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but no one wears a suit like that, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
