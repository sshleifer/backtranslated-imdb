Connie Hoffman is very pretty and, at times, she is very attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, friends. The only reason to even consider whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These pieces of the sexplotación period of the 70 are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their same date (flared trousers, big hair, shoe mustaches, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a romantic elder is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title, implying a sexual comedy, is extremely deceptive. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding this as the plague.
