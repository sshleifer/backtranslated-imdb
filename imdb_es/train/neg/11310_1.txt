First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you did not already know, then I think you're a jerk. But suppose none of us is a jerk. We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see how these emotions manifest themselves in nature, right? <br /> <br /> Instead, what we get is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that tries to show what animals are like. "human". The filmmakers search high and low images of animals engaged in human behavior, and when it happens, they say: "That monkey is almost human!" (actually it's a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time in theorizing about what makes dogs "smile", but not once do they mention what it means to wave their tail. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even show chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I expected an insightful documentary about animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals move in their OWN languages. But, on the other hand, researchers continue to resort to assumptions and pedantic, anthropomorphic observations. Add a Cheezy soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas," and this was enough to make my stomach churn. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary is not filmed in nature, but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All chimpanzee shots are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys pile up in their sterile concrete cages. A particularly amazing moment occurs near the beginning (although you have to realize it quickly) when a captive monkey says in sign language: "I want to leave. Hurry up." <br /> <br /> Dark references are made to "" Stress tests "and psychological experiments that I shudder to imagine Monkeys separate from their mothers at birth and are given wire dolls to prove that the monkeys babies crave a "mother figure." And after 40 years of experiments, researchers slap each other on the back to reach their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe "She has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and to this day she remains that way." We have a brief look (again through bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather tarnished expression. I do not need to see any more experimental data, Washoe, I apologize for our entire species.
