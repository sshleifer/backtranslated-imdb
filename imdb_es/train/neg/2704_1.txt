I do not understand why people would praise this garbage. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, horrible and almost everything else. The film is a vision of life, racial problems, prejudices and everything that happens strangely in the university. This is where it fails. It has no handles in reality. Of many questionable scenes without meaning in the film, such as <br /> <br /> a black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man and arrested by the security guards handcuffed and executed while the gunman passes right in front of them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who attacks people from a rooftop issue that the same black man stopped and shot down was stopped and given a Rodney King-style beating while the gunman runs . free, a moment later, being pursued by only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As one previous critic pointed out Several 230-pound white men were beaten by several black men who weighed about 160 pounds, including the 105-pound bust A Rimas <br /> <br /> Another failure Criticism in the movie are the main characters uninteresting and uninteresting. Of frightened and confused whites and evil, angry and, nevertheless, legitimate blacks. It's almost like an insult to whites and blacks. I am a white man and I know many black and Hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray the characters and gives them these characteristics exclusively because of their race. <br /> <br /> The story that I will explain now revolves around three characters. One black athlete, the other a frightened and confused white girl who questions her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and frightened, then blames black people for his problems in which he becomes a Nazi later in life. the movie. Everyone has their share of problems and adventures that include sex, rape, fighting, love, hate, prejudice, racial warfare and, oh yes, do not forget education. What it all comes down to in the end for the fatal shooting. In which after they return to their boring lives and think "being white is bad". Does this sound a lot like your college years? I did not believe it. I do not think the director attended the university, especially if he had to make this terrible disaster. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a really bad, bad and ugly movie. If you want to see a more accurate view or racial problems, go to American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of the college income Porkys. Just avoid this mess.
