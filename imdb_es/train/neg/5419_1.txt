Why do filmmakers always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed by the interest of the viewer, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delicious. I can not believe that you have chosen to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea in such a terrible disaster. Look at everything that was lost doing that. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for God's sake! Would not it have been a pleasure to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of putting them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This movie was a disappointment after seeing the successful way it brought Anne of Green Gables to life.
