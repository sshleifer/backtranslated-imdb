"Three Daring Daughters" is a sickly, sweet, pink look, divorce, remarriage and the life of a single parent. Obviously, social problems and economic difficulties have no place in the perfect life of a single mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise and then goes out and marries a band director. Even when the phrase "is just a movie" excuses the script from tackling real-life problems, "Daughters" suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and the band leader Hose Iturbi playing the same. Is not it strange that any real person star in a movie in which his supposed real self gets married? <br /> <br /> It's true that this movie was released in the forties. Only love for the old Hollywood style, romance and comedy could make 'Daughters' a tolerable film.
