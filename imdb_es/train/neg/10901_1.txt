And a little more "no" on top of that. Voodoo Academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly are you trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; As noted, most of them are just barely legal individuals rubbing themselves. Could it be, then, an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if it's not for the fact that it never goes beyond the most innocuous and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which is, to the delight of no one, repeated some eighty thousand times). Well, it's a kind of horror movie; Are you trying to scare us? No, unless the director intended to do so through the tedium and emptiness of his "work." <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've seen. It's as if Voodoo Academy took the genres of horror, zombies and gay movies, put them in a grinder and then pass them through a coffee filter; just that instead of being the kind of coffee filter that filters the coffee beans, it's the kind that brings out everything vital, nervous, or in some interesting way. The result is 74 minutes of film as exciting as a glass of warm water, only without the ability to rehydrate after the 10-day gin intake that will inevitably happen to you if you observe this abomination of human effort.
