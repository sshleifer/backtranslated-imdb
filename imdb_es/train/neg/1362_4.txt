Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very unpleasant movie. <br /> <br /> The film shows promises that Ustinov is released from prison for embezzlement. He convinces Robert Morley to leave to be able to assume his identity and start hacking computers in a very elegant signature directed by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo of films. <br /> <br /> Morley sounds simply like he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette". Maybe, I needed to go back to that genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her behavior and gave a shocking Oscar performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smith is made here to be a seemingly silly-red head, but at the end of the movie, she is the brains behind the outfit. Too bad the writing did not go the way with it.
