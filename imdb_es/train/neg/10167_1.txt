This movie for television shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw this was because it was covered in a KTMA MST3K. It's the Super Bowl in the Superdome in New Orleans. However, soccer is not played at all and we see that behind the scenes you can hardly see anything. With the many stars in this movie, it made no difference. I really do not know why I saw this.
