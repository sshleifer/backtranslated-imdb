As a poker enthusiast, I expected to see this movie, especially because I had Scotty Nyugen. <br /> <br /> Basically, the short spots of Scotty Nyugens in this movie are all in his favor. <Br /> <br /> The characters are unpleasant and annoying, the soundtrack is horrible and the plot, well, there is none. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my head ached and I found myself reading the bar code number on the DVD Box after twenty minutes I was so bored. It really is a shame that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise, he would not have lost $ 16 by buying on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me! Terrible. :(
