Wow. The only people who are reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists. I know a lot about that. The boys who will see John Carpenter crouch on celluloid and pinch a movie and proclaim it a horror masterpiece. This "movie" is absolute shit. It seems and sounds like a porn movie (good sir, the soundtrack is horrible ...), and has a sub-par porn performance, which is shocking, because Ron Perlman is really a really good actor. Honestly, I have no idea what Carpenter was thinking about doing this. Most likely "beans, beans, beans ..." until someone has fed and rolled them in a blanket for the day ... They do not say anything about the abortion debate, when they could have had a very central issue interesting (how do anti-abortion religious fanatics feel when it's the baby of the devil?), but instead, they chose Ron Perlman and his terrible children to kill a group of people and make the horribly chosen doctors try to calm the hysterically ill pregnant girl. There is not a single person in this episode or what should come out unharmed. It is simply horrible. Like, Outerspace Plan 9 horrible. Like, my God, please, would someone turn it off before it gets dirty? Try to see this and The Thing on the same day and your mind will implode.
