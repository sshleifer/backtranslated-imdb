A broken person would be a screenwriter and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self-service storage center run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) who they believe is the serial killer who is terrorizing the city, the "Costume Killer" (so called because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them with foolish disguises). They convince him that the story of his life would be a great movie and will bring together a group of filmmakers who do not fit in with the team (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of making movies can be murder. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film, but unfortunately it was left on the floor of the editing room and it is seen (the rumor is that the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who do all the good jobs and deserve something better), since this has the character of an exceptional black comedy, but only rises to be mediocre. <br /> <br /> If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worthy of getting just for your performance. His comic time is excellent and he has the opportunity to make some really great impressions (he was not kidding when he said in the comments of the Hellboy movie that he needed an intervention when he enters Jerry Lewis mode). He is simply fun to watch in this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a double (but fundamental) role.
