It's a bad movie, it seems that there are only 5 policemen in HK, they did not use the weapon and that makes me feel like a Jacky Chan movie. All the time they were using their weapon to target the suspect only. When they finally use their weapon is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In The Movie, it's as if all the good guys died without a reason. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the movie also sucks, the story jumps here and there and the boring people. Butundary bloody movie, I think that this is only a kind of acceptableoples movie, I experiment cinnamon movies madeolla the United States Emotional.
