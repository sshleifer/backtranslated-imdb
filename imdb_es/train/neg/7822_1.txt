This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this made me want to shoot me. Very poor performance, scandalous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To summarize: Superman leaves the earth, because scientists discovered fragments of his home planet, some were in space (duh), do not say anything to his girlfriend before leaving (duh again), take off in a spaceship (? !?), Llega Volver, I think 5 years later, and I hope to reconnect with his girlfriend (who is now devastating her son, whose son, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, just because I can not vote 0. If you have something else to do with your time, do not go see this movie And even if you have nothing else to do , stay at home and watch TV!
