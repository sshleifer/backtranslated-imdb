A terrible amateur film director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. The friend and the sister fall and are rescued. Meanwhile, a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'territory'. Whatever the hell means. This film and I use the term VERY loosely it's so bad that it's ... well, bad. The humor is painfully graceless, the "action" simply sad. Now I've seen some awful awful horror movies in my time and I have not tired of watching low budget movies, but I'm still crying openly for anyone who chooses to sit through this. ONLY for the hardest maschocists among you. but the rest flees FAST! <br /> <br /> My Rating: F
