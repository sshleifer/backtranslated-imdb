This is not the worst movie I've seen of Peter Greenaway but it's close. That dishonor goes to the worst pillow book. The films of this 3 director that I have seen I find all miserable. Like The Cook ..., whatever positive cinematographic appearance it shows, it is not redeemed at all by the disgust of its material and its general presentation.
