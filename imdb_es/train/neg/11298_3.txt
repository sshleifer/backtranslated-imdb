This is a direct sequel to 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940), because the main character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and is telling the story (with the help of archive footage) to the boyfriend of your son. . There are only two unusual aspects in the film: the early death of Banning and the presence of Turhan Bey. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney, like the mummy Kharis, has the highest reputation, although given the nature of his role, he has little more to do than limp or shake his arms. There is nothing scary in his presence, except for his attempt to take the boyfriend, Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets the second billing, but he was killed in the first fifteen minutes! We would have to wait until 'Psycho' (1960) when a main character (Janet Leigh) dies before the end of the movie. Banning's friend from the first movie, Babe Jenson (now Henson), appears a little later looking for much, much more, older and without doing any of the comical tricks he did in the original. It's hard to believe it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting job is wasted because Kharis kills him after only two brief scenes. Then let Banning's son, John (played by bit player John Hubbard), take the chase to the cemetery: NO! The sheriff leads a crowd with a torch wielding Banning's house to burn it and kill the mummy. Does it sound universally familiar? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is presented to the public as the new High Priest, Mehmet Bey, to care for and nourish the leaves of Tana to Kharis. With his 'exotic' voice and appearance, it is a pity that he is killed so easily. A better movie would have made 'Babe' take the type of von Helsing in charge of tracking down the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But, instead, we have a pedestrian replay of different pieces of the previous Universal horror films, organized by the pirate Griffin Jay, who wrote many of Universal's other thieves, but so did 'Don Winslow of the Navy' (1942), as well as 'Don Winslow of the Coast Guard' (1943) who also counted on Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six films by Joe Palooka (1946-1949), and of course, Turhan Bey, with 43 movies and television credits, is excellent in the lead role of 'The Amazing Dr. X '(1948). <br /> <br /> The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with many noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than 'Kharis' first mummy movie, but there is little more interest or emotion. <br /> <br /> I'll give you a 3.
