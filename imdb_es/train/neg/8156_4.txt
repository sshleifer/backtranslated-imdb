Prom Night 2 is a good horror movie, but graduation night is much better and this film is about how Queen Mary Lou Lou in 1957 is murdered by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside and the film is starring other actors and OK actress such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some bloody scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl who is trying to hide in her locker. crush the lockers together and how one of the students is on the computer and Mary Lou electrocutes him to death. In general, this is a good horror movie, and my rating is 4 out of 10.
