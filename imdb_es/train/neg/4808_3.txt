Ok, I've seen a lot of movies that deal with witches and the occult, but this one was just weird. This film begins as this witch cult led by a really bad Orson Wells who plays the role of a star (they could not have got someone to look and act more like a Satanist) just did not belong to this movie. But anyway, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that looks like someone and makes her have a miscarriage. The lady who had the miscarriage and her husband went to a place called Lillith on business and the lady is seeing an image of her sister or whoever is calling her and warns her to stay away from there and never use her powers. there or she will die. The couple, after they settled in the strange city, discovered that all the inhabitants are all sorcerers and she intrudes and fears all her neighbors and friends. Then, strange things begin to happen as the lady discovers a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (which was creepy), in addition to seeing the little boy of Orson Wells in the playground that later he asks the lady to help him return. to the life. The lady soon tries to escape from the city but only to be trapped by its inhabitants and powers and is ignoring everything that the spirit tries to warn him. This movie is fine, it has moments of suspense, but it could have done much better than having Orson there.
