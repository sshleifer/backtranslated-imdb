What a horrible movie! The idea that robots fight with each other is great, but the plot is ridiculous, the real human action is ridiculous, it does not exist and the special effects (on which this type of film depends) are archaic. I thought it should have been done around '80 -'84 and I was surprised to see it was 1990. That's 5 years after the Aliens! Well, a lot of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think "what's the point?" it looks totally amazing I would not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story, because I still like the idea of ​​huge robots that hit each other.
