An obvious b-grade effort to take advantage of the noise from the lodge / mountain range, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) And still managed to disappoint at all levels. The acting is so bad that it is not even funny, the plot does not exist and the only scare was to realize that he had lost 1 hour 21 minutes to see it. I'm surprised to see that 34 people gave it a rating of 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34 is possibly the mother director? - although I am sure that even it would be difficult for her to reach more than 2! DVD extras include a one-hour "making of" feature. Which raises the question, "Why?" (Although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
