After seeing the advances, I felt that this movie was going to be a good improvement over that fast and furious series. Therefore, I already hoped that he did not have a story, but at least this time he will not be charged with an impotent civic with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast and Furious movie with a story worse than this one, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in my life (I'm being nice, No, I would not take the baseball bat to my nuts as others have said). Not only the plot did not exist, but the action was also crap. I guess the director thought they could throw a lot of exotic cars and females and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the boy presses the button us and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a McLaren SLR to win. And after the part where Eddy Griffin fought with one of his "girls" (a comment from Imus would work in this case), the girl asks him to stop and leave the PLANE and, of course, they do it in the middle of the Desert. After this wonderful scene I could not take it anymore. So, I could only see half of this monstrosity. This is the first film I had left. Then, I had to stop to drink some drinks to kill all my damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. It is better that you go to the local car show and stop at a strip club on the way home. I will keep all the spectators in my prayers.
