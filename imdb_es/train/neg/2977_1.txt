Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin < br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this movie and get some background, I must start at the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn left in '79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel and call it Zombie 2. That movie is what we know as Zombie. You already know what fight the zombie with the shark! Well, after that movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a lot of cash, the Italians decided, hell. Let's make some more zombie movies! These things are raking in the dough! That's how Zombie 3 was born. Confused already? The story of this is actually just a replay of the stories we've seen in many of the American zombie movies we've seen before, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... the government is doing experiments with certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. The boat is released in the general population and shebang! We get lots of zombies that crave human flesh. A group of people begins to flee from the zombies and ends up in an old abandoned hotel. They must fight against the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There were many problems during the filming of this movie. In the first place, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of the blood of Italy, was ill. So I really could not finish this movie the way I wanted to. The film was then transmitted to two lesser directors, Bruno Mattei (The hell of the living dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did everything possible to spice up a movie that was not so good anymore. You will see that Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul in this movie. I was disenchanted with that. He gave the producers flick and basically said: "Do what you want with that!" And may God love them, they did it. <br /> <br /> And that's why ladies and gentlemen have a fucking zombie movie with the great Fulci, recognized as his "director". The main problem in my opinion is that it is such a useless bore! There is no substance at all! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and release it accidentally, the rest of the movie is just a bunch of empty characters with no soul, no personality that escapes the zombies. Now, in some cases, this can be fun, if # 1 zombie makeup and zombie action is really good and fun and # 2 there are many gore and guts involved. <br /> <br /> Here we do not have any! Well, there are some inspired moments there, such as when some eagles become infected with the gas and start attacking people. That was cool. There is also a scene involving a flying zombie head (which by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies leaving the abandoned hotel pool and chewing the legs of a poor girl. But other than that ... the rest of the movie just falls flat. <br /> <br /> Endless in endless scenes that do nothing to move the plot no longer existing. That was my main complaint with this movie. The sets seem unfinished and the direction of the art is practically nonexistent. I hate when everything seems so damn unfinished! I like my series films, but this really was even below that! It's closer to a z-level movie, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Is the zombie formed? Pure shit. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines), so you get a lot of zombies of Asian appearance. But that's not a big problem since the movie was filmed in the Philippine islands anyway. It's the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what goes through the zombie makeup here is a lot of black makeup (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex make-up, but still was not good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of goo peppered with no sense in the faces of the actors. So not only is this movie slow-paced, but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead people! Anyway, for those who expect the usual coldness in a Fulci movie, do not expect it here, since it is mainly about someone else's movie. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) really did not put heart and soul there. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD, you'll see that when you ask Fragasso about his memories and his feelings in this movie here, he does not even take it seriously. It can be said that he is ashamed of it and on many occasions he says that "they only had one job to do and they did it". And that my friends, is the last nail in this movie. There is no love, and there is no heart set on making this film. Therefore, you get a movie of half zombies and shit. <br /> <br /> Only for more complete people or who want to have or see all the zombie movies that have been made. Everyone else, do not even bother! Rating: 1 of 5
