This movie was long and boring. It is surprising that he was selected for Cannes, although they tend to like the pretension. The point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of the artistic genre such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Moreover, it has no cinematic quality. A long opening shot does not mean cinematic depth, it's just a long, boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not identify with at all. The actors did not shine under his direction and seemed lost at times. Leopold tried, but she is not the talent that I expected her to be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold has just made another attempt.
