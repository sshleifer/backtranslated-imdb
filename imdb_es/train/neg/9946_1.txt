SPOILERS HERE <br /> <br /> My high school did everything it could to try to motivate us for the exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker, who was none other than the favorite son of Australian Kickboxing, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this guy a microphone, because he shouted half the time even though we were not sitting more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now, his speech was full of the usual "if you do not prepare, then prepare to fail", but there were several cases in which I really got excited. The boy stood in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and for no one else. He was offered many offers in the past to leave the kick-box, but he never took his eyes off the prize to become the best kick-box in Australia. He said he was not an exhausting, that he was happy and a retiree, that he was never involved in any other activity than Kickboxing. Then he connected his movie. Yes, you heard correctly, he plugged in his new movie. While talking about it, he got a woman to come in and hold a billboard, and then he showed this 4 minute shit clip of this vile movie called "Trojan Warrior." (All this was before being defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last career fight (for now)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays Ajax, a former kick-boxing special forces agent who is dragged into sordid Melbourne underworld Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) ran out recently (well, at least Stan did not get too far away from EVERYTHING) with the feds, and as a result is fleeing from all sectors of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all kinds of ridiculous situations, from fighting in a Kebab shop to impersonating playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein really intended to make a credible movie here, this man should never be given a camera again. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I was really excited to see this. I love action movies, even if they are cheesy, and especially if they are set in my own backyard. But what was presented to me was a movie with a performance that was awful for the word "go", and continued to do so after the words "For God's sake, stop it!", Subplots were presented and not even mentioned . again after they were outdoors, the characters were thrown for no reason, and the most choreographed fighting scenes that even remotely reflected the real talent of Stan in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless appearances by almost any remotely famous person (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). All the time you are sitting there and playing the guessing game of who is standing there in the background. Too bad that the film relies heavily on the appearances of ex-celebrity seconds. Do you remember those plot holes I told you about? Apparently, Ajax was once locked up, wrongly accused of murdering his wife. Now, we hear that Ajax was in special forces through ONE sentence in the movie WHOLE, and then we left it for the buggery. This is followed by another UNIQUE phrase that convinces Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. Then, get this, in the end, it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is not really dead, but was sold for prostitution. Do we see it? No. Is Ajax going to look for her as soon as he hears this? No. Now it's a marriage! <br /> <br /> Amid all this annoyingly puerile shit, some website described this movie as "a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??". Did this man ever sit down and watch a Jackie Chan movie? Chan shows more dexterity by taking a dumpster than Stan did, well, NOTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the Messiah of the crime movie, and are you comparing him with Salik Silverstein? This movie is more like a mix between "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where does the full title of "Trojan Warrior" come from? The combat skills of Ajax like that of an ancient Greek warrior? No. The unification of the mobsters to find Theo, like that of the Trojan Empire? No. Is it because? wait for that ?? Theo carries a condom with him. Yes, it's true, because THEO IS ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan RUBBER TROYO in his pocket, he's a Trojan WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I had the displeasure of seeing "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as its "special" features: <br /> <br />? Video clip of "Chop Chop", a rap song by Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rape. The funny thing was that Chopper only hit for 30 seconds and then threw it to these two albino teenagers from Doncaster, using words like "dis" and "dope", etc. in its Australian accents. Face it, rap developed in the United States, LEAVE IT NOW! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman in ecstasy had prepared. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the real movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This was not so bad, considering that only 6 or 7 different fights were shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall about 15 times in that 3 minute montage). <Br /> <br /> I do not want to say that this movie contributes to the reason why this country is going to hell when it comes to a movie, but ... oh, wait, I just did it. My advice to anyone reading this is to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", paste them and use them for a paperweight, because this movie is very bad.
