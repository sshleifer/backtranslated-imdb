Buford's Beach Bunnies gives T & A grade B movies a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was appalled to find little effort to exploit the talents of the young actresses. I refer specifically to the clear lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is supposed to be the next generation of sad teenagers who see this on nightly television?
