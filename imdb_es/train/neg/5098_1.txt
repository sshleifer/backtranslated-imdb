This has to be one of the best overrated anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown the "End of the Gospel" and that made me hate it even more. Not to mention the innumerable scams of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not care about the psychological and philosophical interrelationships, but Evangelion drags him into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Apart from that, most of the others were a bunch of weeping weeping losers. They have to go to a psychiatric center, not to fly giant robots against aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even the fuses and the alien fights did not help at all. It's something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they are not really wick, but captured angels, so sometimes they go crazy and they do not do what the underage pilots want, and they have to be controlled better ... blah, blah, blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. Those who like this series very much, well, you have the right to that opinion, I respect you. But for those who have an obsession "out of your mind" to think that everyone will like this series, you are more egotistical. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
