There was no original idea in this story. The themes were extracted from various sources; Some of them are The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter movie) and The Ring. He even presented the same brilliant circle of The Ring and used it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was taken from Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by launching the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing the deep red of Argento. Claiming a tribute would be foolish. This was the bottom of the barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" images in the pot is not a good horror movie. The carpenter used to know that. It should disappear in the dark or acquire a time machine.
