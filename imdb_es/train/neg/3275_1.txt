DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVE CLASSICS LIKE TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL DISAPPEAR TO YOU! First, this movie starts with Bo and Luke executing Moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would never do that in the real series! This film portrays unimaginable characters doing things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respectful of the law. In this film, he is a criminal who is addicted to the moonlight and smoking marijuana with the governor of Georgia. Also, if this was an extension of the meeting of the Dukes of Hazzard. and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: HOW COULD JESSE GET MAINTAINED WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE HAZZARD DUKES ON THE Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG LIVED BEFORE THE MEETING FILM IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? It seems magical that these characters have come back to life, when have they been dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have recovered James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000, and make a family movie with the original live characters they made The show what it was and still compares with this disgusting and dishonorable movie! If you want to watch good Dukes movies, buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy the 2 DVD set that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies. Both star in the original cast, and they are familiar! Do not waste time on a movie that is not worth the CD it is written on!
