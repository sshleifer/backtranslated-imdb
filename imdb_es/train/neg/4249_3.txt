I did not even know that this movie existed until shortly after watching Blade: Trinity was playing on the Trinity board when I saw a user mentioning that the Wes Craven series is much better than the "shit" that is Blade, so I made my quick research: I checked the scores on IMDb and RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and at some point in the search I discovered that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a large number of followers . for this movie, which is a big contradiction with the scores I was seeing. <br /> <br /> Now let's make a brief personal summary here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking anything, and then seeing Dracula's scores: Ascension simply reduced my expectations even more, but again, I'm the kind of person who really needs to watch the movie. (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> A couple of things I learned when I started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so I'm going to have to ignore a lot of v / fx and just think that it will be compensated for by the story and the acting, I was also a little impressed by the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh hell? This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it quite irritable, the bad audio synchronization of the re-recording of the dialogue in SOME scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Of course everyone knew about vampires and some of the basics, Luke even had a book about that, but did that stop them from wanting to 'get infected' on purpose? No, this is worse than the slasher movies where the girl has to get out of the shower and check the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on. <br /> <br /> I must have also blinked at some point, because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' had clothes on his body, especially because he's a big savage and angry and I imagine that if he were in that situation, I would like to be the one wearing it. <br /> <br /> Then the film ends like any intermediate movie in a trilogy? It does not, instead, it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I can now wait for the third installment 'Legacy'. Oh the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
