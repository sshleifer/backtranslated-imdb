What is this shit? My little cousin chose this obviously because of the art and the DVD title too feminine ... I decided to see it with her so she would not get bored, and I'm sure of the horrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was terrible. They look like amateur actresses who read the reference cards. The delivery is inferior to the average and very formulated. The scene cuts were terrible ... it seems that they took it directly from the storyboard, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes were not original nor were they well interpreted, again, very formulaic. I can not count how many times I predicted the next joke. I got a few giggles of the brazenly "subtle" sexual innuendos. The cat, the beaver patch, Hung Wong? .. we go! Just ... stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid, funny. It's just stupid, stupid. It's like a PG movie for children with unnecessary sexual advances, vulgarity and violence to overcome the MPAA rating. Keep away. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> "You could ride in my boat." <br /> <br /> "Oh! I think I stained my blood on the stool!" <br /> <br /> Wrongly played , Sir.
