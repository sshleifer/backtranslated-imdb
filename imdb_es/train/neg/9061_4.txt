What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days before I had seen Lillies and that was one of the best gay movies I've seen in my life. So this was not the best time to see a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was silly and the acting was good. It was not bad enough to turn it off, but it had some bad times and some terrible stereotypes. Nor was it well fused. <br /> <br /> Would you recommend this movie? No, you would be wasting your time and money. I do not understand why movies like these are made and who finances them. Spend your time seeing Noah's bow in the logo instead. I think this is where this movie was trying to go but it never got there.
