When entering a film like me, I expected absolutely nothing entertaining, except for a large number of deaths ... what I got was even less. <br /> <br /> On the eve of Christmas 1947, a child witnesses how his parents did it while Papa is in a Santa suit. Horrified, he climbs the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your usual son every day, due to the fact that he is obsessed with Santa. After his boss mocks him, he goes crazy, disguises himself as a saint and begins to kill customers who are not a saint and his boss. An ungovernable neighborhood catches up with him and, just as they are about to set him on fire, drives his truck down a cliff ... to the moon. It's not the best ending I've seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a boring slow-paced movie that did not really have a redeeming quality, except when Harry went crazy over church goers. There was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were dimmed. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
