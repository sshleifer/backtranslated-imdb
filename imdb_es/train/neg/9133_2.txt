This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it, which means that I am immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlight seems to have for most people. the critics. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler warning) <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting pilot is his basic "caveman and stuffed animal" thread, where a "lovely man" in red blood manipulates a woman mistaken in realizing what you really want and need. The premises on which the "ingenuity" of the script is based must have become obsolete around 1950. It also contains a frankly bad script, as in the scene in which Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of shooting the villain, strictly to prove that It is inept. Woman in need of male help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts to seeing the male chauvinist conspiracy in a simple entertainment, but in this particular case, I am with her: Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped everywhere. <br /> <br /> However, in a certain sense, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that got Willis' work. Both characteristics show the extent to which Willis' surprising ability to act developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Awesome! <br /> <br /> Ranking (and I _am_ a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
