Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner, what he called a very good science fiction movie, Nemesis. So, as we watched this, we found ourselves moving rapidly through the parts of the BS drama just to get to the incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> The character of Gruner is a graduate student who is forced to remain in a ghetto close to the one he grew up with. He is observing the child who lives with him because he really wants to join. In the Mexican gang that continues tormenting his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to defend himself (against a gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays a character typical of Van Damme who kills everyone (or handles them quite badly) and works to rid his member of gang members. <br /> <br /> The plot was very cheesy and easy to think about. It is likely that Gruner is not well known due to his choice of script if this movie is something to compare possible choices. This ghetto is a pure hell and I enjoyed watching the multitude of characters pass through it as if they had a chance against the character of Gruner. The music was typical action music (pianos and kettledrums, swollen guitars) that really was not as bad as I sound it. The director really needed to keep the action in place to take a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> I ultimately gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action movie. for Oliver Gruner to star, but the general feeling of the movie leaves you with more certainty in what you just saw.
