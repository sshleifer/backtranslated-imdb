I passed this title 15 or 20 times while I was in Blockbuster, looking for something decent to watch. All I can say is that everyone went out to the middle of the decent movies the night I decided to rent this. <br /> <br /> I'll give you credit for being better than "Dracula 3000", but in reality that's all. Pretty easy to say, since this one did not have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things that were missing were: an interesting cast, an interesting story, a good dialogue and originality, but I guess you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FORWARD *** The misfit team of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire ... imagine) flew from the mining colony to the mining colony trying to eliminate all the vampires he could find. The crew is composed of: the arrogant, who is not good, the captain (who dies at the beginning), his first officer, although inexperienced, the mentioned vampire hunter vampire (not a typo), a cowboy and a command Asian of REALLY, REALLY killer, "tough guy" female ... it almost sounds like the cast of MTV's "The Real World." After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a crowd of bloodsuckers (and it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of the human anatomy), his first partner takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... all they hate it ... blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said it's the same story used in another hundred 'movies' of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was very active, but of course, if you're expecting him to expose more than his cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say it was the worst movie I've seen, since I rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but wait for it to come on the science fiction channel.
