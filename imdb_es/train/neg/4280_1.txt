This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the dirtiest bodily functions becomes a real nightmare here. In addition, it is evident that man is a misanthrope, he hates the whole world: his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred leaves him blind and he already forgets the profession he knew a long time ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a horrible chain of disgusting images, with no artistic value or professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
