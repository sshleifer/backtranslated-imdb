The black boy becomes a rich white man, and the rich white boy seems to embrace the hip-hop culture, and most of the "fun" moments in this movie are due to this. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> Okay, no one will expect Lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be a lot to ask. I give it to you. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a rich white man who sings rap and completely changes things, playing as if it's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just accept him *. And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white man *, even though he does not care about his money or his power? This is so amazing that it's not even fun. <br /> <br /> I just could not stop the disbelief and I could not finish the movie. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even hard, a couple of times. But I just could not ignore the theme of "white man doing hip hop" that has never been done well in any movie I've seen him try. This was no exception.
