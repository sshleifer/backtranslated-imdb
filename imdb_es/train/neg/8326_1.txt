This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh ... where to start ... <br /> <br /> Plot (what little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart, desperately needs a transplant Clay will He has secretly compromised with the AP of his mother, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night these two are secretly married, it happens that a heart donor is found with the same rare blood type. Go and calculate the odds of that! Once at the operating table, Clay discovers that anesthesia does not work, and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay seems to be able to filter the pain of a sharp scalpel cut. Open your chest simply by concentrating on your memories of Samantha, what you are telling us you are doing through an annoying voice-over that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you did not laugh out loud yet, it will surely start when you see the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire accept that a surgeon, a nurse, a treating doctor and a drunken anesthesiologist perform a heart transplant? There were more people in the room when they removed my wisdom tooth. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too absurd to be taken seriously ... the operating room does not even remain sterile ... people can practically enter and leave the room without even having washed. During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, none of which is too fascinating. Ah ... but this is about ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. Believing that he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. God! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from any other person in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has four malpractice lawsuits against him is performing major cardiac surgery. Not even Clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to verify her condition. The only one who is interested in keeping up is Samantha ... but oh no ... it could be good with Sam ... You will quickly discover it through a Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it would not even matter if Clay underwent anesthesia or not, because the end would have worked out the same way in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe there's some silly fun ... <br / > <br /> Enjoy ...
