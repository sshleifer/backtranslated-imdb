Somehow they summed up the 60s, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And how painful were four hours. They trivialized the main events and events and "affirmed" that they were two families, however, the Afro-American family was hardly seen. If I were from NBC, I would feel ashamed and embarrassed to transmit so much garbage. What was fun was the happy and carefree family they saw at first, was tortured in many ways, but managed to attend all the major events of the 60 throughout the country. And the second family was not such an important factor. They devoted perhaps five or six scenes in total to this family. That poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make movies about other times ... leave it to PBS and the History Channel
