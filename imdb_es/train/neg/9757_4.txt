It is not the best movie to remember Paul Naschy for. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen. Fox would be ashamed! His only salvation came when the competition was equally bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. Without nudity, without blood, without monsters; just an adventure of Robin Hood against an evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. <br /> <br /> The main feature of the film was to see Graciela Nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared in our regrettable loss. Where was he?
