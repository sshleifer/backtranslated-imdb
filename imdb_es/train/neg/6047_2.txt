What made the French connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us jewels like Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau), the film focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession with capturing Charnier (King). The fictitious idea that the New York police would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the local French authorities is to laugh out loud. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier did not jump the city with 65 pounds of pure hit! A street value of 32 million, but yes, we sent Doyle to look for this guy, after all it was his problem. Please!!! The story was weak. The performance was terrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who completely exaggerated his part). The address was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and look at the first installment twice and skip this one.
