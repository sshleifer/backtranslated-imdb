I stopped seeing him lost in this episode because I thought that the deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I discovered that they kept Libby around to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I liked this program for the first season, but it definitely diminished in the second season, I found that the little religious dispute of Jack and Locke was annoying. The death of the characters of Rodríguez and Watros was the final straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode a 4/10, because it is the end of my visualization of this series previously created by Alias ​​legend J.J. Abrams. I hope that your series in the future will improve in this case.
