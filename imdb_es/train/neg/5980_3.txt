There is a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a table in the boardroom wondering what new program to commission. <br /> <br /> 'What about targeting something like 24 or The West Wing?' says one of them, but everyone agrees that it would be too expensive, and cheap television is less likely to damage the station if it fails. <br /> <br /> 'Well, how about we meet some of the best comedy writers and do a quality comedy? Offer another and it is fired on the spot. 'You do not know that good writers cost a lot of money!' The big boss barks. "That's why we invented reality television." <br /> <br /> "We could do another criminal drama ..." suggests a man in a soft suit. "I'm listening ..." the boss replies, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, so let's make another copy of that,' adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> 'But there are too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to make our people stand out?' A naive young man asks and is fired instantly. 'Highlight! If we do that, people can be confused! Let's give them more than they already like! The big boss screams. <br /> <br /> 'Let's just add more violence and make it really creepy, after all, we're Fox', suggests another suit to a sincere response from 'now you understand', from the big boss. "We could turn them into the Deviated Crimes Unit," he continues adding, clearly in a roll. <br /> <br /> 'By Jove, he has it!' the big boss laughs, 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who use very little on the screen'. "Well, that would certainly distract people from average performance and poor scripts," Blandman says. <br /> <br /> 'Then it's solved, we just need a name', announces the big boss. 'Could we call it Police Sexual Violence?' <br /> <br /> 'Too literal, what about Killer Instinct? it transmits violence, but it sounds a bit like Basic Instinct, which had a lot of sex '. <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the big boss responds and then everyone slap each other on the back and go and cancel the Arrested Development.
