A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is little more than an 87-minute video clip that fits a doxen of the composer's works. Instead of dialogue, the film is based exclusively on Young's lyrics, which are strongly linked with socio-political comments, to tell the "story" while the actors represent the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the interpretations of the hammy and the poor quality. From the image, the effect is the equivalent to that Young pops some of his own home movies and launches them for public consumption. Although there is supposedly a "story" in the film, we really have no idea what is going on, mainly thanks to the unpolished aspect of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur ineptitude of the performance. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a group of elderly hippies who make a silent silence through an incoherent narrative, while Young's songs are played endlessly on the soundtrack. Everything becomes a tedious exercise of self-indulgence. "Greendale" gives low-budget films a bad name and outside of Hollywood.
