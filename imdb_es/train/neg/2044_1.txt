This movie is bad. I do not mean 'bad' as in "Oh, the script was bad", or; "The acting in that scene was bad" ... I mean bad, since someone must be held criminally responsible for imposing this pile of smoking halves on an unsuspecting public. I will not even dignify it with an explanation of (Plot ??) if I can refer to it as such. I can only think of another time in about 40 or more years of watching movies that I have found necessary to air. my spleen in a movie I mean, after all, nobody goes out to make a bad movie intentionally, right? Okay, yes. Apparently they do ... and the culprit is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst of all is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! Be advised. Leave this shit where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, accumulating dust.
