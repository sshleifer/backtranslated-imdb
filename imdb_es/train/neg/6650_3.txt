I think this would have been a much better movie if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more credible way. My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never listened to the people I grew up talking about as these people did. The Cajuns were portrayed as hopscotch upside down. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people and do not sound uneducated when they talk about the way they did it. In general, it was a good movie, with a great stage and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and they have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, that the actors study the language, live among the people they interpret and fully understand how they are before they you are trying to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much more fun movie!
