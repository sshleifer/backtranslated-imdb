Oh darling. While Chevy Chase and the gang in SNL reach new highs with the format of presentation of sketches, this fails miserably at all levels. Fortunately, Chevy is hardly into this and can not be blamed for this complete gut. Seriously, it's very, very bad. Although it pretended to be a political commentary on EE. UU At the time of its launch (1974), it is still neither fun nor observed. The sketches are too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost, since they are all on the verge of total boredom. This is credited as the debut in the Chevy movie and I am pleased to say that everything he did after this improved it. Avoid even if it is curious.
