What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Does he really think it's funny? Well, it's funny to see your confidence in being funny. Man has no identity at all ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he strives to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it badly, unevenly, and what comes out are some parts in which he looks like Denzel, with that macho-s ** He acts abruptly and then becomes Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy comedian . There is not a personal touch in all that, I mean that it does not contribute anything to the personality that he tries to sell, and I am sure he has nothing to say personally. It really is Mr. Dull-boy in person. <br /> <br /> I really hoped that Hollywood and the black community in the United States would find someone better to throw themselves into stardom, like Don Cheadle, for example, but maybe the pathetic Jamie represents the generation that remixes the old better.
