The only redeeming quality of this extensive melodrama is the stage of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the main theme. Stephanie Powers is a disaster and betrayed by a false accent. As noted, is she too old to play an 18-year-old girl and look too young like a grandmother with a college-age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good, although she is also not old in her last years. The talented Joanna Lumley is not used and also looks young forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Do not know how any viewer could relate to their excessive representation? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast resemble the rank fans. It is insensitive that the handsome male suitors in this epic remain single as they wait patiently for the subject of their affections to finally accept them. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The commitment of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the section of Provence of France until the end of the war, it was controlled by the French puppet government of Vichy. Do we see the French resistance making an incursion into the light of day in the village of Mistral to steal sheets, after which they all rest under a bridge waiting for a heavy truckload of Nazi troops to surprise them and annihilate them? If you want to see a miniseries of good acting in a foreign country, do not look at the Daughter of Mistral. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
