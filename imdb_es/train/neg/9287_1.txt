WOOHOO! Why would someone make a sequel to a stale movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least I had an idea of ​​what I wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It just exists on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The full movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where there could be a box full of buried gold bricks. In jail, a riot breaks out between the rival prisoners, one of them is shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a conjugal visit, Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg) are abducted by Cortez and are held in an execution room. Burke befriends reluctantly Twitch and end up having problems with idiotic prisoners to discover that Cortez has his loved ones. Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the acting is horrible, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low budget movie, but that's not an excuse for these guys not to try hard at what they do. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. Nobody in this "film can be taken seriously as an actor." Kurupt should feel ashamed of himself.This character "Twitch" is practically a puppet of a thornless troubadour who spends most of his time posing while being surprised by Burke or the Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the film as if he had to take a PHD (big dumpster), the fight scenes are badly choreographed and pathetic, and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when the action is happening! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is a bit decent It stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follywood.
