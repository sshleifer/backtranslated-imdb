What a wasted opportunity to make an interesting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration of what it really feels like to be a heterosexual (or gay) man who works in a gay sexual environment. The dancers talk about their art as if it did not have an erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes hired, but in fact they are sex workers who make fantasies and sell private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film, one would have the impression that they mainly attract women who go to gay clubs and then end up hiring "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show the women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only touch the women in the audience. This is simply not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to make a living doing private dances for heterosexual women and couples. So, what do you really feel about your gay fans and clients? We learn very little. In its place we have stuffing. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of heterosexual dancers. A manager who talks to us about costumes for dragging acts, but does not offer information about the lives and attitudes of the dancers. <br /> <br /> The images of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing the sausage roast is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simplistic movie that should interest only those who want to see some pictures of beautiful guys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
