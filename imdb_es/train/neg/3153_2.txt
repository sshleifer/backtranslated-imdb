I'm a fool for a good romance, but this does not qualify as good or as a romance. I had the plot fixed before the credits ended. With so little dialogue, plot and character development, I suggest investing your hour and a half somewhere else. I had to hurry up and rent Serendipity for the third time so I could get the bad taste out of it.
