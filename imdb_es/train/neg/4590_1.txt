Anyone who has studied physics or cognitive science will be disgusted after 40 minutes, as my wife and I did. The ignorant masses can be entertained by the arguments that renounce the hand and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even an attempt at a logical reason) from real science. I am offended by that nonsense presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the writers took a quantum physics book, they did not understand a word, then they looked at The Matrix about a thousand times and proceeded to write this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, The Washington DC crime experiment was conducted by the Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of its methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
