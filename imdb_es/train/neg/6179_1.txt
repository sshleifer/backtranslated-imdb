This movie is the second worst movie I've seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other important detail required to portray a story. This "movie" is basically another excuse for Toby Keith to show his masculine side and, the "tough guy he really is". I completely lost my time watching this movie. The best part would have to be the final credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut off my thumbs and thrown them to the producers. Whoever in his right mind has given Toby Keith the chance to act in a movie, obviously is on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste time watching this movie, it may be the only thing you regret.
