Sure, I like short cartoons, but I did not like this one. Naturally, children would love it. But, again, I am no longer a child (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is it possible that this dragon of a caricature has been nominated for an Oscar? Well ... I guess it's because people in the 30s were more happy with not much more than now. In the present where we live, everything must go fast. Watch movies today and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. That is really a shame. I wish I had lived in the 30s, because it seems so quiet. But every time it has its ups and downs, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not spill your time on it.
