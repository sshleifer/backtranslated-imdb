The first time I did not want to see this film, because the trailer gave the impression of a common and long-awaited movie ... but as I recently had the pleasure of discovering the amazing "Mensonges et trahsons et plus si affinité", which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (scriptwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And absolutely not. The script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, as bored as she usually is) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac And, to be honest, still I do not understand how such shit can be so successful, even with such a casting ... Anyway, the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting arguments, but it's not so good. as "Mensonges ..." by Tirard, although it is also written by him. It's an easy, surprising and lazy job. Totally overestimated!
