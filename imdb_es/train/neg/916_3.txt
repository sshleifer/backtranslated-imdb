Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the proper chemistry here in this 1945 movie. <br /> <br /> Here's a good story about the Axis trying to get coal to use in the next war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly evil Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real recognition of the performance goes to the veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the Oscar winner of 1943, "For whom the bells play", Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a double cross against a spy for the Francoist group. She is a pretty vicious character here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old boy out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
