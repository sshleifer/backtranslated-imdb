It did not take me long here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is amazing. I have the 3 on DVD, I added them to my collection of movie sets on DVD. Darkman is among the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There are not too many good horrors, thriller, it gets there. Thank you very much to the whole team, and ready to give us the trilogy of Darkman. By the way if you wonder how I came across this on DVD. I bought it over the Internet, however, it's region 4, since most of the US DVD players. UU They are from Region 1. If you have a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it is a player from all regions. Simply go to configure and then choose the witch region settings you want (1-9).
