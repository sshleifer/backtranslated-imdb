I have never seen the oldest version of 1973, highly qualified. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, well acting as always). It is likely that this film took five minutes to make the whole plot (I can see it is done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner), if you can not find the end of this slob in the first thirty minutes, you will probably find this movie entertaining . This is, lately, the terrible routine that Hollywood seems to have disregarded with the genre of horror / mystery / suspense, unable to give enough credit to the public and write a new script, intelligent and tempting, that deliver spooky music and add a couple of things to skip a bit and then send the final impression to your local theater. At least, I did not have the hand-held camera syndrome shaking.
