Never launch models and Playboy bunnies in your movies! "Star 80" by Bob Fosse on Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her young husband, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see a kind of lost masterpiece to Orson Welles, but instead I got Audrey Hepburn to appear in jeans and a frightening "poodlesque" hairstyle ... Very disappointing ... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could see again and again. This pot I could barely sit once. This movie supposedly was not released due to the problems that surrounded the death of Mrs. Stratten; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
