I would give this film 5 instead of 3 if it were at least in time ... When I first saw it, it was just what I could expect from work that is not based on the artistic abilities of the directors. but in the idealist or I prefer to say idiotic habits of our government (Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was filming good movies when he was not honored with the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually ran by him . Movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after the death of Aimanov, the production of quality films was reduced almost dramatically in 10 years, there were very few films produced. However, at the end of the 1980s, 'Assa' was filmed, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the great country, a year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov filmed another film with the co-protagonism of the same actor / singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a legend of Russian / Soviet rock, - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something like that) was completely new, someone called that period a resurrection or a new wave of Kazakh movies. Unfortunately, today we do not have quality films, our directors film films in French and Japanese financial support, and therefore the films are not for the public, but for the professional critical authors, some of them take a price in the International film festivals of authors, but very few of them become products of business assets ... And, again, we return to our "nomads". Such films are often unpopular due to the vast aspects. The same effects occurred with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about the Russian Tsars, which was also shot in parities with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in Russian audiences it became a main theme of comedians and comedies like 'KVN'. In my humble opinion
