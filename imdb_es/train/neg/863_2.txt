I have noticed to see Euro horror, especially the films made by the cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can not expect a plot that makes much sense. However, Franco has exceeded this movie; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the movie's reputation as one of the director's best, Succubus is a truly horrible movie. I must admit that I saw the American cut version, which lasts about 76 minutes; but unless only the logic has been cut, I am sure that the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman hanging around; practice S & M and talk trash, and everything is really boring. There is no gore and sex is boring, and most of the execution time is occupied by boring dialogues and, although it is a short film; I had difficulties to get to the end. I must say that the places look good and Franco has done a good job using his surreal atmosphere; But the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who has made some classic movies of garbage, but it seems that it was one that he did for money, and in general I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's most interesting works.
