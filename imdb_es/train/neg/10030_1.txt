Tashan: the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> These types of movies are actually made for the flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces those worthless movies that grade C movies. Or even some C grade movies have a better and more enjoyable story than Tashan. Tashan, the overly hyped and overconfident, was badly bombarded at the box office he certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made with the banner of the honorable Yash Raj Films. How is it that you handled such a heavy project for the new Vijay Krishna Acharya that he has no real sense of making the action unfold? He tried to imitate Dijon's ways of doing things like those of Sanjay Gadhvi, but finally he suffered. The action scenes are more like comics or cartoon movies made to exhaust the public. <br /> <br /> History also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the hearts of the public. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the South Tamil star, Rajnikant, in his body language and verbal expressions. I'm not a fan of Saif or Akshay, but the Kareena prize should finally have gone to Saif's hand instead of to Akshay. Only from the point of departure, I expected that, but in the end I disliked the truth of the climax. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in between. In any movie, the final must be judged with all the characters in the whole story and the prize or prize must be awarded to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a success. <br /> <br /> Akshay's has nothing new to show her comedic talent here, but she still remembers her previous films. He really needs to form a new image for his fans that impresses them again and again. Between Saif he did a great job in Race, and now he came back again in his hilarious nature through this movie. But it has developed fully in the field of acting. And last but not least, about Kareena. She looks really sexy with the bikini dress that some complain about when she became too thin. But I do not think so either, instead she became thin. Yes slim! It is a good factor for a woman to attract the main people (or, for example, the man). Beside them, it is good that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appears at the beginning and finally as the young Saif. I hope that now he also leans towards the goal of making acting his career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this Tashan are mentally immature or want to go back to childhood, or say they want to be admitted to an asylum. A thumbs down to newcomer director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In the future, you should experiment and study the script for a minimum of 5 years before going to practical instructions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to rate the good stars for this kind of junk movies.
