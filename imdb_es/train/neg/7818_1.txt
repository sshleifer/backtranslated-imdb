Normally I do not leave a movie, but halfway I did it. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking that I had not seen that before. Spoiler alert! Back in 1, the spacecraft crashes and lands on earth, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board, this thing still manages to burn and crash! What, it seems that this advanced civilization can not develop a landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we can see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks, please! Superman runs saving people, making sure that he adheres to Europe and the United States, please do not go to dark areas. Maybe I could handle this about 30 years ago, but now now.
