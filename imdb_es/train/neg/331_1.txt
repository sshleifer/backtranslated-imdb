I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, an aspiring comedian who works on a cruise. That is the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy man's breakfast, and not in a rampant way with a naked gun, but rather frustrating, "throw both shoes at the TV class." Even General Noriega makes an appearance, without any reason he can understand (certainly not because of humor). Add to the mix, Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian accent I've heard, and has something I will not call the worst movie ever made, because going overboard does not even fit the basic definition of a movie. I recommend watching this movie, as it will raise the reputation of every bad movie you see. I guarantee that the first thing you will say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least it was not as bad as going overboard".
