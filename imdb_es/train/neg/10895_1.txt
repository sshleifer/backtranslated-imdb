I have seen many bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a horrible horror movie for what it is. But this really brings the evil to new extremes. <br /> <br /> It's tasteless, the plot of what really never goes anywhere and takes your time about it. No shocks, no horror, no suspense, just a load of guys rubbing for an hour and a half and then a quick end. <br /> <br /> A plague in the horrible horror genre, avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br />
