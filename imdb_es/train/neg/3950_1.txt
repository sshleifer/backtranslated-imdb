Previously I did not know that in the early 1990s, Devry University (or was ITT Tech?) Added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical study programs. Well, this movie must have been the product of the valedictorian class. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Horrible horrible horrible <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has been dreaming of the character of Boogeyman and his victim since the first movie. More than 50% of this movie is in stock from the original movie. The rest of the film is the main character who has the bad dreams, while his therapist drone in the narrator. These scenes are filtered through a filter so thick that the characters shine. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So, to recap, horrible. Do not watch this movie.
