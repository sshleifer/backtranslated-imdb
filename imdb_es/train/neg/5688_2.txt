Short version: The seed is not useless. It is only derivative and inferior. And without a soul <br /> <br /> Long version: if you've never seen any of the movies that comprise the vaguely defined genre of "psychological horror", this movie will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The initial montage of real animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of brutality in the video, and the (only) memorable blood scene later in the movie may be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other movie has. <br /> <br /> But that's if you do not have much experience with the genre. If you have seen something real ... "The Penance of August Underground", for example, you will find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other Reviewers have compared this with the unpleasant videos of antiquity. I understand this comparison. As in the video nasties, "Seed" is more violent than a conventional and less subtle horror film. But the reason we still know about malicious videos is not just for the above reasons, since those that are still popular had something special. Allow me to be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who have stayed with "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Burial Ground", in an interview on the new - DVD: "... we will never have more movies like these, because today, technology has The imagination is surpassed, and the technology is cold, many things will disappear because small films like these will no longer be produced, Today we have great and exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold, today a horror and horror movie This guy costs more than a million dollars, these movies were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands ". <br /> <br /> It may be wrong to take the comparison with the old school horror so seriously. But Crisanti has hit the nail in the head. Even in its most exploitative aspect, the best thing about video nasties was to pursue a primitive "truth". And this is where Boll falls short. It is as if I had seen the movies and I would not have understood them. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS about "making a statement about humanity," a scene of obscene torture, etc. But it is, as Crisanti says, "cold." The gore is all CGI. Everything feels like scenes composed of other films of various genres. And the pace is very slow. Man, very slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the only gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, pretty BS. Weak movie
