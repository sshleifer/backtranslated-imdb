"They Are Among Us" is, at best, a poor science fiction. The mediocre performance bogs down this movie. The holes of the plot are numerous. Foreigners who somehow came to earth in a meteor and have been hiding among us for more than 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to make them look human. In their alien form, they supposedly have exo-skeletons (so they need plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and nails. The father of the heroine "disappeared" after the Blue Book Project was closed, but he was supposedly an F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to watch an alien invasion movie, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", and see how it is done correctly.
