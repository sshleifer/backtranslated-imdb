Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo excursion! This time, the inevitable Fred Olen Ray brings you! As for the exploitation films, this does not click! As science fiction, it is simply unoriginal! All we see is a female and ugly android who wears a bikini to destroy the Earth and shows everything that is almost naked to resist. Give me a break! If this type of entertainment is your thing, why not dust off those old swimwear magazines SI from the attic for a change? This would have been much better if I had not established the deafness factor at a very high level, but that would not make this one great. I would like to point out another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why first-rate first-person "femme fatale" action films do not translate well in the United States. I'm sorry, friends!
