Steven friend, remember when you said this: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others, live with integrity and morality, not only with people but with all beings". <br /> <br /> You have not been doing that, you have mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these "movies". I would not even bother if I did not know you're much better than this. I have seen the videos of your teachings, you are much better than this, why brother, why ... <br /> <br /> Steamroller productions have been overwhelmed. I promise brother, I'm not afraid of you. I'll tell you the following. The truth to your face so we can fix it. <br /> <br /> Well, I like that others fell asleep by 90%, but to be fair, I was tired and had a great meal just an hour before Sensai, what are they? you do 12 millions? Really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000? It could have been in theaters and a blockbuster, if you wanted, we could have donated money from the huge profit to a homeless shelter or something like that. These post-production people are stealing the man, the choreography did not exist, we can do better, the flickering of the men in the black movie, I almost expected Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to say they were guts. no eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal you are a master of Aikido, why are you doing this to yourself, to us? when you appeared on the scene, you had such a cool direct style, and it was obvious that you are a teacher because the way your movements were so clear and clear, to see your first three movies, I felt that you were teaching me something, now I feel that only You are being scammed or something that I feel I need to save you, this time you are the murdered one and I am going to take revenge on you helping you to make the best movie in history. Brother, I know who you really are, I know the truth about Nico's movie. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me, I have some new ideas. I am a nit collector, I swear to you that you will not be disappointed with my attention to details and we will do it for the fanatic, your admirers. we deserve something better, we cling, but the chain is about to break. I swear I'm not going to let your movie go out the door with a single mistake. I'm still trying to find out if that was the worst dubbing ever, or if you have laryngitis, but I promise you I can make a better impression of your Voice than the lame cripple who did not even try. I hope you kicked it in the nuts as payment. I can invent a story and a plot that can be adapted to your revenge for the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house plant niche and I promise that we will bring you back, I promise, I also want to go to the address , that makes people think, if you let me in, I promise you that we will make a film in which people will leave and have to have a discussion about it, an experience that stimulates seriously and that alters perception. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal. This is my official written permission for IMDb to reveal my contact information for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen, for non-Italian, Spanish and Jewish registration. you call it a bad performance, I call it a great performance, because you've believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) a little changes your perception, right?
