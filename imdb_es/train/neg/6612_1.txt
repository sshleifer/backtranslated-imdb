Yesterday I downloaded this movie through an Internet site, the quality was quite good! I was watching the movie with great expectations (although I knew it was a failure), especially because the movie has the superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain. Although at least actors like him had done something of value for their roles. But unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan could not impress as a villain, this proved that nobody can compete in the magical judgment of Rgv of AMJAD KHAN to rekindle the counterproductive past. Sholay, the previous one is a milestone in Indian cinema with a cast of stars, cult dialogues, an elegant cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is also a success for current generations. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS was wasted and his acting was average. Prahant Raj, a newcomer does not know what it is to act. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have. I do not know how he is still in the RGV team, Urmila & Abhishek, seen in a song without enthusiasm and passion. Mohanlal did everything possible and Susmitha Sen's work was good. work in this movie It was a total butchery of the original Sholay
