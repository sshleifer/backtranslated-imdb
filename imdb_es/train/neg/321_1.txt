Shecky, it's a damn legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK high-fidelity and video retailer, directing its testing department. We would go through many new entrants, we would expect them to learn to find the various detritus that come back as non-functional in one way or another from the stores. Now, to test the resolution of these new staff members, we will send you a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because every time someone who had purchased a particular model of a Goodmans DVD player who had this movie as a free gift, he was able to return his DVD player, they never stopped returning Shecky. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test faults on these machines until they have found one or two of their own drives to test. <br /> <br /> Now, as to why this movie is so bad. , Where do I begin? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be very, very funny, like in Happy Gilmore, or the wedding singer, must have had a very bad day. The rest of the crew sucked, and what about Billy Zane? His name appears in several of the worst movies of all time, and is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would have been inclined to give him a zero if he could, because they did not even have the guts to call him by his full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Still, it's worth a watch so you can see how far Sandler has come and how low you can get.
