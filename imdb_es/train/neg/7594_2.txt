Given the story of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that it was such a painfully bad movie. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there. The movie was still to be seen and, boy, had been surprised. I have not read the book on which it is based, nor do I know if it was highly rated or appreciated, but I have read "Captain Correlli's mandolin" and, given how badly it adapted to the screen and how bad this movie was, I can only I suppose something similar has happened here. The performance was not bad, although there was a pair of Farrell's raised eyebrows. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared about any character in this movie. The situations are reproduced on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. The part of Donald Sutherland includes some scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I was not cramped by the dialogue on the screen. I never left a movie, but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons that seem terribly superficial, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the very short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek undressed and looked beautiful. I can not say anything positive about this movie. Do not ask anything to dust, can not talk!
