I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I learned that a film based on the book was being prepared. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it. It was because he did not capture what I loved about the book: Erica, absolutely ridiculously funny, and the interesting way she sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I realized that things were not right. It is not the same as what I had imagined in the book. So, I just went for the ride. It was not so bad, I suppose. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I had imagined it would be! I did not think she would smoke and drink. Jean Kittson, who plays it, is very funny! <br /> <br /> By itself, I thought that the film and its actors / actresses did a good job. I work, but, unfortunately, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books of all time) that I could not help feeling disappointed = P
