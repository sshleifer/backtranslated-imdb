Horrible. I see many comments from users about how good this show is. It really is an imitation of Wanna-Be-Friends, made in Taiwan. The jokes are lame as ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably shrinking when they hit those horrible bash lines (if you can call them that). Most of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet (or at least from another continent). Obviously, there are reasons why television companies cancel programs ... and none of them is when the programs work well. Make sense? Anyway, stay away, even if it's raining and there's absolutely nothing else to do on this planet ... go in the rain instead, more fun.
