This has the worst absolute performance of Robert Duval, who sounds like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic performance takes away any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate or unintentional stealing of scenes, but it's the only thing I can remember of a truly forgettable movie. This image must be shown in each amateur actor class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to achieve a cultured accent. He is a good character actor, but that's it. Klaus is much better. His performance is mute and worthy of mention.
