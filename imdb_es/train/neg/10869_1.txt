A friend of mine lent me this video and I was quite excited to see it, but after ten minutes of the slow voices of James Hetfield and Lars beating his drums in what seemed like slow motion, I started thinking, "Why? Seeing this? That question will be italicized through your minds in 5? 10 minutes after you hit Play.I returned the tape to you the same day, as you would suspect, it's not worth buying it or seeing it! <br /> < br /> Only my opinion! <br /> <br />
