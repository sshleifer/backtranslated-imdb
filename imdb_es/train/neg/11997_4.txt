This movie has many disadvantages and that's all I could see. It is painfully long and terribly directed. I could see the whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end. the execution time is more than 3 hours, which could have been edited less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is average. Most people confessed to being in the seats waiting for something better to come out. <br /> <br /> It's funny just in your pockets. Ambitious project and execution below par. Govinda does a good job, anil kapoor disappointed me, rest as we expected. If you're expecting something like Babel or Love, then it's not close.
