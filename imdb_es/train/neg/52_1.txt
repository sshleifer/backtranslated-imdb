I was thrilled to see a film from Catalonia in the Berlin contest. But after the presentation I felt totally disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like all wars, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, nothing pleasant, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as in the relationships between homosexuals and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo tragedy that may belong to the worst of the film's history. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not advise anyone under any circumstances to go see this movie.
