In my opinion, the title of this film should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to a screening of this movie a few months ago and I was quite disappointed in the result. Although I appreciate that the director has made a film about the men of the 442nd, a topic that for a long time deserved to be addressed in the film industry, the performance in some parts of the film was quite stagnant. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director should never have put himself as the main character in the film. I'm sorry Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stick to what you are good at acting in the theater. The performance of Gina Hiraizumi in this movie was also horrible. He should never have given her a role to speak and her appearance was not adequate to play the role of Queen Miss Nisei. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were not they chosen for that role? Another important problem with this movie was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to be fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Of course, this was a low-budget feature, but since it was a war-based movie, is not it important to show some fighting? This movie was a valuable attempt, but definitely not worth an important distribution.
