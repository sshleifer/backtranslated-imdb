There are many pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with a beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me do not "understand" it. Obviously, this means that we should stick to the Hollywood scum. <br /> <br /> It has all the artistic clich√©s of a hem, I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen ones. Almost a parody car that drowns in its own pretension. <br /> <br /> The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) film 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece that wallows in artistic nonsense; It is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating to its viewers.
