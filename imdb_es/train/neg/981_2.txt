As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) see this image very, very boring. It's Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start. The story is tremendously boring, and it involves a theme that, in itself, bores me: religious guilt. (Who needs it?) Suffice it to say, perhaps, of all Dietrich's films (and the one I've seen most, including "Pittsburgh"), this is the only one in which even his performance is hardly worth seeing. Color photography is fine (this is a very early version of Technicolor), but without any purpose. Ridiculous cast: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (has enough been said?). The only thing of interest is John Carradine's extravagant caricature of a performance like "The Sand Diviner", which predicts everything that will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Another example of the inflated reputation of David O. Selznick (did he ever make a really good movie? Apart from That One?) And, to a final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a disaster, with levels of seemingly randomized volume Very little recommended.
