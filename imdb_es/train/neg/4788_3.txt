In the third inning of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to chase the tall man, assisted by a happy 9-year-old trigger, a G.I. black. Jane and the spirit of Mike's late brother (died in the original Phantom). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the black and black comedy is much less inspiring and exciting as it was on Phantasm II. I got the feeling that the stress was limited to Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. The humor in the previous film was much drier and oppressed, which fits better in a story like this. Also, the configuration is not so macabre here, plus the constant presence of the tall man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious. There is still a lot of blood, but not half as satisfying this time. By the way, be careful with the severe cut version, as it shows the most delicious killings off the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifelong achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far: the fifth is in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a party of terror of blood and violence and the rest can easily be omitted. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, even though James LeGros represented his character much better in Phantasm II.
