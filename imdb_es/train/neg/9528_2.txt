There is a lot of talk about torture these days. That's all this movie is. It is a good person who makes a bad decision. Due to her kindness, she becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on it is a fair assault for him. I do not know at what point you do something about it. There is a wife and a son somewhere; He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been some moments when he could have acted. The movie seems to be a joke from someone. I suppose that in the aftermath of the Manson murders, we had a little fixation on the tastes of these two. However, why would someone make a movie like this? What resources do you have except for sadism? The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but that could have been remedied with an obvious twist of the plot. Oh good. Another hour and a half of my life.
