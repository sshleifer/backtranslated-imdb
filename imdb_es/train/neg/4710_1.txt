My brother is in love with this show, let's clarify this. I completely agree with the people who said that they were copying Dexter's lab and quite strange parents. <br /> <br /> I have never liked pretty strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's downright annoying and not at all cute. This is almost the same as I feel about Johnny Test. Except, NOTHING makes me laugh in that program. The gags are so stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but children do not dress like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but come on! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, which used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching it. What makes me feel disgusted and ashamed that Johnny Test has made a real JOY of that wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. It is. So. Annoying. He is louder and more disagreeable than Johnny! And the gay accent? What the fudge! I hate the dog until death and I hope he dies, because it would be better if the children saw him instead of listening and seeing the nasty shit that happens in that show and acquiring a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyeballs to burn in miraculous flames and your brain go crazy from this show, do not look at it!
