This film has many associated problems that make it come out as a low-budget class project of someone at the film school. However, I have to give him credit in his campiness. Many times throughout the film I found myself laughing hysterically. Sometimes it was so bad it was funny, which made it a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low intensity film with a touch of psychological horror and a hint of ridiculous ridicule, then open a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time and the soundtrack is simply there.
