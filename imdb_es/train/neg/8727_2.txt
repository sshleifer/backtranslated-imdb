Let me start by saying that I can enjoy almost any Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation movie of the 70s. Seriously. This was downright horrible. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them works (except for the croc-gone-wild) very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, who establish a place in the jungle somewhere. I do not even remember where it takes place ... how sad it is ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its "ceremonies", but finally they upset the "crocodile god" of the river, which then It proceeds to a fuss, killing the vacationers and also some members of the tribes. It sounds good, yes? Well, do not give yourself any illusions. There is a minimum of violence to the end, the special effects are so bad that it was as if they had been held in a kindergarten class and the love story that was launched is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Seriously, there are some scenes in which they appear to appear. On top of a camera underwater in a pool and launched a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that is supposed to be the attack of the crocodile. I'm not kidding. In another marvelously elaborate special effect, a Matchbox van is run by the incredible plastic caiman that sinks, and suddenly it's five times bigger than a truck. (A few minutes ago, it was only big enough to eat a human, but now dwarfs a full-size cargo van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other film that occurs to me where the effects were so bad that they took me out of the story was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, "Rats", with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all those who COULD NOT be terrified. <Br /> <br /> Normally, I would say Sergio Martino was a solid to be seen, but this is a mandatory pass. A waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + price of No Shame. This is a shame. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
