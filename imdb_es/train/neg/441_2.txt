We do not have this on television in England, but I did it on the Internet on YouTube. It's silly, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into that caricature, but I must admit it better than this. The cartoonist has not done anything for years. For Doug TenNapel, this is a farce back and a historical minimum. The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money from their dead old teacher. They are argumentative and still disagree on what they want to spend their money. "BORING"! The animation is terrible. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats at all! Only strange creatures with the appearance of animal monsters with big mouths, pointed teeth and protruding eyes! Human characters and other animals are also drawn ugly! The subject of the subject is terrible and irritating! The stories are also boring and most likely copied from previous programs. I was surprised how this program got 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not really what it used to be! But now most of them are silly, cheap and boring. Some of you on the website might not agree with me, I'm sorry, but this is a total waste of money and a total and absolute loss of your time and I'm glad that Britain has not tolerated this shit (oh yes If you have digital you have to do it, but I do not, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get that because I've given other worst shows!).
