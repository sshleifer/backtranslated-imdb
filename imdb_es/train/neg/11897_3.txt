William Lustig's follow-up to "Maniac" proves conclusively that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and Spinell's convincing performance, "Maniac" would never have become the cult success he had. "Vigilante" is misdirected, with a simple script that explains everything and is predictable at all times, and also mediocre performances by all the actors. Judging by the sense of "deja vu" that gave me this movie, Lustig had seen "Death Wish" several times before doing this. (* 1/2)
