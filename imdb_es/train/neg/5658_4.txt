"Laugh, Clown Laugh", released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a sheath (a beautiful young Loretta Young) to adulthood and calls her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the life of the circus and has become an accomplished dancer. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not ignore the fact that Tito, who is already in middle age, has much interest in the young Simonetta. Although not her biological father, she has raised her as a daughter. That kind of "ick" factor permeates the entire movie. Tito competes for the affections of Simonetta with a handsome young 'Conde' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls in love with the young man, but feels guilty for abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito how silly the old man is (until he reveals it himself at the end). The movie is notable only for Loretta Young, who would have a great career. While I love Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this entire movie seems a bit creepy to me.
