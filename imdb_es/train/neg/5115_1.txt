This had to be one of the worst movies I've seen, I'm 64 years old and I'm a soccer fan. I was expecting to see a football movie. At about 10 minutes, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly acting) could have gotten into a theater. Halfway there, I whispered to my husband that it was horrible and he explained the facts behind the movie. Although I was a bit offended (and I can see how some might be VERY offended if they were not Christians) by being preached in a movie theater, it was not a big problem. However, it was a big problem to be subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, to the quality of the performance. It is an appropriate film for an exit from the church, but it is shown in an auditorium of the church and not in a theater. I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to a movie? No. Would you recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
