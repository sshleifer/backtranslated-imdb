Sean, you know, I think you're the best actor in the world, but I can not congratulate you on this. Comedy is not your strong point. <br /> <br /> However, it was not all your fault. Some of the things were too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to ask where the lines came from right from the start. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
