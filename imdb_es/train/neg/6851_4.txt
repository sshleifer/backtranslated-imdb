Feh This movie started in an interesting way, but quickly went from confused to boring. The confusing parts occurred mainly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that it is difficult to say what happens during the first twenty minutes or so. The boring comes later, with a warm romance between the two living people (both pusses). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most animated person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast had lived up to its caliber, the movie could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story becomes really interesting for a while, since it seems that the crazy priestess mother of the dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from death, with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all the rest Dead people come back too, take a solid human form, and most likely you start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystical thing from the Night of the Living Dead. But this does not happen. Although this shaggy, unwashed priest with a small basket tied to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter. There is no mass uprising of the dead, there is no walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest simply makes the spirit of the girl return to the land of the dead, taking her boyfriend with her, since he had crushed her spine like a brittle peanut (at that moment I was tempted to cheer myself out loud, like in this case). The idiot came to kiss and caress the DEAD girl, ewwww !!!). Robitussen sucks, the best friend without thorns has a long introspective shot at the end when she leaves town for the last time, and that's it. There is no real horror, no real chills, what the Japanese tend to do much better than American filmmakers with their emphasis on the exaggerated face-to-cheese makeup, without screaming mimics. I was very disappointed.
