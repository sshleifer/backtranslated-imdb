This is not really a zombie movie, if we are defining the zombies as the walking dead. Here, the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by an incredibly young Dean Jagger), gets control of a method to create zombies, although in fact, his "method" is to mentally project his thoughts and control the minds of other living people turning them into Hypnotized slaves. . This is an interesting concept for a film, and Fritz Lang did it much more effectively in his' Dr. Mabuse 'movies, including' Dr. Mabuse the Gambler '(1922) and' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse '(1933). Here, unfortunately, is subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his ex-fianc√©e, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche with a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone), which is really the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing start, as Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the zombie cult that came from there. In some kind of complex (where we get large sets of 30 years and clothes) he announces his commitment to Claire, and just five minutes later, she returns the ring that declares his love for his friend, Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland). It is involuntarily fun the way they talk without making eye contact. This would have been a great movie for 'Mystery Science Theater 3000', if they had not roasted it. <br /> <br /> It has never been shown how Louque really learns the secret of 'zombification', but then uses it. To kill your enemies, create a giant army of rifles with soldiers and bodyguards. We will not see such force of will until John Agar in 'The Brain From Planet Arous' (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally, Claire agrees to marry him if he lets Greyson live and returns to America. Louque agrees, but actually makes him one of his hypnotized slaves. On the wedding night, he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his "powers". To win his love, he does it, provoking the "revolt" of the title, in which all his slaves wake up, attack his compound and kill him. Greyson embraces Claire, and it seems we are at the end of a parable: "Whom the gods would destroy, first they get angry." <br /> <br /> Then really, it's not as bad as in a movie, despite the low IMDb rating it currently has. In repeated views (?) You can see the art in the well-formed script! Dean Jagger had not yet become a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youth. Is it really your own hair? We remember him more for his bald and old roles in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). The story borrows many of his basic themes from the Halperin brothers, the previous film 'White Zombie' (1932) in which Robert Frazier (as Charles Beaumont) uses 'zombification' to win the love of Madge Bellamy (as Madeline Parker ). <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!) I would start with 'White Zombie' (1932), 'King of the Zombies' (1941), 'I Walked with a Zombie' (1943), 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968), 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) and its two remakes. In the modern era of classy films, there is' Horror Express' (1972), 'The Serpent and the Rainbow' (1988), '28 Days Later '(2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many, others also Many to mention. <br /> <br /> This is not really a zombie movie. Judging this movie on its own terms, it is more like a semi-gothic romance. As such, it is located a little below some of the Universal B horror films of the late 30s and early 40s. So I will give you a 5.
