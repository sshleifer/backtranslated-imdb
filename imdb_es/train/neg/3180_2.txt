What a boring movie! To summarize, it was basically just Nana Patekar beating her daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she was trying to flee the village with her son. Can anyone say boring? The concept was not so bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locations, and some of the town scenes were very well filmed. However, in general the cinematography was short. The story could have been great, but the movie seemed to go on. There is only so much stupidity that a person can stand, let alone three hours of bleeding. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", and that only lasted five minutes. Other than that, this movie was a piece of shit.
