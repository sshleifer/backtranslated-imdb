With a title like this, you know you have a lot of garbage. Acting wrong Wrong script. Bad director. Bad grammar <br /> <br /> The movie makes a lot of noise that really is not music and a lot of people scream. Film make bad racial stereotype. Why do all the movies come with a black hero addicted to drugs? Why come hero always have to dance to succeed? Why does the famous rapper always have to be in the dance movie? Why the letter "s" can not be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood has to stop the silent audience and make films that have people with brains who know how to speak English correctly. <br /> <br /> Do your own favor and do not go see.
