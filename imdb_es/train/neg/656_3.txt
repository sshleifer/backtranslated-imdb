Note: I could not force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. It just can not be done. Instead, I went through what I thought while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I thought about as I watched Grad Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, just for the main character to wake up just before she bites him. Of course, when I say "complicated deaths," I mean throat cuts or stabbings in the stomach. Did not Dallas ruin the whole "it's just a dream" thing? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple of stabs in the stomach will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> -The movie is only ten minutes away and I can already tell the horror clich√©s in two hands. It is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> -even after meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I am convinced that he will die. Does anyone want to bet? <br /> <br /> -The killer in this movie is a teacher who is obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think "Donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) She spends three years in a maximum security prison before escaping and finds Donna celebrating her prom at school high school. While tastes are not taken into account, I really wonder who will take all that time to stalk someone as bored as Donna. <br /> <br /> -Secondary schools allow graduation dances to be held in hotels and students are not tracked. Apparently, students can buy a hotel room and go in and out whenever they want. I suppose if this plot point were not in place, the movie would consist of 90 minutes of people getting bored with their minds and chewing the dust randomly each time they went to the bathroom. I guess the compensation for your excitement is my total boredom with everything. I've already played "count the pieces of chewed gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only at the 20 minute mark. How else will I entertain myself? <br /> <br /> -Note to yourself: Do not forget milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> -Dreamy Warden: You've used enough false swords to finish this movie and all the other horror remakes this year. <br /> <br /> -The 1980 version of this movie was not so good, but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. He had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his many horror films after Halloween and had a little "twist" at the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she acted more. <br /> <br /> - Apparently at the graduation party there is not much dancing. Instead, the girls fight with their boyfriends about where they plan to attend college. I hear that all these universities are educated by name, and I can not help wondering who these girls have to cheat on the entrance exam to enter. <br /> <br /> -The murderer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning products and clean his mess between the scenes. That is the only logical explanation for why he could stab someone on the carpet or in the bathroom and, by the time someone steps into the hotel room, there is no trace of struggle. (On another note: this is a very lazy killer.) Michael Myers went hunting his victims, he just said it.) <br /> <br /> -It's official: the whole audience in the theater is encouraging the killer. What caused it? Was it when every time Donna returned to her hotel room while the sirens went off and ordered everyone out of the building? Were her dreams constant, and how, even after going through something dramatic in that dream, did she insist on re-enacting her steps towards a T-shirt? Or was Brittany Snow's unconvincing performance? I'll have to say that it was all of the above. <br /> <br /> -Well, who had "he dies off the screen in the third act"? You won the pot <br /> <br /> -Finally, the movie ended. My friend turns to me and says: "Donna was not too smart". That is the underestimation of the week. It's like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a power cut of a week is a small inconvenience. <br /> <br /> -I can not wait to take Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave this move a review that favors. <br /> <br /> -I can not recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This is a horror movie as lazy as any, and the only way to enjoy its cheese-smelling plot is if it is under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theater clients, alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
