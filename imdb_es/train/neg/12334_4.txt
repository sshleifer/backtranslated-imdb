The premise is ridiculous, the characters incredible, the dialogue trite and the absurd end. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a Kevin Kline fan, but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours like a supposed Frenchman is not as fun as it seems. <br /> <br /> For her part, Meg Ryan is, once again, as cheerful and adorable as (chooses): Kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the cutest creature in the earth. In addition, it has no resemblance to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me an opportunity that the friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline took to go on vacation to Paris and the south of France, while they are well paid. that. So I really can not blame them.
