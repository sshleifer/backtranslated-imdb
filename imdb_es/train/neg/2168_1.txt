After reading another review, I thought that this movie would be really good. I enjoy "B" movies, but this could not even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only half decent thing in the movie. But the edition left a lot to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose music and sound did a terrible job. The music was horrible, especially any atmospheric setting or scene. If the performance had been better, they could have taken the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn movies. If you want to see a vampire movie "B", check out 'Blood Ties'. You will be much more entertaining.
