I'm glad to have rented this movie for a reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Advantages: the film is beautiful, the period is well represented and consistently (as far as I know), and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs. <br /> <br /> Cons: This is the worst acting job I've seen in Jeremy Irons. I was wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the horribly English way it says "Transit"). Winona Ryder does not do anything credible, except that she looks young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are fine, but very few things come together in the arcs of the characters and in the development of the relationship that I felt frustrated and angry before the end. <br /> <br /> Now I'm very curious to know if this movie is typical of Bille August's work. You may have to leave another couple of dollars to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.
