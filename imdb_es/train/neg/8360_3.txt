What do I like about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> It has an impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well sometimes! <br /> <br /> Then 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music speeds up! Especially when the shark or the bad guys are about to move! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's slow! As to convey to the audience, it's time to sympathize! <br /> <br /> When another bites the dust! As if in a "Spagetti Western" this has a lot of similarity with! <br /> <br /> It's not that the Italians can not produce quality productions! There was a series of films for television with a headline like "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts. And they were excellent! But, oh, you will not find it here! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was done around the 60s! Unfortunately, 20 years had passed, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the scathing sharpness of the fast shark that makes a red powder emerge repeatedly in the blue waters. <br /> <br /> In the midst of it all, whether it's a fight at the bar or watching the last bloody demolition of the seaside by the relentlessly hungry shark, the hero's companion looks through his glasses of little concern, as if He was also bored in his relentless role amid the lack of much plot evidence or the development of anyone's character! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly, by his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But, of course, even if the music does not manage to awaken our realization, we have the sinister sound in the voices of the bad guys, as if we wanted to give us a push so that another dark work emerges! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of a turn! Just when we thought everything was totally predictable! But stay tuned, friends, because they can find another turn! If you are looking closely! To, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and have a few beers along the way! It will make your viewing of "The Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to come back to reality when this is over!
