Do not let the name of this movie fool you. Actually, Jake Speed, the character is possibly the most lazy action hero that has been known in the movie. When Jake Speed ​​is not saving the virgin girls from the evil fools, which is often not doing, is seriously relaxing. Maybe this adds to its charm, but in my opinion, an action hero should not "relax" whenever he has the chance. Also, unlike other daring heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless, of course, you call a talent sleeping. Anyway, this movie is basically useless, the writing is deficient and the action, when there is one, is very scarce. (The machine guns in the jeep were not bad, but that's all) So, if you feel like watching a movie that is a cure for insomnia, this piece is perfect for you: it has a hero that not only falls asleep, but also your audience
