Usually, I'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties and the early nineties, the movie that is presented now has been released ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real test of endurance. Boys disguised as girls have been murdered, but never so pathetically. The performance of Corey Haim was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This has no redeeming qualities, even if you are the number one fan of an actor / actress in this piece of junk: get away!
