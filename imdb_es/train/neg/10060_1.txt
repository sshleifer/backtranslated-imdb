The author embarks on a "voyage of discovery" of his "roots" in the tobacco industry of the south because he believes that the film "Bright Leaf" (completely forgotten and deservedly forgotten) is about an ancestor of his. It is not, and in fact does not discover anything of interest even in this glorified homemade film, absolutely silly and self-indulgent, suitable to be projected in the family meetings of the drunks (of the director), but certainly not for a commercial release or even not commercial. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by the main studios, because they are boring, irrelevant and do not interest anyone other than the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
