Rajkumar Santoshi, without a doubt, has directed the best films and the blockbusters of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie does not meet all expectations, since this film is starring two great actors, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, and when you have these two actors in the same movie. You have to make a Magnum Opus. <br /> <br /> In the back of the movie, you can see that Amitabh Bachchan's voice has been dubbed by someone else who owed his illness. <br /> <br /> Still the film did not have an adequate development of the character, besides that the cinematography was not good either and one thing that Bollywood should learn is that they should use the visual effects only when necessary and when Applied should be do with a high budget. The script had so many flaws that it gives the viewer excuses to take their phone calls instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The new merchant shakes his leg well but could not act Well, but where the movie loses big is the script and the cinema of matography history. <br /> <br /> A talented actor like Bhoomika Chawla has been wasted in the film, as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director from time to time in his career makes a bad movie. <br /> <br /> So just look at it if you're a fan of multi-star Flop movies.
