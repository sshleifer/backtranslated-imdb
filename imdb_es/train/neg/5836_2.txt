From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this confusing story of political intrigue and murder. The story, told almost comically, is difficult to swallow. Considered the cast of stars, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel was full of the same drawbacks. It seems that sometimes history is making fun of the most sincere effort presented in "Candidate of Manchuria". A disappointment in all aspects.
