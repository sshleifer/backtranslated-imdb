Now, this movie is not going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons: two big reasons and one smaller, well, there are three reasons, is not it? <br /> <br /> The first reason is this is special effects. I found them quite interesting and somewhat spectacular. Seeing hair grow in Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was chilling, especially when they participated in a ménage à trois. <br /> <br /> Interesting is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown". Sugar "from the song of the Rolling Stones, and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the London cast of the musical rock Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two other notable points in this film , and they were taken out repeatedly during the closing credits.I lost the account, but I swear Sybil Danning showed us those points in closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more.They were the highlight of the movie .
