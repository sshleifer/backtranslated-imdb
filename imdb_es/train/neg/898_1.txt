"Delirious" by Eddie Murphy is totally and totally rude, rude, rude and Luddite. This is, in fact, the only way to describe this disgusting and trashy stand-up. Eddie Murphy chooses the value of the shock instead of laughing to try to win his follow-up. He manages to be funny from time to time, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and sex jokes in bad taste. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you enjoy Eddie's disgusting style. I do not think I bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw." I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
