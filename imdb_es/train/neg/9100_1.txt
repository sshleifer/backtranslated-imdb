Christ, oh Christ ... One looks dazed, incredulous and possibly deranged, while this bad-tempered exercise develops with a joyless smile with all the ingenuity and skill of a paralyzed Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Is there really this film, or was I the involuntary guinea pig of some grim international drug company, taking a sip of my coffee without knowing that it had been enriched with a dangerous hallucinogen? I have seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing prepared me for this; at the end of that, it was a screech, whimpering, ripping the carpet with my teeth like a dog, scratching the walls, howling until my lungs ached. I pleaded desperately, frantically for mercy (to whom this call was made, I do not know), and I longed for the burning desire of Ozu Yasujiro's soothing balm. Sweet weeping Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I am more vulnerable, at least I can handle them. I shudder, I tear up, I bite my nails until my hands are covered in blood, but I can not eliminate the frightening flashbacks from my mind. I'm obsessed I'm damaged I'm the shell of a man. <br /> <br /> Comments from other users here suggest that I am not alone in having suffered this frightening experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exists, or b) I am just a victim among the legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite amazing is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least they have not been left traumatized by it. Maybe they are part of the operation. Damn the maniacs! Damn all of them to hell !!!!!!
