Before this started for the television movie, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the final episode of the series was broadcast and many of the originals in the series were gone. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the second episode of the series, all the regulars, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, left the B-5 permanently. Now, for this movie, they brought Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor make a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because the old chemistry no longer exists, this film already has a great disability. <br /> <br /> The film is about a soul hunter (Martin Sheen) who is taken to Babylon 5 in search of a globe full of souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). Many spooky things happen, but frankly everything was pretty silly and useless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but frankly I felt it was a case of "having done that, and doing it much better in the past". <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, which provided more comic relief, was much more interesting, as a businessman installed a holo-brothel and those in charge were unsure of what to do about it and when they tried to press them to be closed, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was a fluff, but it provided some laughter, something that surely was missing in the other argument. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter - with his wild Eyes and strange delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode he left the character. This should have been detected and corrected. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the final verdict is that this is only for B-5 nuts (like me). Others who see it could assume that the series was crap, which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a program that does not know when to stop smoking.
