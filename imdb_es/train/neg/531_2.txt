With a cast list like this, I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do anything very interesting when their performance is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the film. The summary of the plot says that a secret is revealed to the daughters when their mother approaches death. The thing is that she never says anything to her daughters, except cryptic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that going back and forth between the past and the present was unnecessary. It seemed that the idea had been stolen from the book The Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase the suspense, or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the endless romance of the main characters of the story. Either way, it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way of trying to suspend in a movie that has none. I left wondering why you can not write good movies for women. It really was a disappointment.
