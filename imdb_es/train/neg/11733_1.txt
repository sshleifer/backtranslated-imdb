I'm surprised that there are people who have liked this movie. I saw her in Tribeca and most of the audience laughed at scenes that should not be funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but honestly, the plot of this film needed a MAIN review ... it did not even make sense, a second the characters ask what exactly they are chugging ... the next Scene that they are irremediably addicted and discover how to do it? Also the end just took the cake ... I will not ruin the magnificent conclusion ... but it is quite mixed with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... see this movie to see the comedy if necessary ...
