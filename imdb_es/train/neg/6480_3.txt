It was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. We love Ariel in the first movie, so why does the second one focus on her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like the plot of this. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please, stop redoing classic movies with these bad quality imitations.
