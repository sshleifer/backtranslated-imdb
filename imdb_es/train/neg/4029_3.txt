The idea of ​​the story behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story gets a little boring towards the middle and the excessive use of the archival images, as well as the poor special effects, lead to this film one level lower than the pair. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts with a missile in the direction of Earth. In a state of panic because it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets succeed in diverting the object. However, this is not necessarily good, since this apparently unmanned ship has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each pass you make, there is a death belt, one that could potentially kill us all! Then, it depends on the good scientists from the USA. UU (Led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us, and especially to save New York that is on its route of immediate flight! Unfortunately, they can not save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I can not say whether this is a big loss or not) but thanks to the old knowledge of the United States, they are able to destroy this eventually. Herald of destruction! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​the story is not bad and it's quite original. But, so many old clips of fighter jets and types that handle the range of the radars become a little old and seemed padded. In general, a decent but barely inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like: all the others, see yourself at your own risk.
