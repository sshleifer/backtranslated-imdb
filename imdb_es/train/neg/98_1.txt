I received this movie as a gift, I knew that because of the DVD cover, this movie is going to be bad. After not having seen her for more than a year, I finally saw her. What is a pathetic movie ?. <br /> <br /> I almost did not finish seeing this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without seeing the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when you say "this movie is crap". I'm really surprised that some bad filmmaker Wane has been funded to make this pathetic movie, but it could not have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this film. All you need is a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera. Approximately 15 people without skills to act, a script that was written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this ultra-bad move a reporter (Tara Woodley) leads a drunken man on his way to report on a persecuted city. He is completely unharmed. They went to a house that was supposed to be abandoned, but fortunately for the house it was almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the step of the door was there. only for the supposed drunken man, but not everything is what it seems. <br /> <br /> Then, the supposedly drunk man starts telling ghost / zombie stories to Tara. <br /> <br /> The fist of your stupid The lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Your story <br /> <br /> The sergeant. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die completely exhausted (I think this is what happens) after letting the poor soldier soldier Wilson sit down, let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapsed, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> he buries it in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But the Sergeant. Ben Draper finds himself with a big surprise. his demon wife / girl knows it and she and her lover kill the sergeant. Ben Draper to take revenge on Private Wilson. (Beside the soldier's grave, he was killed) The soldier awakens from his grave in the form of a zombie and kills them to take revenge on him. <br /> <br /> The end of the turn was very little. <br /> <br /> Even if you like HORROR B movies, do not watch this movie
