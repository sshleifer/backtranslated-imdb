I can not understand why so many people praised this show. Twin peaks is one of the most boring titles I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen all the episodes of season 1 and I have seen episode 1 of season 2. I just can not continue with this program. . <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the proper induction in criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In Season 1, there was a scene in which Agent Cooper threw stones at a bottle. Can you guess why he did that? He just wants to identify the killer by making this 'joke' while mentioning the supernatural ability given by the dream of Tibet. Wow! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this program. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a "funny" scene that serves an old fool Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor. (He already has gun shots in his belly). This old man does not do more than say some stupid comments. That is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec ... It's like hell). <br /> <br /> I would read some comics instead of watching them. this show more.
