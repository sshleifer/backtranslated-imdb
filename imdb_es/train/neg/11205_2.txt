Yeah, well, I definitely regretted giving up on my Saturday night watching this strange, but very long, movie. Apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life. Here is the epitome of the antihero in 'Do not repent'. We have this imbecile, so messy, so vagabond, so selfish, aimless and unpleasant that it was extremely difficult to overcome the attraction of Jaemin, the promised son of a very favored businessman, unless it was just that: physical attraction. Affirms the opposite, which is love. But after seeing this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you dig your beard. (Okay, it's not that bad, but it still does not have really redeemable features.) I could never overcome the reason why Jaemin stalks Sumin. It was never shown, it was just said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture thing that went over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It has to be that way, because a little more than half of the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is harassing from one place to another to the point where I thought this was turning into a crazy comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "baby" to appear. Agreed, Sumin provides two jobs while going to school, so far, well with someone trying to improve themselves. But after trying for the first time the attraction of his stalker, he leaves his daily job for some kind of prostitution network. What? Okay, well, as mentioned above, the obsession does not stop due to the change of job / career and if you get into a lot of other very angry characters, you get a messy movie in which it seems that incredible things happen without accumulation. Basic movie, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
