Who I am No, I'm not kidding. That's what it really says in the case of the video. <br /> <br /> Plot; Short version: Pretty woman who is around smiling. This, for some reason, causes all men to kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... I can not find Ariel ..." She's right behind you, idiot ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this small and frightening Space Opera has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> A group of cheesy actors who are mostly convicts come after the first one. The selection of actors is eliminated very quickly. Then they fall in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had more time on screen and larger paychecks. The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / fault seems physically impotent and does nothing. Why can not he stay on the computer instead of doing his "teleport to a vampire" routine? (Actually, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire, or to have done more than just stare at people, which is all she does, this is enough for all men to kill each other. .) <br /> <br /> This is not really a space movie. There are many more shots of the old west trail, of the Easy Rider trail of 1950, of the Film noir nightclub scene, even of a trot on the beach in fantasy land, none of which has real depth or meaning. The nightclub scene is black and white, of course. He worked with "The Wizard of Oz". It does not work so well, here. This is probably a good thing, since those few shots that show space are depressingly foolish. You will probably cry at those times, especially when you see that "spaceship" that rotates about three inches long. <br /> <br /> You do not feel anything for any of the characters, not because they are convicted or have nothing. personality, but because they have a great need for acting lessons, except Billy Dee Williams, who really looks depressed and lost, probably for being in this job ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those Films that, when seen with friends, will cause some extremely "loud" silences, especially when the nerd throws his comics attempt on a line (including the line about kissing a meteorite in French ... Did I hear that?) Maybe? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls are "killed", which means nothing, since, to begin with, they are not even real. Well, the other "characters" are not either, but that is not relevant. LOL. <br /> <br /> What is more funny is that the scene that adorns the video case is a kind of horror skull, something strange (green filter added on top of that, to give it more of). ..uh ... green look), which is actually the android after it is killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else going on. <br /> <br /> Another strange deal that I noticed. Whenever there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes highly pixelated. I do not mean a pixelated LITTLE, I mean HUGE blocks about 1/16 the size of the screen. Wow.
