It seems that a lot of people liked the movie, so I feel bad for giving it a bad review. But after spending 96 minutes, I feel like I have to. Where the hell is the plot in this movie? I must have lost it, I was waiting for the story to unfold and nothing happened. Of course the ending was "somewhat shocking" but they did not. I forgot who was who half the time, so they did not really develop the characters. The performance was regular, most of the time it was credible, but I was able to see it most of the time. So ... without revealing anything, I must say that unless you like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I did not understand why there was so little or too little of the film. I can not decide what it would be, that is why I say judge for yourselves. I do not even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 General: 3/10 I feel like that's too much High really, I'll take my vote up at the top.
