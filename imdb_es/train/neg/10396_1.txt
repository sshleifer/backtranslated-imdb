Being a filmmaker, and with a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was going to love it when I took home "My Wrongs ..." (not that the cover of the DVD yields anything, instead of opting for what ambiguous quote from the controversial director, Chris Morris, "a short film that includes scenes"). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is repulsive (especially since we are very familiar with Morris' distorted attitude towards Pedophilia from his notorious television series, Brass Eye, and it serves no purpose other than to scandalize. this film will be described as a comedy that I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The runner's comment sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it is often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the process However, unfortunately, this is not the case here, instead, they invite us to a public schoolboy who talks about the dogs in the film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is very interesting, but it's not worth a single frame of celluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie is not going anywhere would be an understatement, it relies too much on its improved style, at the expense of the plot, the character and the dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and dissatisfied. His simplified message, that man must take responsibility for his actions, is both evident and poorly enlightened. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince. To entertain, to illuminate and end up being irritating. If you want to see a great short film work, I recommend "It's a wonderful life" by Franz Kafka, by Peter Capaldi.
