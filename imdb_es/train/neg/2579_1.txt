I must say that I used to be a big fan of the series. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've seen. It's a shame, because this was a great series and it's getting worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but a little effort would be good. <br /> <br /> No laughter, just a couple of good one-line phrases that will bring a smile if that. There's a lot of nudity and very hot girls. But neither sensual things nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> To add to all this, this is also a RACIST movie or a racist movie that you can do without asking to be called racist. I am NOT one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But the portrait of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I would not waste time with this garbage. See the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.
