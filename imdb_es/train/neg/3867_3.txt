Oh, such a familiar comedy story about the discreet sympathetic Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met the night before. After lying about that to his girlfriend Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed a story like this one at least once before ... in the movie or on television. The film is a formula and it is EXTREMELY predictable, with an ending that you can see a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast provides some interest and keeps it visible. Lee is right in the lead, and Stiles is very funny in a cheerful comedic role, different from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But, you know, this is not exactly well written. At least one question remains unanswered: for WHAT, exactly, Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, is being investigated by the AI? <br /> <br /> And I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; He's a super nasty asshole that made me so nervous that I was begging someone to hit him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: a free, uncredited cameo from the comic / actor Larry Miller, once again playing a grouch (in this case, he's a little justified, his character is an ultraconservative minister). <br /> <br /> It's not good at all, but as usual in my case, I give it three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
