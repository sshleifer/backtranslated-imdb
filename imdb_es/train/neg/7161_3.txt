A young American woman visits her Irish roots and defends herself from a druid witch who wants to possess her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where I was going. The film seems to be in two directions: are we seeing the tribulations of the Irish-American woman fighting her alcohol problem or are we watching a horror movie about an evil witch returning from the past? The director seems unable to decide. The two do not seem to gel and in the end you do not get anywhere. This could be done much better and the story seemed to crawl towards the end. This was very boring and disappointing.
