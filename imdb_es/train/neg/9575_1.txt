First, let's start by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for having to associate with this piece of nonsense. I had to give this a 1 that would not let me give it a zero. Do you want to know how bad this movie is? my mother calls me from the other side of the city and says "son, I just saw the stupidest movie in history." I replied saying "the murderous language, huh? "She was like, how did you know?" This is how bad this movie is, I mean, It seemed like a good movie at the beginning, Freddy Pinhead Melinda, okay, I'll give it a try, I sat for the rest of the movie just because I wrote a column for horror movie reviews, please do not waste your time money or even brain cells in this ridiculous piece of shit run away, if you see it on the Hollywood shelf in a blockbuster or even in your local video store , turn it around and go away ... and I still want my two hours ago
