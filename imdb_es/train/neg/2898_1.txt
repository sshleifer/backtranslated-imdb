Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, I finally finished watching this terrible movie !! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes, but I thought I would give it a try because I just had to improve. Or at least it has some redeeming qualities, like at least I thought it would be a movie that makes you think, or like a really smart movie, very well filmed or something ... It goes without saying that it was not like that, and wasted around an hour and a half of my life. I'm not even going to go into why it's terrible because it's a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down with the issue of spoilers and pay more attention to make sure that people who qualify Movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or participate in any way in the movie or anything like that. I thought it would be funny after this terrible movie to come see how bad the grade would be and I was very surprised to see the ratings quite high ... all grades with around 7-10 stars should clearly be almost COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movie ... Still I'm a huge IMDb fan, but I seriously reconsidered this rating process because this movie should not be better than Maaaybbbeee as a 3.
