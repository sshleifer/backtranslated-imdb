This may seem crazy even to people who remember this program ... But I remembered this as a live action. I do not think I've ever seen the caricature. but the movie maybe. I remember it very clearly. The boy was in a building a bit like a showroom. I even had the red jacket. It was dark and it became a red car and there was a guy on the second level who was watching him. The car / man turned and crashed into the large display window and went out into the street. And then proceeded to depart. That is all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers it too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope it is not.
