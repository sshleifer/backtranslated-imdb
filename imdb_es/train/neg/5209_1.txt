Ok, I got bored and I saw it all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is soft, harmless and without shine. The story is so sugary that it rots the teeth in the initial titles. A line of two "traumatized" children who learn about "God", the story of fairies that, frankly, left me quite traumatized. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotyped way that one expects no true Irishman to see it. Aimed at children who, frankly, would turn off after the first attempt to accent "OIRISH". In general, why do they pump these?
