This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. It can be said that they are really trying to polish a turd, but we all know that you can not. The writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see them try to sell it. Humor and rhythm are so laborious that it is hard to believe that any of these good actors have signed up for this. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so terrible that it's hard for us to look away from the screen. We just have to know where this train's nest is going. But that's just because we caught him on TV. If we had really PAID for this, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> Then you get 2 stars for being at least fun / fascinatingly bad. And the incidental music (unlike the indie soundtrack that tries too hard) is ridiculously reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
