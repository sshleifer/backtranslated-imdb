This movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were composed by the most brazen lunatics who have worked in a television movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately represents Senator McCarthy. It's a horrible scam and I'm surprised that someone associated with this production has gotten another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this trash did it to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and his fear that someone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these crazy communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took over where McCarthy left him and they could not stop him, making the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never, never see this movie if you're looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason" to better see the truth about Senator McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help if you read what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
