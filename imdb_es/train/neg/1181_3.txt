This film was involved in a scandal for so long that it became a sought-after element ... outrage, mystery, etc. It had everything to be a great cinematographic piece, but finally it fails in all aspects. It's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, an erotic and malicious film. <br /> <br /> The 2 disc DVD includes a magnificent brochure with photos, interviews, bestiality essays, etc., as well as an extensive interview with the director more than pretentious. For those who have listened but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until one really sees the movie. Disc 1 contains the edited film, poorly translated into English but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains the director's cut, in a terrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the real beast? A puppet of Kermit, the frog, would have been more effective and shocking.
