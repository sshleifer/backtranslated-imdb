I love the books of Henry James and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie that is coming out, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is a mistake and does not play the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her foolish and insipid role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the cinema watching this long, prolonged and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a pointer playback. In the book I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also disliked the turn where his aunt has a sexual attraction with Morris. Eeeeeeeek YUK <br /> <br /> Look at it if you can not sleep, it's a definite snoozer. Do not look at it if you are depressed. You will need Zoloft after this. <br /> <br /> Sure, "The Heiress" was outstanding with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played his father was on the list as the carefree and cold father ... still crying for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The film was not faithful to the book, but neither is it. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office failure. I have no doubt why.
