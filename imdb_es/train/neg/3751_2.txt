I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This movie, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Apart from background music? What really marks the mood of the movie? It lacks almost all the qualities that I have come to associate with Lynch's work. The images are boring, to say the least, and the dialogue is too vague and monotonous to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> This feels more like a movie than the students try to make a film of artistic dogma that work. from an experienced director. I have seen many amateur films with camera work, landscapes, sound and much higher screenplays. This film lacks almost all the artistic qualities. I feel like I'm watching one of Davids homemade videos, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
