I bought this movie in the trash can from the Rogers video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie from time to time and I realized that it looked like a good one. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty clich√©d "1970" and it's pretty cool for that. Unfortunately, the story line is hard to follow and not much happens in the movie. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and, a week later, I thought I should see everything, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has good spots, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you like movies B, this could be for you, you just have to keep in mind that the movie is slow and not too much really happens, and did not I mention a lot of history ... <br / > <br />
