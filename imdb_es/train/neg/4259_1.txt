I did not know anything about this movie before I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was an "endless epic battle scene from beginning to end". That could not have been further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, badly written films, directed by amateurs and horribly acted that I had the misfortune to put my eyes on them. I would classify it there with the movie that I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There's basically no story, it's hard to believe that the creators of this movie thought that this corny soap opera shit would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It also presents some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells the girl "you smell like a moon". The girl responds "What does the moon smell like?" OMG! You got to be kidding! The scene in which the boy was drawn and dismembered provoked some good laughs from the audience, since it seemed ridiculously cheap and the FX sound of the boy who was being smashed reminded me of someone making a fart sound with his mouth. If this is playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision in about 45 minutes, so I needed to recover my dream ... and so I did. Horrible.
