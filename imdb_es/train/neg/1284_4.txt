This movie was a long build without climax. The people to whom in the end they refer to the fight of swords as big must be crazy or not have any. Very often this movie softened. I'm not saying soft films are bad. But no matter how fond you are of sugar, you should not have room in a bone steak. This movie was supposed to be about revenge for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a bar fight. And only one of them really knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" without knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. As a drama, this movie had its periods, but the best performance has to go to the nature of Scotland. This is a little more than what is called "soap" in my book.
