I was curious to see this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of views or opinions. It does not matter to me, if Jesus existed in the way it is written in the Bible. Whether Mary was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What made me angry is when someone takes a prayer, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, in this film they showed a great phrase: "Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king, bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they did not do I tell you it's the context . Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is not a passage in the bible where Jesus supports murder. He is love! After citing the wrong bible, they present us screaming at people (pseudo-Christians) full of hate. Most viewers do not check the information presented, so they begin to think that Jesus = hate = not good for me or for anyone else. This is pure manipulation people. Please use your brain Do not take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own base, our civilization if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message that he brought us. You saw the branch you're sitting on
