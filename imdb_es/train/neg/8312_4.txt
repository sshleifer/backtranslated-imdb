The idea of ​​the thumb is not so winning the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for several reasons. Mainly, I think Mr. Oedekerk had a lot less to work with in shipping the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has not been converted (yet?) Into a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to make that resonate in the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are full of unique Jokes that do not really seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the "jump from the end of the ship" scene is not funny. Rather, you only think to yourself: "Did I miss something in the original movie?" There were too many jokes without a base (see arachnid). <br /> <br /> In contrast, the shipping of Smarmy's boat designer had a meaning and was fun. It was also very funny to send the guy in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around the world, demanding "everything" to be "faster", including the sinking of the ship and that he himself was the first in dying This kind of teasing meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave Thumbtanic a significant mood. <br /> <br /> The "average" thumb, the faces and the voices, are still fun. The accessories and games and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. In general, although ThumbTanic proves that extravagance by itself does not work, this movie still keeps you entertained and laughing to the end.
