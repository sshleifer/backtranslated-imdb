After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to meet and make a similar style anthology film based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes appear and disappear too quickly; for when you think you are getting into a story, in many cases it ends. And, often, they start and stop and then start again, with the stories interwoven. As a result, there is no title that indicates that a story is complete and less formal in its structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, however, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was successful or not (mostly hit), most of "New York, I Love You" was Miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual by nature but also much less sweet, and often quite terrible. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting movie, with only a few exceptional stories, and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more. Now I understand, it was good quality music, but its somber tone really made me feel like I was cutting my wrists. Among the best was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to the prom, the couple talked about cheating outside a restaurant (although this was also in the first movie) and the elderly couple. All this is very sad because I had loved the first movie so much, and I REALLY WANTED to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I just did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was surprised at how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent movie, that was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One is that Kevin Bacon (wearing a fresh-brimmed hat) eats a hot dog ... and absolutely NOTHING else for almost ten minutes. The other shows a teenager who passes the film by videotaping the world, including a very unhappy couple.
