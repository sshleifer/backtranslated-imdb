This movie only gets a second star because I work in the center and I liked seeing it destroyed. The effects were pretty good, I heard it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. Being the most expensive and still absolutely horrible makes it a huge waste of money. I rented it to not complain too much about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours that I will never go back. The holes of the plot abound. terrible acting on the whole board. I do not recommend wasting time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to see this, run away. I can not emphasize how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell did the second dragon come from? Why did not he appear before? How did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs only 500 years ago?
