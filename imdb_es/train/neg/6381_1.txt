This film is about a group of extraterrestrial gay black men who exterminate women on Earth to create a gay Universe. <br /> <br /> I saw it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. However, I was surprised at how bad it was. It seemed more like a movie made 50 years ago. The performance, in your case, is ultra bad. The sets and accessories are ridiculously false, which makes any university film look like a mega-budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, in fact, the mouth open as others have commented, but the mouth is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> You have to be very intoxicated or in a state of altered consciousness to be able to appreciate this movie. If I were from Denmark, I would feel very embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen would produce such a horribly bad movie.
