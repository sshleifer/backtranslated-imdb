Pranks, one of the crowd of slashers that appeared in the early eighties, is notable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies quite soon, and the rest of the movie is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas holidays, a group of students volunteers to clean the condemned university building of their furniture. A crazy killer, however, throws a key into the job by methodically hitting the young ones one by one in a variety of gruesome ways. <br /> <br /> Exploiting all the clich√©s of stalking and cutting in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow offers a boring and tedious horror that made me pray for the characters to be killed, so I can continue to see something worthwhile . Most deaths (which, let's face it, is the reason why we usually see this type of movie) are brief and not so bloody; The only truly spooky image comes right at the end, when the remaining survivors discover the bodies of the victims (there is a corpse dismembered with blood that the film could have done with more information). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film is saved from the misfortune of receiving the lowest score possible on my part by having an unexpected good ending, but this is only one for the slasher finalists.
