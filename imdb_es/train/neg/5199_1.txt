['In the first 20 minutes, all the possible clichés were eliminated by the hacker writer and director. There was the primary investigator of the NTSB with tortured family life; Ted McGinley, board member of the NTSB and politically tortured, played by [I can kill ANY TELEVISION]; the tortured father of a shock victim; and the torturer attorney chasing the ambulance. <br /><br /> Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of airplanes. The plane that crashed was a 737 and was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippopotamus who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most people should have walked away in the light of how many people survived the plane that was destroyed in Iowa after it lost its hydraulic system. Most of this television plane was not even burned. <br /><br /> It reminded me of the scene in &quot;Air Force One&quot; where the 747 touches the water and then jumps as if it were made of one-inch-thick steel. <br /><br /> The show was so bad that it was impossible to see it. Even my wife, who accepts more than me, commented on technical failures. What surprised me was how this POS could be done. Are the producers of these things so accustomed to clichés that they can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars doing this real. I wish it was the boy&#39;s next date. I have the title of a wonderful bridge in New York that would sell cheaply.']
