Soho recreation of 1950 (London) and promising people. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who really can not act is one thing, but two hours? What was I thinking? In addition to who are the spectators? Who cares about a book that was well remembered a long time ago? The usual London story of the chancer taking his chance. <br /> <br /> What could drag this movie even further down? Oh, I know, third-class songs that sound as if they were invented in the place. David Bowie criticizes the title of the film again and again and that is the highlight. The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> There is something good, however. Good recreation of the Soho period. Too bad they could not think of anything to put forward.
