A student filmmaker recruits a B-grade actress (a magnificently diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror movie that her mother (a terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tried to do 12 years ago. It is a curious plot option, to say the least, since any Australian horror aficionado knows that the genre lacks female directors. The movie has a curse, because Molly had to kill a psycho killer on the original set. But she is back, because she needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the "set". Cutting is an Australian attempt at the modern "slasher", but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it tears half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. A lot of names from the world of cinema that fall to the "Scream" (except it's the name of an Australian - Jane Campion ... look how this is not so fun) and a lot of "is this real or is it a movie"? the "new nightmare". The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl from the film team tells the owner of the house where she is filming: "Do not worry, we will treat your house as if it were ours, "To which he replies," that does not mean anything to me, it seems you live in a garbage dump! Saying ah! And Molly's ridiculous phrases were enough not to regret the rent of this one. "Do you have coke here? "(while traveling in the movie teacher's car) and" Does anyone know where I can buy tofu? "(the first thing he mutters on the set) and" Where the hell is my agent? "(oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her).
