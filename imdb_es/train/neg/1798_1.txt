How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and continue to stink? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This sucks and he likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies that I have to warn people about. It's a vile atrocity that induces vomiting and is asking you to see it so you can feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redemption factors. <br /> <br /> For a movie about heavy metal, it sure does not seem to capture what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film makes heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. That is quite a feat, however negative it may be. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad that you will be angry with yourself for having seen it. We hope that this simple equation will keep you away from this movie without brains or gut.
