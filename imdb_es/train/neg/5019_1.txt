This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If the camera's super-fast takes are faster than this, it's better to pay twenty dollars to get into the laundry, buy popcorn and see how the dryer turns. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope that he does not make deals in the future to make another film based on clich√©s like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie you should avoid, this is "The One".
