He was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the late works of what he considered to be great filmmakers, and that ordinary viewers are generally considered artistic failures (such as Renoir's or Chaplin's latest films, yes, the "politique des auteurs" as well). it has its dark side). But with "Les amours d 'Astrée et de Céladon", it is as if Rohmer himself wanted, for what could be his last film, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile film, adapting "L'astrée" of Urfé. "With ridiculous aesthetic codes, which seem like a parody of Rosselini's latest films (those he did for Descartes' television or Marx's lives). <br /> <br /> In his version of" Perceval, "Rohmer He refused to film real landscapes to give a re-transcription of what could have been a classic representation of things in middle age.The director apparently changed his mind when it comes to the seventeenth century, and films the actors, dressed as peasants 1600, reciting its ancient text surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes, but everything seems even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees, not that history itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems to be so childish and amateur that it quickly becomes fun (and I'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the humorous and sad humorist) by Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous the soft-erotic tone, the bad musical attempts, or the strange fascination with transversion.). <br /> <br /> The radical aesthetics of the film ultimately make it look like a joke, mixing a soft erotic film made for television with scholastic theological discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of history is now disfigured by modernity, and that is why he had to shoot "L'Astrée" in other parts of the country. However, I am sure that the film would look more modern and interesting, if Rohmer had filmed the same story in a modern area with the same narrative codes and artistic decisions. This film may interest some historians, but most moviegoers can laugh at this latest and sad Rohmer movie.
