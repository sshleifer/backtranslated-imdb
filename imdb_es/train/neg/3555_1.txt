Years ago, a movie that went as a friend and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it was starring John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), Oscar-nominated three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to support himself float . Until we saw The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes's income was obtained from any film that was offered to him. If we had known what the film was about before we saw it, we could have avoided it altogether. But we did not leave. At that time, my friend and I joked that it was the worst movie that had ever been made. Now frankly, this is not true. I've seen a lot of bad movies on Friday nights at Cinemax (did I just say that out loud?) That they are much worse than The Incubus. Almost any film starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a movie worse than The Incubus. Certainly, Santa Claus conquers the Martians is a movie worse than The Incubus. However, since then I have used The Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When I talk to this friend about a movie I may have seen, I will always say it was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
