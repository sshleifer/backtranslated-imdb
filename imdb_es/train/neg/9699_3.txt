Despite what many other people thought about the first movie, I really liked it. This however. How to summarize it in one word ?: This movie is (and here comes the word): SHIT! <br /> <br /> But let's see one part for another: Here's the plot: Finally, the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has other problems: the Court Jester, the father of his son, has gone astray, as the super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, to fight against his gray hair and sells The royal offspring for some blond and full hair. In desperation, Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find his six other dwarf companions and then try to find the real offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend, where writers were very drunk but were under the pressure of the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it really is not worth buying the DVD. Believe me <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least somehow saves the film from total oblivion are the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the 3/10 play. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can compensate for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point, they even cross into our reality, and sadly ... they do not do anything funny being here. <br /> <br /> However, there are many great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but , unfortunately, all these comedians are not able to give life to this really bad script. <br /> <br /> It may be a treat for some hardcore fans, but for movie buffs or for tenants or DVD buyers, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I even regret having rented the movie.
