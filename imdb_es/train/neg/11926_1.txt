I'm rarely moved to make these kind of comments, BUT after spending most of Rankin's terrible movie, I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I feel about it. I really could not get to the end, and I became one of the half dozen or more outlets (about 1/3 of the audience) after the irregular plot, the unfortunate dialogue and the insulting characterization became too difficult to bear. This movie is all pose and not art. All style and no substance. It is overloaded by a terrible performance, a genuinely serious script, an indifferent cinematography and production values ​​at the student level. How it was financed, started and ended is a mystery to me. I bet you a million pounds to never go on general sale. Appropriate critics would tear it apart. A very bad movie. surprisingly bad really a very poor effort And that's without even mentioning the free moment of a newborn kitten falling into a fryer. totally meaningless, completely light, poorly assembled; This movie is a terrible shame for British cinema.
