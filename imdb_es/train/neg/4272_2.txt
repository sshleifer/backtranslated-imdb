This type of movies where a psychopath of one or another variety tries to damage the reputation (and, finally, completely eliminate) a naive person to take over his life. Fatal attraction, Pacific Heights, The hand that rocks the crib, A single white woman and a thousand movies made for television are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid characters, suspense or some twists of the plot, illegal entry plays everything for the book. And if it were not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film would sink into mediocrity faster than a miniseries by Danielle Steele. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr in an incessant way Naive guy who asks the help of a couple of officers when someone bursts into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he calmly dismisses his anger at feeling so helpless in the situation with the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits to his power. At first, empathizing with Carr (probably just pretending to do so), the policeman befriends the couple. But soon, the police want to put everyone aside, destroying the lives of the boys almost the way they can (which is quite easy when you are a policeman, and when you are the policeman who installed the security system of that type in his house) to take charge and presumably, get his wife. It seems less goal-oriented, and more like the policeman just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an ending. And the story unfolds entirely in the book, you can probably predict each occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the moment "shocking", our main character and naive realizes that he is the victim of a fraud with credit cards (perpetrated by the villain psychopath) until the end of "is not really dead."
