Great Western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure what movie you saw, but it must have been different from the one I saw. Great western movies or good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this movie did not have any! The acting was bad to say the least and I could not care less about any of the characters, making the whole movie useless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe they should try to directly do the low budget garbage of the television as seen in the programs "FACT OR FICTION" in science fiction. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, a great western or even a pleasant hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
