This movie was a yawn of titles to credits, it is boring to the point of tedium and the performance is wooden and forced. I must admit that this was the directorial debut of director Richard Jobson, but who on Earth gave the green light to a script as little developed as this one? It seems that another money from the government's drainage project (Scottish Screen is credited with surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and, unfortunately, my review will have to be more moderate than this. Please, Mr. Jobson, what have you been doing before directing this film sedative? Return to him!
