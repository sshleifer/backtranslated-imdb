I suppose any novel that is as disappointing as Moby Dick would find no favor among Depression-era audiences who had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic novel by Herman Melville is purely coincidental. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not that it has been preserved too much for the film. First we meet Ahab Creely (he has last name and brother) as a happy and fortunate soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, who is the daughter of Father Mapple. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in outstanding performance. Barrymore had not mastered the talkies and surrendered to all the histrionics of the silent era plus a theatrical voice that would have shaken the beams of any movie theater in which he was playing this movie. His leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say that the scene of the amputation was quite frightening. Of course, this was all before the Code. I'm still sure that the 1930 public shuddered. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of Ahab hunting for the whale that he believes made him unpleasant in the eyes of Joan Bennett. That's not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact, there are no female characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that Melville did was to invite the crew of Ahab's ship, the Pequod, with personalities. Apart from Queequeg, the cannibal harpooner the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly out of curiosity and nothing more.
