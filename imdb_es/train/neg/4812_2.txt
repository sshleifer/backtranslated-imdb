I thought any horror movie with Orson Welles would be weird. Necromancy was, but it was a bit too weird for its own sake. In fact, the film has a spooky feeling, since it is about a group of Satanists / witches in a small town and the attempt of a young woman to escape them. However, the director seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience using flashbacks and dream sequences. By the end, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, since the story is so confusing, it's hard enough to encourage any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles agrees to head this film, especially because he does not have much to do. Maybe one day they will put a tape of the shots and errors of this movie. That would be really fun!
