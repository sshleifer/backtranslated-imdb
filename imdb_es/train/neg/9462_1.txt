Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is another big misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents do not be fooled, taking a child from elementary school to this movie is a big mistake. There were many times when I felt uncomfortable not only because the humor was inappropriate for the children, but also because it was totally unexpected and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, The cat in the hat It's still a terrible movie. The casting and the general appearance of the film are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always friendly (or odious in this case) Alec Baldwin are good in their roles, but Preston is too beautiful for a role like this. Children are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that kept me watching and not throwing things to the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was a talking cat too big in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I did not like it as Shrek's voice, and I really think that Myers should not be allowed to be near the realm of children's films now. His interpretation of The Cat is a slightly softened version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, if only for a day, ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and conflict. <br /> <br /> The Cat in the Hat may be the worst movie for children of all time.
