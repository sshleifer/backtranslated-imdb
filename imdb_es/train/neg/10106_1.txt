Yes, I'm sure it really could be a nation. . . if four of them stopped in the four corners of the world and the other two were cloned a few thousand million times. Man, I'm very happy to have seen this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a huge fan of George Romero's movies and I'm pretty sure if I watched this movie, I'd probably throw up while laughing too much. I mean, what about the raccoon girls pretending to be zombies and walking like Charlie's Demons? It also helped a lot that the music composer chose the fashion show music for when the zombies approached their killer, especially the part where they enter the store, posing as the furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / any room. with the gong in the background, and the living woman was arguing about the closed furniture store. He could not even tell what the murderer's nationality was, and the fact that his accent indicated that several nations did not help either. Oh, well, what can I expect from a movie in which they throw a random fight scene for no reason in a warehouse where they apparently send air boxes around the world? So, for all those who love Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like bad C movies (C for Craptastic), this is the movie for you. . . or not.
