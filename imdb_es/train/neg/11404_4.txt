It's a bit fascinating to me that so many critics consider this a masterpiece. I am not a dullard in terms of quality films, and I agree that, from the technical point of view of the film, as well as for several of the characters portrayed, the film is in a class worthy of a prize. But there is no sense (for me) that this movie is going anywhere; I mean, take the viewer anywhere. It's a series of humorous scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more than one movie. I'm looking for history and movement and an arrival fulfillment, none of which I found in this movie. Yes, it could be considered poetry in the cinema. . . but there is a lot of poetry that I can not live with for the same reason: that he paints pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One more thing to say is that it documents an English mid-century childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. Personally, I was appalled at what a young British man had to experience at that time and place. Having grown up in the United States just a decade before, I can say with authority that the contrast is immense. I can not help but wonder if this contrast has had any effect on those who review the film so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film completely in its "film magic" (which I acknowledge is there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of the remembered experience?
