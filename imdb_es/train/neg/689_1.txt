What the hell is this? This must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera. I know you can not set your expectations for an 80s slasher, but this is too stupid to be true. I went through this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel the need to claim my money. Can you imagine who it costs THIS? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are their motivations? Well, actually, I could not care less. And why should you? The manufacturers of this piece of junk insurance did not care. They did not try to create a bit of tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter, I think it's much easier to find money with a name like that) also made the Kindred (1986) quite enjoyable and recently did Soul Survivors. Complete the garbage too, but at least that had Eliza Dushku. This scrap has the debut of Daphne Zuniga! (Who?) Yes, it's true, the girl from Melrose Place. His memorable character dies at 15 min. After the opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention it or miss it later, who cares? The rest of the actors ... do not deserve the term actors in reality, they are completely uninteresting. You expect them to die quickly and painfully ... and not just their characters. <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
