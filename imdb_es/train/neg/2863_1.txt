I was glad to see this movie for free since I am working in the hotel industry and this movie recently came to our movie library. Nothing against low-budget movies, but this movie has a horrible acting and direction. How can you make a movie like this? The director must be on the blacklist, and for all poor actors, it's certainly not a springboard for a career. Please make sure that you will not see this movie, the performance is poor, the camera and the direction are horrible. There are some more movies out there that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should donate it to charity, so at least it serves for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case I would see it even another 10 (or at least one more time).
