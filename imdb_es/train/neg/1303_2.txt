Tattooed Stranger, by Edward Montagne, is supposed to play as a crime thriller with a bit of black cinema mixed in for flavor. Instead, it is an ill-acted and witty look at the low budget and the creation of uninspired films. The plot is absurd and the acting is unbearably rigid and amateur. John Miles, who had a pretty thin resume in the industry, smiles and laughs, and everyone else acts with the same enthusiasm as the characters in a film strip made by the government about driver safety. The film anticipates programs like 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' in his unnatural vision of New York in 1950. Wow, the viewer does not even see anyone light a cigarette until they interview a well-formed woman. in a houseboat in the middle of the movie. The only thing that the film has in its favor (besides its brevity) are the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The film's low budget works in favor of the director of photography, since the viewer can enjoy well-framed shots of the interiors of New York City and its extensive exteriors. Unless you want to enjoy the movie for the camera angle settings, I suggest you watch virtually any other movie.
