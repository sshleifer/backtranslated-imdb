Another British romantic comedy for which audiences around the world seem to have a voracious appetite. This feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre: all the classic clich√©s are here, from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after the trains that come out to declare love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, except Love-Hewitt, which manages to bring some cohesion to the film. Things threaten to get out of control in the plausibility department as the movie progresses; our kindly suspension of belief finally collapses during the absurd end. If you are looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill type experience, you will not find it here.
