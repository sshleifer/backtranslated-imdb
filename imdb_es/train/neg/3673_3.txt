William Hurt diving scientist ??? Do US agents direct the investigation abroad? Did the contaminated sick man kick his butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? The sniper is missing and he does not kill Hurt (only injuring him) but is the second shot of "death" dead? Waste of time. To compare this with falling as other critics did is ridiculous. Oh, and at the end of the movie, they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands, except for the "evil" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "virus handshake". What? By the way ... When did IMDb require 10 lines of text? I'm babbling here. Is not this simply a description of the content of the reviews if it is required to have x number of lines?
