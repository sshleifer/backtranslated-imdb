A repressed housewife (an annoyed Angie Dickinson, whose body treats us and horrifies us with a close-up of her delights) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch out. This translates directly into a series of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, I'm clearly in the wrong business if SHE can take home $ 600 per night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to see how it is stolen from De Palma (sorry, "pay homage to") Hitchcock, look at "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", although loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the most brazen thrillers I've had the distaste of sitting. The plot is absurd and tired. It has some surprisingly effective jump scares and unpleasant graphic assassination sequences that should please any fanatic of horror, as long as they can overcome the stupid story, which must have been dated even in 1980.
