If you are going to see this movie, you will have a grudge against the movie theater, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to go see it. What a shame, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more frightening if the Japanese actors had spoken in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on television and in the movie trailers that promoted this money maker. Sarah Michelle really did not have to act to make this movie ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.
