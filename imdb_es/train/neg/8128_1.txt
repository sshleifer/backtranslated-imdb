Okay, do not let my summary fool you. This movie sucks hard. But the worst movie of all? This movie was terrible in ways that people should not have to break the brain to describe. But it is by no means worse than Hands: the hands of fate, the hobgobblins, the horrors of the island of spiders or a handful of movies. As a critic, the movie sucks, it's terrible. Do not see it without MST or you may develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
