This movie is really vile. Play in the urban paranoia of the 70/80 and put it in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not unproblematic areas, but this vile piece of exploitation takes away the cookie. The violence is beyond anything realistic imaginable, but in this case it is not a case of social problems, but a white student of upper-middle class uses it to become the crime boss of his great local Scotsman. And, of course, he knows how to play the system. Does it sound familiar to you? Yes. This turd is purely violent exploitation, a really unpleasant job. Brutality disguised as social commentary is disturbing. This belongs to the same category as trash as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on. The only notable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time he had to do things like this.
