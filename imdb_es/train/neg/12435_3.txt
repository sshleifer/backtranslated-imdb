Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film of the Empire Home Alone. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip with a missile guidance system and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote-controlled toy car. Due to baggage confusion, the ill-tempered Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) takes the car. He gives it to his neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies appear. The spies rent a house to steal each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. Alex, who is alone at home with chicken pox, calls 911 every time he discovers a robbery in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making jokes. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, not realizing that he has manipulated devices to intelligently trap his entire home. Home alone 3 was not horrible, but it probably should not have been done, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Only at home 3 had some fun parts, but I do not like it when the characters change into a series of movies, watch at your own risk.
