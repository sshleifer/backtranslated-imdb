What a horrible movie. I love the monster movies, but I could not see half of the terrible performances, the cardboard characters and the abysmal special effects. There is nothing that redeems about this movie. The characters come from an endless supply of suicide cannon fodder or else they are empty and uninspiring sock puppets. The plot is formulated, cut and pasted, science standard directed by amok drivel. Even the CGI is horrible. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the movie to give you good eyes. There are no surprises here, just the same as always. This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman must hang on a lamp post so that children can use it as a pi√±ata.
