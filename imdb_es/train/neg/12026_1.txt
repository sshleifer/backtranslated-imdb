I really want that when making a comedy, people really try to make it fun. This is a movie you can sit on, but nothing special. After seeing it, you will say it was fine. It was not boring to look, but he did not tease the audience to laugh. Entertainment should mean that you really get something more than an o.k. history. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 out of 10.
