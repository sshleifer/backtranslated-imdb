Is incredible!! .. yes, someone before me wrote that it was a waste of time to sit down and watch this movie ... it is! Do not do that I'm totally irritated! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I thought it was funny that he interpreted the meaning of his name in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (at home alone, of course) but now (right after) I am absolutely disappointed. It was his worst movie. Inwatchable !! Bad game actor! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario .. Just a good idea: that wonderful girl! It must be a mannequin without a doubt! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 minimum lines?! I do not want to waste more time to read my opinion! I hope it was clear and unstable, because English is not my native method of speaking. So, have a lot of time and watch good movies, as I also try ... Peace!
