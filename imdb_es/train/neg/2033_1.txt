If I could give you less than I would. Do not bother to rent; If someone gives you the DVD, record. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. A total waste of even digital "film". I have seen better on YouTube made by children of 12 years. Lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case, it is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story line does not exist, the dialogue is mainly the scream, the work of the camera is a kind of attempt at artistic style with nonsense cuts of jumps unrelated to industrial transport scenes or some kind of crack young and angry . <br /> <In general, I can follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" movie: I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This is very far from my limited powers of understanding. It is totally useless. I think this is a "let's see if we can take a title that will come out soon and make a weird crack in it and see if we can take some of the money" with the work. <br /> <br /> I can not see why Lionsgate bothered with this. Totally worthless, it is so bad that I will not rent any other by this same director.
