... the children actors were annoying. It also seems as if the creators of this film had difficulty filling the 90 minutes. Although the scenes of decent death. If it were not for the scenes of death, this movie would have a very Disney feel to it. <br /> <br /> The main child protagonist did not seem as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a ghostly fairy-killer ghost guy, you can bet your ass that I would not be spinning and riding my bike. <br /> <br /> In general, I have seen worse (that is, wait) but it is nothing that I would like to see again or recommend to anyone who is upset with him unless you are an avid horror collector.
