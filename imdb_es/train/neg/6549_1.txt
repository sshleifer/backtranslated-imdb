It's not that I want to be bad but this movie really surprised me a lot. Throughout the film, I was like ... erm ... what is this movie about? I do not get the animations at all. Probably this film will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film, there is a group of people who left. After the movie, many people said: "Is that all?" Frankly speaking, I can not believe that this film has been awarded the prize for the best children's film. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I recommend you do not do it. You will regret it. I'm not kidding. You will discover that you are wasting time and money from your visit.
