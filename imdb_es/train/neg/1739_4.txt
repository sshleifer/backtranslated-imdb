Seeing That Lady In Ermine, I was wondering what Betty Grable would do in a project that seemed to be directed at Marlene Dietrich. Someone in 20th Century Fox may have decided that one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck must have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays an Italian countess of the nineteenth century, whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the Palace, along with the rest From his distinguished family tree, he now does not look much like Doug and another invader, some 300 years earlier, whom he dealt with when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a very inopportune moment, before things have been completed. That will give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> The American Betty, fresh and healthy, is NOT the actress who makes the seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have put this on, but with Betty she feels flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks do not have any chemistry, although Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can see in anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment won an Oscar Nomination for Best Song. The only opportunity that Lady In Ermine had to obtain the glory of the Oscars fell in Buttons And Bows. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died halfway through the movie and Otto Preminger ended with That Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch had Grable in mind because of the leadership here. Nor will you if you see That Lady In Ermine.
