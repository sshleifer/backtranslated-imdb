Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice that she thinks is poisonous and runs away. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I've seen this for Polly Moran, whom I've seen elsewhere. Here, Moran is fine, just fine, like Dressler's cunning friend / foe. Too bad it has sunk into almost total oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is good-hearted. The bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central mechanism of the plot: the ties. This arose during the Depression, so perhaps everyone was familiar with the ties and what they can do if they are used well and if they are misused. I, however, not from that era, I am vaguely familiar with them. They are like only different existences, right? It seems strange to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
