Two sisters, his perverted brother and his cousin have problems with the car. Then they happen at the home of Dr. Hackenstein, who conveniently needs the body parts of three nubile young people to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life. He tells them he will help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor gets down to work in this low budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this a little funny, nothing at all to get out of your way (I stumbled upon that Netflix's instant view and relayed it to the xbox 360), but better than I expected it to out for a movie acquired by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but there are still some parts that made me smile. Also, the great Anne Ramsey has a small part and was always a delight to see. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Bambi Darro and Sylvia Lee Baker went topless <br /> <br /> My note: D +
