You know you're in trouble when the opening narrative basically tells you who survives. Everything goes downhill from there. It is not necessary, "Matrix" influenced the work of the camera. Useless clippings to videogame images. Crispy sea captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who become skilled fighters in the blink of an eye. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I expected at least one zombie movie "so bad that it's good", but this is "so bad that those involved in its creation should be forbidden to make a movie" again ". <br /> <br />
