I was hoping that this was a fun show, given all the hype and smart preview clips. And speaking of hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the program on BBC World Today, a program that is broadcast around the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not even come close to delivery. . All the jokes are obvious, the kind that sounds quite funny the first time you listen to them, but after that they seem unconvincing, and they are not given any new treatment or touch. All the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - good - mediocre (I'm being nice). It's the classic CBC recipe, one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are Muslim, I think you should be stupid to believe in any of the white characters, and if you are white you will probably be offended a bit by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed as intolerant. , ignorant, or both. It's not that making fun of white people is a problem, most of the best comedies are rooted in that. It's just a problem when it's not fun, like in this program. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of fun people, so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis. So, how is it that the producers of this show could not find any?
