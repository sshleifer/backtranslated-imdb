Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate the lonely movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle retires forever. It could have been titled "Bancroft Talks" while the actress assaults this uncertain comic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration. Sidney Lumet, the director of heat or cold, can not maintain a constant rhythm, and the filmmaker does not reduce the constant constant overacting of Bancroft: he keeps it in front: cute, with tearful eyes and ranting. Estelle becomes a burden in this scenario (not that the plot just conceived has many things at stake). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with little to do but support the star, and all are trampled on by their hamming. * 1/2 of ****
