I have been using IMDb for a few years now, but I have never written any reviews before. However, this movie disappointed me so much (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of this writing) that I could no longer remain silent. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by the noise pollution that an alter ego takes as a watchman, "The Rectifier", and vandalizes any car he finds with the sound of a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the film to be an inappropriate name. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise that are addressed or mentioned, the only real focus of our protagonist are car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other approach. When the film tries to relate other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems that it has just been launched to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by the noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have the inner need to bring a baseball bat to a screaming vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and almost just that fact, to sell this movie. I say "enough" because there is also a blatantly invented sexual relationship (which includes a completely unnecessary trio) that is obviously released for those who attend the film and need those things to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's impressive. <br /> <br /> The character of Robbin, very little in the movie, becomes completely unstable. It seems less that he decides not to stand the noise anymore, and more than if he concentrates so much on the noise, he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he transforms from a furious and violent guy into a hero of the little man, The Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not take place. He simply renames himself. <br /> <br /> I could continue for a while. The generalized and annoying social comments come from time to time to add more pretension to the movie, and the self-satisfied smile that never leaves Robbins's face aside does not help either. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it is very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it is quite stuck in the throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a considerable way. Only the opinion of a boy, greetings.
