A group of friends and I rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me, it has led to a horribly spent money, but also to great laughs. SICK. It is one of the best horror movies but we have rented funny. The plot is over, the set takes your friends to the forest and they never return, things are very old. The saddest part of the movie looks like your visit to the local butcher shop, except a little dirtier and bloody in the game mass that looks like meat. And if someone has ever been scared of this movie at some point where they should stay on Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good thing about the movie is that the two girls that are in it are reasonably good, one better than the other and you see them naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to see a horrible performance or rent these horrible videos, I do not find it funny, but seeing how much effort these people put in and go out so bad is hilarious and worth renting. Unless you're too mature to laugh at someone's falls. I recommend. <br /> <br /> If you rent it / buy it to laugh at it, I would give it an 8.5.
