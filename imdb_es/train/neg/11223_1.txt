I saw the movie, and I was horrified to say at least that the movie did not communicate with me as an audience. The language would put to shame the street idlers. <br /> <br /> The plot; A father who does not force any of his children to marry seems implausible. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her grandson to run into an enemy would only attract the attention of a weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the whole movie for a laugh, and laughing at my stupidity, I lost 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth seeing for the first time. <br /> <br /> I hope you save YOUR time!
