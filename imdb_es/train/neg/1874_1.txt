I have been a fervent supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw his short "Surviving Desire" in high school, and even then I was still completely immobile for his brilliant "Henry Fool". But this 10-year sequel is not only unnecessary, it's also shameful. <br /> <br /> After an agitated and quick start, "Fay Grim" becomes pseudo-intellectualism, total boredom and, finally, unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot. <br /> <br /> Most new faces are as frivolous and undeveloped as the movie: a particularly flat character ends up taking up half the time we spent with the infamous Henry Fool. And it's his only scene spoken in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's Fulbright Agent, it seems, is the only brilliant character (a play on words that Hartley probably also intended). How, then, is it left? ** SPOILER ** Killed through a car bomb, making this Hartley's most violent film to date, and tonally all wrong in a movie that is all bad. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay herself ... well, I will not ruin their destinies, since the movie makes a Good job of all that on his own (when he's not busy with another slanted angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving back from Auteur to a fucking film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not even good enough to delight in its mess. Instead, he self-indulgently inserts his director's typically fun hipster simulations into the "real world," one more ugly and bad than necessary, but not ugly enough or bad enough to approach having something that tell. In doing so, Hartley traces all my memories of these people and the wonderful world that he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I've rarely been so depressed at the movies, and I'm counting. "Leaving Las Vegas," he at least developed new characters that we grew up to love before destroying them, instead of immediately ignoring the characters who are already loved. <br /> <br /> No doubt, grim.
