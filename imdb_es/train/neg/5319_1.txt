Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a male villain who seems to have escaped from the WWF, has a terrible goal with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy he shoots burns, but when he shoots someone else ). they simply disappear) and they take the time to caress a deer. Then you have the unpleasant characters, the 30-year-old college students, an unconvincing attempt at a surprising ending and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
