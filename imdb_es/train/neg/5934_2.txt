I would not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's best fans. However, he stands out as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far, the most valuable element in this documentary is listening to Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Heater and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians who participated in the concert did not discuss the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary manner. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard greatly appreciates Rufus Wainrights' interpretations of their songs. <br /> <br /> What particularly failed in this documentary was the filmmaker's ability to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. A lot is said about it, but the viewer is not attracted to the person Leonard Cohen. This ruling is especially evident in the interviews with Bono and The Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon, but they can not translate their exact value from Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. All the live record seems like a hurried job. And as in the whole movie, only Leonard Cohen is still his part and can tell his own part. <br /> <br /> The whole montage and the script are very similar to an extramural high school project. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flashed images are not well placed. Some of the camera work is sad. Part of the score hardly remembers any association you may have expected. Sometimes it seemed that the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. Maybe a reference to its use once of LSD. <br /> <br /> A little involuntary humor ... at some point, Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. Initially, he can not remember the name of the genre, until finally he says he was punk, the punksters really caught his music. The next scene in the film is a live version of 'I can not forget' ... <br /> <br /> "And I can not forget, I can not forget that I can not forget but I do not remember who"
