Despite some oddities in the script and the value of the general curiosity of the film, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a boring and uninteresting tour to lycanthropy, saved only by the sculptural presence of the villainous Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including the hammy Naschy, are a complete cancellation (although you have to admit that the often heinous dubbing) does not help. Although the script contains enough variations on the themes of Wolf Man / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau to develop a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so weak and the dialogue so verbally ridiculous (at least in the version in English), that any latent interest in the turgid procedures soon be annulled. <br /> <br /> The address of Zabalza seems uneven, even amateur. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by the bright illumination of Villasenor. Even promising sets are photographed in such an atmospheric manner that the director's few attempts to frighten the audience are signaled well in advance. <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, although the music is excessively emphatic and emphatic. the ridiculously crude, totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
