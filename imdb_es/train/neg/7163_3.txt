<br /> <br /> At the conclusion of my "Trance" or "The Eternal" visualization, or whatever the producers call this movie, I asked myself: "Of all the bad movies I could have seen, could not I Have you seen at least one that was entertaining? "Even if a movie is not well done in terms of acting, directing, writing or whatever, it can at least be fun and, therefore, worthwhile. But not only is this film bad in artistic value, but it is incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves very slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in an attempt of entertainment with little expression, the deaths of the characters could have been great and / or bloody, but the creators of this dreck also failed in that department. <br /> <br /> What does this movie have in its favor? Almost nothing, unless you entertain yourself by watching Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, puts so little effort into his performance that he goes into self-parody mode (WHY did he decide to make this movie anyway?). br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because, God help us, there have actually been worse movies made before.
