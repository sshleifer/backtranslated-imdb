I had never heard of this before the owner of my DVD rental store mentioned it to me; Being a horror movie of the 80s with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the United Kingdom, I decided to check it. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that the dialogue is unintelligible half the time, while the performance gives a new meaning to the word inept. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film follows the terribly tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident who are protected by a dysfunctional family living in remote environments. Soon, one of the girls will seek help and never hear it again; another, still in bed, is quickly eliminated (after being forgotten most of the time). Heroin is the one that most interacts with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a mother who speaks with a bible (the supernaturality of the sign), her repressed (and suffered) daughter, and the latter's rare brother who occasionally appears in the scene to drool the females that sleep. <br /> <br /> Often resorting to reminiscences of the dinner on the part of the mother who hates the man (as a way to fill the dreary, to say nothing of originality, background story) and that invariably become in mother-daughter wrestling contests, the film has an ace up its sleeve - the end of the turn is as unexpected as it is witty, but it does little to eliminate the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (both through lameness of all this as the intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of having lost 80 minutes of my time ...
