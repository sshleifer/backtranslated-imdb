As many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but it is not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct references to the frames or movie sequences in this commentary, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I got the feeling that I was watching an episode of a television show or something, in which they had obtained a hold. of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse) ... In general, it is an insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and / or technology. . There are too many of these insulting moments to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself simply begging for everything to end, fast, halfway. In addition, there are innumerable "easy exit" scenarios, which is also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... <br /> <br /> This film fades absolutely in comparison to the old "Wargames", and I think it's a shame that they even call it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars of mine, for one thing: the performances of the actors are not so bad, considering the regurgitated garbage of a script with which they had to work. Still, they should never have signed in this movie. It's not really a career change, but I guess we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who gave the highest score for the movie ... you have to be on the payroll of the studio or something like that, that's My only explanation. <br /> <br /> To all who have not seen this: by all means, look at them and decide. But lower your expectations to the floor (and something more).
