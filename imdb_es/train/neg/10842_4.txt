Seeing the cast, I recently saw this movie at TCM, expecting a little appreciated gem, as I consider many films from the 30s. This is not a gem, not even a semiprecious one. The anachronistic outfit and the Rolls Royce limousine of the 1930s hit you right away. The casting is strange, too. But above all, there are too many silly and unnecessary plot devices. This movie has many good ingredients and a basic plot that promises, but the components do not mix according to the correct recipe. It just does not come together as it should. And that is a pity. With some quite obvious alterations, but minor, this could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American dancer (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British husband, preferably of the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and his friend, who are in a joke on a Rolls Royce owned by their friend's employer. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she sets her sights on him. This first part of the film is a light comedy without real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tone unwittingly discovers the fact that his employer is actually a fifth German columnist on the eve of World War I, and that's when the film completely changes tone and starts to crumble. Tone and Harlow are married, but just when the honeymoon begins, is killed by a type of Mata Hari (Benita Hume), and Harlow flees the scene, with a viewer accusing her of the murder of Tone. (In fact, Tone recovers from the wounds). <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where he falls in love again, this time with a rich French cad (Cary Grant). Tone, now in the military, and Harlow meet unexpectedly in the room of the hospital of Grant, where it is in rehabilitation by an air accident. In the next scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a bulldozer. Harlow never explains that the witness accused her of murder and panic! That is one of those unreal breakdowns of the plot device of a movie in history. <br /> <br /> Then, Tone also comes back in contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. She is present to see her lover, Grant, try the new plane that Tone has delivered from England. Incredibly, both Hume and Tone recognize each other tenuously, but they simply can not locate where from! Well, then Tone was shot and almost killed; Maybe his memory is a bit out of control. But how many men did Hume shoot for her to forget one of her brands? (She does not seem to be faking the lapse of memory.) <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have recognized him completely, but he was shy when he realized that Tone could not locate her. That would have been a much better treatment of that problem. <br /> <br /> The ending is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as it is made, has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad, Grant, leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone simply move away. It is noble to preserve the French public's perception of their national war hero, but very unsatisfactory as a love story! <br /> <br /> What the movie asks for is this: Harlow explains that she fled in panic in the face of murder allegations; The tone forgives her and silently revives her love for her; then he carries a torch for her, even as he helps her manipulate the crash site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for what he is. After having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow also rekindles feelings for him. At the end of the film, the two reconcile even as they work together to manipulate the emergence of Grant's death. After the burial of Grant's hero, we see them embrace and kiss each other in fainting. That would have made a nice little movie. For Cary Grant fans, it would have been even better if Tone had played with the French cad who was killed and Grant, the first husband who suffered, met with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is chosen as the Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant is chosen as the Frenchman. This movie would have been much better if they had reversed the roles. That would also have been more conducive to the movie that should have been ...
