Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said: "I missed the trip". hahaha <br /> <br /> The jokes were just terrible. The performances were medium. Something went terribly wrong with the movie. Emraan totally deserved something better. All CELINA JAITLEY did was expose. Hrishitta bhatt was fine. Emraan Hashmi was also fine. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. therefore, he uses RADHA and pretends that he loves her, only because his father is a music director and could help him become famous (since the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely in love with his appearance and tries to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then, that night ROME can not open the door of her room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not do it either, ROMA will ask for help. While she is not there, MANN can open the door and decides to enter and sits on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA enters and they have an adventure of one night. However, on that night, ROMA falls in love with him. That morning, come to the underworld don (MAHESH) who sees everything. The gift loves ROMA and he could not stand what he saw. He orders them to get married, and frightened, MANN obeys Merry's order and ROMA. Then, news of their marriage ends up in the newspaper. Later, MANN discovers that he loves ROMA after making a music video together. Now he is caught between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also impressive. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
