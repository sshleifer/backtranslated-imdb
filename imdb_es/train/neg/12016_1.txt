If Bob Ludlum were to see this mini-series, he would have cried. This was a complete waste of time and money. I have read the book and although the films are not exactly what the book can be, CBS lost time and money in this and it is shameful to claim that this was a Ludlum work. <br /> <br /> It may be the creator should check Bourne's identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the television series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to lower themselves so low? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
