Horrible, horrible, horrible, do not waste your money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget made for the Canadian television movie. Absolutely the worst movie I've seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines?) The performance was horrible, it had absolutely no flow, I saw the film made for television on the BTK killer and it was much better (compared to this one) .I am not sure what they were doing. to produce this film, but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they had lost by a mile, it seemed to be more of an infomercial for animal rights.
