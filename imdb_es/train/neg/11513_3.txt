* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I doubled back to be fair with this movie. I knew it starring Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew I had a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a deep and reflective examination of class, culture and sexuality as we did in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted a total of ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious and naive Gorgon who goes on vacation with her husband and her impertinent friends (the brunette is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some very silly facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first officer of the ship, in which the character of Madonna delights in humiliate and treat as trash in each scene they have together. Why is she so bitch with him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later, when the two are isolated on a desert island in the Mediterranean, the tables turn and he teaches a lesson. So inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having mutually mistreated each other during two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a silly, simplistic and superficial film, from start to finish. finish. Madonna gives a typically wooden performance. There are many silly scenes: Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the request of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the ass. Guy Ritchie makes his "elegant" edition, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a major film in several years. The ending is boring and implausible. It is basically that "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove that she is a competent actress. Please, leave it, Madge, for our good and yours. Although this is not your worst movie. That distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She has not done anything worse than that ... yet.
