In general, I only comment on the movies that I like, thinking of "each one to your liking", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which somehow seems to get lost in the confusion, is that these two self-centered adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry and inflict incalculable suffering on their respective children. Even taking into account culturally sanctioned drunkenness, they do not have the courage or sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? To hell with everyone else. If things "work at the end" is not really the point; in fact it is quite irrelevant. The point is that the lack of respect for others, especially if they are young people, and especially if they are in a position of dependence, is done lightly and, therefore, is reinforced with this film. There are far more innocuous behaviors that these "parents" could have realized that they would have brought down an army of social workers in the blink of an eye.
