I hated it. If you think that everyone in the South is stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, religious or a child molester, this movie may be for you. All are poor and apparently ignorant. In one scene, two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had upset a group of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenage girl walks on the back roads in search of her sister and no one offers to help her, despite a clear lameness and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only totally disgusting and viscous, but he shows himself as a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. A scene from the film is very reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (DeNiro's): the biblical verses that the bad guy emits. I'm from the Great Northwest, but this movie seemed offensive to me because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
