The long list of "big" names in this film (including the omnipresent John Mills) did not comment on me to the extent that I could not judge the film by its real merits. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, set from the humble hero of air-as to the steering wheel of yank. The music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie was over: loud, growing crescendo, great blossoming and ending, then silence, but then the movie continued! I did not find a real story, a careless writing, but smartly pressed uniforms and pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose work) with a little bit of excitement. I can not say that this image has any of the ingredients that make a film great. I found him maudlin, mawkish and minor.
