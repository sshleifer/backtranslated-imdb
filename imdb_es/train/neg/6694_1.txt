In fact, I had hopes for this film, since I've seen Kari in some other things and I think she has some talent. Unfortunately, this failure is a case study on what not to do in a script. Characters completely undefined without a hint of sympathy, and without any plot. Is it a path / friend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and neither do we.
