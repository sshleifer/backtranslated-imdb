I've seen this movie several times and I never thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and it's good to laugh. <br /> <br /> These are women who work in a company and their boss is an imbecile and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and they try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those stars of the 80 who plays a bad guy, is not really evil, but unpleasant. Dolly Partin is adorable and fun to watch in comedies and her southern wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is regular and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best of this movie, has the funniest phrases and made me laugh out loud several times, I have to love her. <br /> <br /> I could recommend this to anyone who likes the comedy of the 80s. I like the movie but it has things that I do not like. It starts off wonderfully, it has a nice flow and then everything starts to unite at once and makes me worry less about the characters. All of them have little fantasies about what they would like to do to the boss and, although "cute", I thought that the speed of the movie slowed down. As the movie progresses, it once again recovers and the funniest things happen, and then once again it slows down, only to end up in a quick way that is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 Stars, but try it if you have not seen it. I think that depending on the mood can be more or less pleasant.
