If you have read the original novel, as I did, you will probably hate this. <br /> <br /> The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of anachronisms from the 80s that try to create a set of "period pieces" in the late 1950s and do not recreate or even pay homage to that period, the American monstrosity of _Dirty Dancing_ is similar to 1963, except that the film had a financial success despite having equally amateur screenwriting. In addition to suffering for "looking too 80's", the characters have been changed, reorganized and minimized to the point that the only characteristics that have in common with those of the novel are the milder surface appearances and, of course, their characteristics. names: Suze has been transformed from the ex-girlfriend of the narrator and the promiscuous negrofila who voluntarily plans to marry an old closet queen for money (in her first admission in the first pages) to a hapless and naive "Eva", a type of character seduced by fame and glamor, exploited and somehow cheated in a marriage simulated by his boss, who surprisingly did not receive a Van Dyke and a pointed hairdo. She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (by the book's author, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The character of Big Jill, a lesbian apparently butch "however, like" in her mid-20s, who acts like a pimp for a group of young, bubble-headed lesbians, and one of the narrator's closest friends, dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator, is reduced to a kind of "extra name" with only a few disposable lines, and tons of comical outfits. <br /> <br /> The fabulous Hoplite, a young gay man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point of being useless in the movie. , camped and almost ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad minor character, but in the film, he has become an optimistic and strangely animated character despite the squalid neighborhood, and the mess of his marriage with the mother of the narrator it seems, for all practical purposes, ignored. <br /> <br /> In your favor, the music (for what it is) is well composed, and you have to give credit to the production and writing teams for taking a line from the book ("... some days , they will write musicals about the 1950s ... ") as their inspiration to write. a musical, but in the world of misplaced musicals, this is one of the most poorly performed in the group. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, the crucial elements of the plot are treated as later thoughts. Unlike _La Manzana_, there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can not really blame the "eighty plus" for the fact that it was created in the eighties. The film version of _Annie_, released in 1981, pays a beautifully executed homage to the appearance of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture an aspect and feel of the 1980s despite having been made in a low budget in 2003 (although not explicitly established in the 1980s, those who lived the decade can not deny that the film "feels very much like the 1980s"). Obviously, it was possible to do something good about this, especially considering the iconic status that the original novel has in the UK, but it apparently fails in the appearance and treatment of the original material, which is Absolutely disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you have not read and you do not intend to read the novel, you could enjoy this anachronism of the 1980s giving a shameful parody of the Soho London modernist jazz set of the end of the decade from 1950. I can definitely see what the writing team was trying, but they definitely could have done better. With Boy George as a household name and musicians and mixed-race bands on the 1986 charts in the UK, they definitely did not have the need to intimidate the characters the way they ended. In fact, I would say that the writers ended up doing what both the book and the film criticized harshly: ended up having a group of adults who treated poorly and treated their target audience of teenagers as if they were two bits. idiots to make a quick money from.
