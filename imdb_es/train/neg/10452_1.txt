I saw the 10p.m. Showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater wanting to return (since I no longer pay for the movies) I really did not find any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and that made me chuckle, but for the most part the movie seemed to consist of rampant fan service for the younger ones (in mind, more than age, since this movie is classified as R) for the male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and also quite distracting. I know everyone wants to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a big hype for very little in return. The only truly horrible part of the movie was the CG, which looked very digitized and did not fit well with the live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable man, I knew that I was going to the theater that was not going to see "Casablanka", and at least I am grateful that this film is an original idea (of albiet inane) and not a new one version of the franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the cult, it is probably best to spend your money elsewhere and see the movie in a second theater in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
