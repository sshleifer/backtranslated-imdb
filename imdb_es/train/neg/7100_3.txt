This movie has a promising start and then it gets confused and confused. Kamal Hasan has made a great effort to make the period look good, pity that he has not spent more time in the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie appear for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
