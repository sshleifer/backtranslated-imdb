When the movie begins, a narrator warns us that THE CRANE FOR AN AGING is so terrifying that it could die of fear, and if that happens a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone has died of fear to see this movie, but some may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her house, she is tormented by a half gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks and, ultimately, a skull that rolls around the room and makes her scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, your ability to do so is the highest point of the movie. The plot is quite transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is really good, the script is terrible and the film is so uninspired that it will be ready to run screaming. It's true, the thing only lasts about sixty-eight minutes, but everything feels much longer. Add to this a really terrible print quality and there it is. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad that they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has some howlers, but the film creeps so much that I could not do more than an occasional giggle, and by the time it's all over your head, it will roll off ennui. If it were not for the way of Peggy Webber with a scream, this would be the safe cure for insomnia. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
