There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest piece of talent. Nobody in him has tried to act before, even the extras in the cafeteria seem stuck in place. Nothing seems rehearsed. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the "action" takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crowded as a late occurrence, swinging a cheap camera to one side and another among "actors" as they deliver their lines. Without an adequate tripod or microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even 'Hands' is doing better than this, at least they had the right equipment. The plot there is simply lost in the disorder of production. <br /> <br /> Adhere to the home videos, preferably made by a 5-year-old boy who tests the video function on the new dad's camera phone. A long search awaits you to find a more inept movie than this one.
