In a word: unbearable. I was recommended to read some articles about the philosophical meanings of this movie afterwards, but after spending 115 minutes of the film and being slowly crushed by its bulky symbolism and the oppressiveness that flows from the lava, it seemed best to report my reactions to the film . After all, who will watch a movie with a program in hand? And this movie was sad. The main actor Claude Laydu, from the opening of the film until its end, wears the same mask of agony, annoying and annoying, that is practically indistinguishable from the eternal and sad voice in off of the film. Filming one over the other might have worked better than submitting both to an audience, since they basically say the same thing: Ambricourt's priest is a miserable human being. The story, about a persecuted priest trying to help a wealthy family with problems, does nothing to make his characters remotely interesting or sympathetic, since the family is a group of rare unpleasant bugs, and the priest himself presents himself like a curious plague. The last 30 minutes suggest an amazing message about the grace and suffering of a man equal to the others, but due to all the lenient close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's script, all that I felt it was, finally, It's over, let's have some ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fan Paul Schrader, just to see how many character elements and Schrader settings were incorporated into his own scripts and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
