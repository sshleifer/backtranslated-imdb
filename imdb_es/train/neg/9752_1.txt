Honestly, I can not believe what is happening for entertainment now. Death (and mocking death), violence, sexual innuendos, adults threatening children, cruelty, underage drinking, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotyped jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, and children running away from home in the middle of the night - yes, it sure sounds like a movie to children - NO! Add to that the dark and frightening elements: a dead woman who owns and turns a house and keeps her beloved husband imprisoned inside for more than 20 years, and also terrorizes a whole neighborhood, which is sweet for children. PARENTS: Is this really what you want your children to see? Is this what you want to teach them about life ?! <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for young children, and I'm afraid that teenagers today may be living something from this movie setting, so why rub on their faces? As for an adult audience, it will not seem scary or funny, just boring, contrived and predictable. And the characters are simply wrong: clueless parents, ignorant policemen, stupid and annoying friends, unpleasant and manipulative nannies, and boy / girlfriend / beer drinkers. What great material for children? Does this really sound like a movie for children? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to exchange this terrible movie. Save money, save time and save the minds of your children: go to rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life: ANY of them is much better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis: a pity for both for making such a disaster and then seeing it as a children's / family movie!
