A good amount of running around. An adversary ill conceived with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications sending signals to space and receives them, encounters extraterrestrials. Along with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and is given secrets about them. It becomes rather treacherous in the process. Granted, you are given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long stretches where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we're usually following a car, a trip through a forest, investigating a building. This is what the edition is about. I guess the story would not technically support much more. There is not much here.
