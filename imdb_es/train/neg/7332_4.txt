Despite being a 2001 film, the direction is the style of the art house of the 90s that was considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. The cuts and effects of cheese were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and some scenes captivated me (like when the taxi driver takes her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective that the sister committed suicide and how obsessed with suicide was simply terrible. The acting of the actor who plays the married boyfriend of Selma Blair bothered me seriously. However, I sat through the whole thing, which is weird in the kind of random movie that is on TV and decides to watch.
