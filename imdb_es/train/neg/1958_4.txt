Where to start This movie started as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls" scam. A disfigured old woman who lives in the forest and gives gifts to children. Sounds familiar? Then change. In "Darkness Falls," the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and his sister? I think the movie would have been fine without them. It seems that the producers sat down and decided they needed to put more people in the movie so that the tooth fairy had people to kill. Although, it is good to see a pretty blonde girl who is not portrayed as a bubble head for a change. It's fine to rent, but I would not suggest buying it.
