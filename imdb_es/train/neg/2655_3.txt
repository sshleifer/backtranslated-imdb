** 1/2 of this farce by Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton, enough with her philosophy and Annie Hall hats. <br /> <br /> This movie is too much for Sara, Keaton's daughter, to die in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who could not be contacted by phone at first, since she was in the bag with her friend and had taken out the telephone plug, regrets a new way for those who complain. <br /> <br /> He retires to the summer place where all Sara's friends are staying. She cleans the house, sleeps two days and then begins to reveal things that it was better not to reveal. It seems that the sweet Sara went to bed with her girlfriend and the boy who finally married the latter. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now on this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find the slippery diary that Sara kept. She also hopes that her boyfriend, Adam, who is a playwright, does not include all this in another play. <br /> <br /> When the diary is found, it has been written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D. in this language. It's not great news for mom when a Japanese cook translates an excerpt from the diary into a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Naturally, everything seems to fit very well in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara talked, they both uttered a surrender of Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if this were not enough, during the course of this strange mourning extravaganza, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen. in his film, Interiors, where he tried to emulate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Ms. Keaton also tests drugs with the group. Come on, folks, can we really believe that someone in their right mind could cry like that? <br /> <br /> The best of the mediocre is summarized by this movie.
