I've been on the lookout for a couple of years or so. I've never been moved to post here before, so maybe this movie is worth a star, but I doubt it. I just saw it on DVD, I lost it in the movies due to an illness and I could never see it until now. I had not read much about this, I certainly had not even thought about the movie in a few months. It was just what the friend picked up at the store, for what he saw. <br /> <br /> Serious error. <br /> <br /> The photo I mentioned in the summary above is in the trailer and on the poster. From the beginning, Jason Statham has hair. As in no other GR film. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the amounts shown here. And Ray Liotta in his underpants SHOULD be warned. It is scary and funny, but not in a fair way. It's more of an almost-TheOffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failed-of-humor way. Everyone says the same thing: "This movie does not look like anything you expect this movie to be." <br /> <br /> Now, based on the extensive previous experience of watching movies, I expected this movie to be a few things. I like: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or interesting, <br /> <br /> () It's not a complete and absolute farrago of looking at the navel , <br /> <br /> () Something more substantial than a motley group of misconceived fables of what is simply a standard oriental mystical ideology disguised as a "fresh, modern and self-conscious artistic form", <br /> < br /> () Hopefully it's better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed from my tone, none of the boxes above could be marked. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Wrong edited {I go through the whole shop, amateur high jump cuts of the 70s high level, incomprehensible "plot" "twists !!!" delivered through pirated flash-back mounts, I could continue ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Taken as if I were a 14-year-old depressed Goth who had just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with the drawn curtains <br /> <br /> (x) So, behind it, appears the motive / message "I am very smart, I", which feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that stupid people (that is, all those who do not like them) in the audience make sure they get the point, <br /> <br /> (x) A genuine loss of my time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the undoubted ability of some people to "get" some of this, fine. I am happy you have enjoyed. A poster said something that caught my attention: people under 25 probably understood it better because of the editing. Maybe, but the edition is supposed to make your work more accessible, not less. As for the "enlightened brigade", the genius is only recognized there, go to suck an onion and grow. There is nothing more presumptuous and selfish than people who say that the reason why another person does not know great works of art is because they do not understand the "art / materials / the lunar cycle / the filaments of the supreme rational thought" that the "author / author" poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant 'is using to explain his' vision / grand scheme / unit with Gea / big big bucket of dog sick'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many More people, their trash. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be seen by another human is supposed to be attractive and moving. In some direction, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever it is that you have. <br /> <br /> The only way this made me move forward was in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable demise. "The biggest trick he ever did was to make you believe that any part of this movie meant Anything at all." <br /> <br /> And now, please, toast my buns for me.
