There is nothing new to say: 4 hours of people dying again and again on the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God scoffed. He must have eaten a humble cake (if it were not for his own good, then for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant directors of Bollywood, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who was not related to him in any way (and who seemed to have heard some bad version of "Apocalypse Now" in some cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional team, threw all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, he, like the big shots of the Army of India, made decisions that were terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all die again and again. <br /> <br /> Please, do not do that again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: the next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest that he hire more than one Nepalese to represent the team. Surely there are many Nepali men working in Bombay; the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
