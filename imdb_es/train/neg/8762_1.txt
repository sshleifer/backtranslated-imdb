A scientist (John Carradine, sadly) discovers how to give life back to the dead. However they return with marble faces. Eventually, all this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Bored and totally predictable departure from the forties. This scared me when I was a kid, but now it bores me. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, the acting is horrible. Such boring actors without expression! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are some slightly creepy moments that involve a ghost of a great Dane walking along the walls. There is also one of the worst looking knockouts in the history of cinema. However, none of this is funny enough to sit through this. Avoid.
