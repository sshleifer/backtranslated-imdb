When I saw the previews of this movie, I did not expect much to start, around a horror movie for second-rate teenagers. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And that is being generous. <br /> <br /> First, the casting for the movie was terrible. You do not feel sympathy (or, for that matter, any morbid feeling) for the characters. The performance was so terrible that I was just waiting and waiting for God's terrible thing to end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the movie that have absolutely no relation to the plot. Can someone explain to me why the girl-looking boy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs as he enters the movements of Jackie Chan that he had never seen before, and even more biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the father of the child proceed to get angry with the man infected with the virus, and go hunting to look for him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and disbelief that I literally said out loud: "Where the hell did that come from?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I had seen. I really thought that I had seen some bad movies, but I must say that Cabin Fever surpasses them all. This movie made me want to throw up and then throw up again. Then blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please, save an hour and a half and do something more productive. See the grass grow, maybe, is a suitable alternative.
