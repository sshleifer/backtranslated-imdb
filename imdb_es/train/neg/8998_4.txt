Stephen Feinberg, who played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the film, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year later when he told me he had been a writer in Hollywood years before. , working mainly in television promotions. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had seen it! Actually I had seen it years before, when it was released. At that time I did not think a movie was so bad. However, seeing him as an adult, my opinion was something different. Yes, it's a bit childish as well as antiquated. Steve admitted that it was not a very good movie. That said, I was just a little proud of the sketch of 'The Proctologist'.
