It's a joke! This was one of the worst movies I've seen! It was so bad, however, that it was hilarious. My friend and I hired it on purpose because it looked so bad. The old horror movies are good for laughing. The plot reeked, some of the voices were doubled, the quality was horrible. But surely I had a great time watching it!
