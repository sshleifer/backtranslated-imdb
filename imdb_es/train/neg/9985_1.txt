Have I ever seen a more surprisingly inept movie? I can think of an amount equal to this, but none that can overcome it. The cast are all horrible agglomerated stereotypes with a flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Each one carries an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but realizing that this project could easily nullify his career. Even the many charms of Mrs. Diaz do not provide an adequate reason to submit to this. Avoid, it's obviously a movie style that Americans have not really understood. Look at the final result if necessary, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you ...
