Most movies I can easily see, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the kind of person who recognizes great movies, even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to see. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen many movies. The acting is fine (Myers is good as the cat, it's just really annoying). The silly songs that the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children of the audience. The plot goes on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The "witty" comments of parents are disgusting, not funny (I remember a horrible comment about comparing a garden hoe with, well, a type of person people call "ho"). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know little children who hated this movie. If children can not stand it, I do not know how adults can do it. I would like to smoke more about this movie, but I do not even feel like wasting more time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars: the lowest revision I've ever given to a movie.
