I really wanted to see this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghainese, so there was more than a passing interest in the subject. However, after seeing it, I felt extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie was unbearably slow and monotonous. The director was delayed in certain scenes for too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. The dialogue was very necessary to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie, you did not feel compassion for the characters. This movie was missing everything. The script was weak, the acting was bad and the editing did not exist. The director tried to emulate certain styles of black cinema, but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which it captures your attention, maintains it and manages to conclude without you feeling that time has passed. This movie seemed like it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
