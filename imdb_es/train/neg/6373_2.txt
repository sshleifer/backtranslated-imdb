Oh, this was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is fine, but I think she's acting badly in the movie, not because her raven rips off her organs at night, but because she's thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this shit. . Faye Dunaway acts as if she were remaking Mommy Dearest and the ending is completely silly. I can not really recommend this movie at all, although as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was a little intrigued by references to his work (Ravens, the familiar curse of the House of Usher, and I was buried alive). He would probably turn around in his grave if he knew about this movie.
