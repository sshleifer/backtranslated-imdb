This movie is absolutely horrible, but in spite of everything, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is not intentional. <br /> <br /> The plot was more than ridiculous. I do not even think that a 2-year-old boy is convinced by the ridiculous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to slap a story. However, on the positive side, some of the horribly inane plot twists provide a lot of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I'll spare you. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally laughable. Most of the children's roles are nice, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is pretty horrible in general. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but this is very much a good thing. If they had tried to be credible, the movie would have been even worse. What is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you get over the overall mood of the movie, there are actually some highlights of almost nothing at all. The scene in which the son of Lady Hogbottom flees with the maid is surprisingly funny, although it is an annoying disappointment when the police catch them. The character of the butler, although very small, is a ray of sun that almost, but never crosses the penumbra. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. However, there were some redeeming parts that made it almost visible without beginning to suffer an internal hemorrhage. Judging by his good parts alone, the movie would be about a 5; unfortunately, the rest of the movie just deserves a 1. So, I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> That's pretty generous, I would say.
