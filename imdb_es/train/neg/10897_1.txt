This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen! It was stupid that there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous! And I've never seen such a bad performance in my life! The only good part of the movie were all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people thought when they made this movie! I did not even want to finish everything because you get to this point in the movie where all the boys are in bed touching themselves. I mean, it was like a sick and twisted kind of child pornography! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it, just forget about it and look for another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.
