I've seen better teen werewolf movies in my time, however, this takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" in the cheese festival. The quality of the star in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was made ends up sending rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a football player from the 1950s who ended up without getting old due to the bite of a werewolf in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violinist. He drove everyone crazy! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who knew the end of his own bullet. Alan, Adam's father, plays a psychiatrist who does not seem to be the best in his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he will have the opportunity to catch him in his state. More laughter than spilled blood, this movie is only the beginning in the 80s. "Teen Wolf" was an improvement on this. 1 out of 5 stars
