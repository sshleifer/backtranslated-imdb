OK, this movie was really "unique", let's say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented of the movie, although she is said to have had a problem with coca during the movie. but she said she can not remember much of that. Well, that's your excuse, but what is everyone else's? I can not imagine that everyone had a coca problem. Whatever was not so bad, I guess the plot was good and had some fun moments. although the part in which the boy put that thing in his head was too violent for my taste. Oh, well, I guess I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so amazing and this movie did not do anything for her.
