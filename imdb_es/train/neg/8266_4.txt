What the hell is with this movie? Could not they have a better script? In general, a "nice" movie, but ... it's been done more than once ... Until the end, I thought it was fine, but ... going back to the previous part ... * Barf * BOTH .. I was waiting for the god fairy god to appear ... but wow, that did not happen ... what is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but I saw a movie of this kind in a new way with another child who wanted me to be older / older; that's so happened <br /> <br /> Just watch until it comes on TV. Do not get me wrong, but it's not all that.
