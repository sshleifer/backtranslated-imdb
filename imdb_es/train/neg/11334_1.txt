Here is another blasphemous European story in which they criticize the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic). <br /> <br /> Actually, he won an Academy Award for a foreign film. Probably because history made Catholics and religious belief in general seem extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as nothing more than an idiot. No wonder that the Academy dominated by the laity loved this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is an exaggerated fool who plays a man who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters that appear in the story. The daughters take turns seducing the student of the "seminary" (who says he studied for six years but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, what blasphemy IS this movie? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another excellent example of the secular-progressive fanaticism of the film business around the world (not only in Hollywood).
