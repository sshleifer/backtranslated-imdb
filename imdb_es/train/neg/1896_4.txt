This movie does not show us anything original. Each idea or scene (action) can be found in many movies previously released. Fabulous Nick is completely simple here. Even Will Patton is quiet and evil or good. Mr. Duvall is fine, but he has a very small part. So, Angelina, how can we determine your recently acclaimed stardom? In general, there are too many characters, so no one and nothing is especially detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. Very bad, do not you think?
