What do you get when you mix a group of clichés with a non-directed rhythm and a group of characters you do not care about and an unsuccessful attempt to create an appealing visual style and an even larger group of clichés and a weak sense of humor? And a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most intolerable movies that have ever been made! I mean, of course, Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people could say during the visualization of this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the story is told out of sequence, it has not been done a billion times before, and much more skillfully than in this movie. " <br /> <br /> "Wow, look at all the blinking lights and the texture of the grainy film and make the transitions! The director strives to make things look artistic and to establish a visual style. a pity that none of these effects add anything to the film or make sense with the scenes they are in, and it's also very bad, most of them are irritating! "<br /> <br />" I've I listened to that dialogue exchange in some twenty thousand films before! <br /> <br /> "I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" This one too! "<br /> <br />" Uh, did not you reveal this 'plot twist' about an hour ago? Is that supposed to be surprising? "<br /> <br />" If this movie is supposed to be showing a 'tough girl' going around kicking her ass ... why does not she do a lot of that? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how unoriginal this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I feel like I've been seeing it for more than four hours. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but I'm not particularly motivated to try to find out. "<br /> <br />" Is this over? "<br /> <br />" I want to get my money back ". <br /> <br />" The songs on this soundtrack feel so badly used here. "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the curses they use actually detract from the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH ". <br /> <br /> And finally:" I may have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. "<br /> <br / > In summary, this film is a failure in almost all aspects, avoid seeing it at all costs If your house is on fire and this film is played in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider burning yourself alive. <Br / > <br /> (If it sounds bitter, it's because I just spent more than two hours watching this movie and, uh, I did not really enjoy it.
