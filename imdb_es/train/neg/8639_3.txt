Routine thriller about a sociopath (Dillon) who delivers his sperm to a human reproduction clinic and begins to harass the lives of the woman (Antonio) and her husband (Mancuso). Extremely predictable, preposterous and with an indecisive tone all the way. Do not waste your time with this ... make a baby instead!
