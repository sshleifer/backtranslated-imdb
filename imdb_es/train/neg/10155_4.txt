I have read several good reviews that have defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, again and again, is the annoyance of Megan, the idealistic political scientist, who tries to change the world. I loved your character. Maybe, because I'm a political science student of 23 years and I think I'm also going to change the world, so I relate to Megan. Besides, she is cute. She's not a super model, but she's more of a pretty girl next door. <br /> <br /> It's okay, so he cried and cried a lot. It is very dramatic and seems exaggerated, but does not fit with his character? Follow that program with the intention of sacrificing your life to prove a point. She thinks that people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, being a naive young woman, she is terrified by what she is about to face. I think that acting accurately portrays a young woman who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Also, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation in which she found herself. <br /> <br /> As for the film in general, apart from Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It had excellent gore scenes, by micro-budget standards. The plot maybe took a quick thought, almost no contemplation. Basically it's just a slasher movie with no sense of dark humor, as the name implies. I love the sadism of the doctor. He continued to tear Megan's shirt off, not only for the cause of the misconduct (though to a large extent), but also for tormenting her, before he killed her. The wick of the chainsaw was hilarious. For lovers of slasher cinema, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. I had a good stage, almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but almost a diamond in the rough that is a horror of micro budget.
