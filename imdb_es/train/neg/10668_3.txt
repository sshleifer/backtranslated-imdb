This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act. I expected the film to improve as it progressed, but the performance was so robotic that it was doomed from the start. In fact, it seemed that maybe the actors were reading a script all the time. Maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure: the makeup artist needs another job! The facial powder was so thick you could see it on the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it is not surprising that it never reached the theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods, is ashamed of you for not giving everything. The plot was great, I just needed a lot more.
