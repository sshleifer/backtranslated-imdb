I was very excited to see that they had made a movie of my favorite book. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was horrified by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a movie with the report of a 4th grade book about the novel. Meg did well in school and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not represented as a scientist at all; They put aside their kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. And that is just the beginning. Halfway through the film I found myself screaming on the screen, to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who had not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs to be able to give four thumbs down for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is quite good.
