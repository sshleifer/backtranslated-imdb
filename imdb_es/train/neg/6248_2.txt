Something very strange happens when we talk about Global Warming: science goes out the window and "belief" and "consensus" become the topic of discussion. <br /> <br /> It is because of this fact that I give a negative mark to Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting an intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world and spend billions of dollars to "stop global warming", it may be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much of the current warming was caused by the humans. Maybe none of that, maybe some of that, or maybe it's over the next Ice Age and we were very lucky not to have boiled the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact is that we do not. to know. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "create" in the "consensus". Noollaesa that any differential scientist introducci√≥ngine the "consensus "EST. It does not matter that scientific research is about deviating from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, neither Copernicus nor Galileo. <br /> <br /> So, why do I despise those same researchers who would advance in the field asking the difficult questions? If global warming is so incontrovertible, surely some people who prove that theory can not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What is happening here? That's the movie I hoped Al Gore would have done. Instead, he chose to shore up his support with the true "believers" of the "consensus." <br /> <br /> Sorry, really.
