I can not say that this is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. But, again, I can not say that it is one of the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> Well, basically a girl skates, she's good at that, she wants to go to an expensive school, she can not afford it and she has to take a hockey scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress who plays Katelin. He absolutely could not cry to save his life, he just moaned, like a child pretending to cry to get his own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to act kind and helpful with people. Also the part where the two skaters are calling their names and saying something about their choreographer and she says "draw the line" made me tremble. <br /> <br /> We all knew where I would go with her and Spencer. Classically, they did not like each other and the type of meeting at the end was typical. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a movie to see if you like to skate, but if you do not mind the main skater is extremely annoying. It's good to basically kill time.
