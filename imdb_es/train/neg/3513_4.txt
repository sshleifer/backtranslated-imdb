Jeremy Northam fights a cloning script "Total Recall" and a disposable romantic game to give life to a confused character. Lucy Liu graduates her performance from a wooden beginning to a finish similar to a worker. You can not stop laughing when you watch your interviews on the DVD when you use the term "Fatal Woman" and "Romance." She is not a French actress and they do not have chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or in the action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in the photography and ham films. Representation of the world of technology that surrounds the main protagonists. A small attempt is made to dress the stage to represent any landscape or contiguous film period. The cars are very modern and the architecture is almost modern, with open plans that point to a restricted budget instead of conscious preparation techniques. <br /> <br /> Technology is positively fun. Massive mainframes "2001: a space odyssey" powered by portable CD-ROMs with data compiled for some unexplained reason, despite the growing communications network that even the most distrustful technologist of today would be aware of. There is a clear lack of research done here and given the open source nature of the cyber community, the research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time. <br /> <br /> The DVD interviews also reveal the original the name of the film was "The man of the company", but it was probably abandoned to take advantage of the exaggerations of the Matrix. The title "Cypher" has only the least link to the movie. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely rewrote the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of Tele-movie and it is extremely disappointing for a feature film production. I could have done a good secondary plot for "Alias."
