As a fan of Altman, I had searched for this movie for years, thinking that with such a good cast, it would have to be at least slightly bright. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of the major setbacks of Altman, organized randomly and improvising (or so it feels) with the hope that everything comes together in the editing room. It is not like this. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable only for the debut of Alfre Woodard, who eclipses the veterans around him. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is quite easy to do, it has never been published on video, as far as I know, and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's comet).
