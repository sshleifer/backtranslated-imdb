This movie was not scheduled in Italian cinemas, I've seen it in a demonstration called "fantafestival". It seems terrible to me because some scenes seem like chaotic and dark music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspense in the cinema. movie. The music is completely out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is interesting but the development needs a complete overhaul.
