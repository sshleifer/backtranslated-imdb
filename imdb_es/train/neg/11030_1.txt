I recently saw this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest, it was one of the worst movies I've had the misfortune to see. Do not get me wrong, there are bad fun and entertaining movies (eg, "Hands of Fate of Destiny") and then there are really bad movies. (This falls in the last category). The cinematography was amazing, and not in a good way. It felt as if the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a free nipple socket), the lighting was something between "a guy running with a light bulb" and "non-existent". The actors were as bad as the actors in the soap but not as much as the actors in the porn, and they gave the impression that each line surprised them completely. The only redeeming feature was the appearance of the masked assassin, a classic look Jason Vorhees style of "Friday the 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie should not be seen, or maybe an insomniac who needs sleep.
