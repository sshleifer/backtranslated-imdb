This is so bad, very, very bad. Acting is the greatest joke in history. I did not even bother to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was as disappointing at the end as at the beginning ... I really do not understand the taste of the people, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm not annoying, but I have a limit! Maybe it was a better star room than the start of The Hoast, but that's it. That's why I recommend you not waste the 15 minutes you can see. I mean, the performance is better done by the monkeys. And the older brother with the father role is just horrible. Do not pay the characters in movies C? No, I must say that this is not the first time I think a horror movie is bad, but it is absolutely one of my ten films and it will be a charing place with Portrait of a vampire, Cabin by the lake, The Hoast.
