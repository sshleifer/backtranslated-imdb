"Show me your boobies!" It's not fun, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think like that or listen to that. It seems sad to me that Nick has promoted this crap SO MUCH, and that's what we have, stupid children who act like stupid adults. I know it is meant to be funny, but we consider that we have sweet and innocent girls in K and 1st grade who can not wait to see this. I had to comment how disappointed I was when I saw him. My daughters will not be seeing it. I'd love to block Nick, but I do not have a heart right now, but if Nick keeps throwing this kind of trash, I'll have to do it.
