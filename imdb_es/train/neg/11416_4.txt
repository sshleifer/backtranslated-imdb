The fact that this film has been entitled to the most successful film in Switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! It is true, but regrettable at the same time. A film about the Swiss army could be much better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting, at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in church, married to his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter) . <br /> <br /> Somehow, the performance does not differ from the few recruits who get drunk and stone in reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as mediocre Michelle Bluntschi, I personally found her quite upset. <br /> <br /> The story contains a comedy combined with a romance, which does not work as expected. The romance part is too trashy, and the comedy part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap attempt and it does not change throughout the whole movie. It's fun for pre-teens ages 12 to 13, but not for those looking for an entertaining comedy. Humor is weak except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a suitable comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not yet acquitted your military training, and still do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I will give you 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time. Although there is not much time on the screen
