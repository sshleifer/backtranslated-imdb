Adapting works to the cinema is often a bad idea because they are two different media. Do you think it's a great idea to turn ZULU into a play? Imagine where two brave redcoats sit in a tent panting "Blimey there are thousands of them out there" A great movie and a bad play <br /> <br /> For a play to make a great cinema , you need two essential elements <br /> 1) A fine cast that is created in the chemistry of the screen <br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> About the Paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting option, but not in these roles. The story revolves around a hitman played by Palminterri who breaks into a house to kill a wife played by Cher and that most of the action takes place inside the house. I could not take these two characters seriously, although maybe it was the script's fault that I can not decide if I was trying to be serious or funny. Given that the story is very static, it is very important that the dialogue shine and, once again, due to the strange tone of the script, it embarrasses more than anything else, since a large part of the conversation revolves around sexual acts .
