I agree with most of the other guys. A waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is worth the paper it was written on. The only highlight of my point of view is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This recalls the old days with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the performances of the actors, since most of them do not even seem to have a good time during the production and simply "do their thing". The camera is fine, the plot is ridiculous, I think you would be embarrassed if you discussed this with lots of beers. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I yawned all the time, I wondered how a script like this could even be considered for production and wait for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son was happy, but at this age he is happy with so little :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, A 1 point rating here is almost 1 point too ...
