You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not particularly want it, a man who produces budget horror after budget horror at less enthusiastic receptions. But keep doing the same. Even the half-hearted compliments surrounding his Camp Blood films are grudging and I'm as guilty as anyone. Brad usually manages to throw something interesting in the mix, a good idea, a crazy character, whatever, but without the funds to take it beyond the basic level, he trusts that the audience will distract him a bit and appreciate him what it is. and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives an energetic and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and it is a merit for Sykes that he can feel that this strange twist will work within the framework of the film. Reach a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
