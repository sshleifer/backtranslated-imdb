I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was quite young, so much of the film becomes blurred when trying to remember it. However, I can say that it was not as much fun as it should have been a movie called Killer Tomato and the most memorable things about this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Apart from that, the film is really just scenes of small tomatoes and big tomatoes that go around and people who act scared and exaggerated as people should do in a movie of this kind. However, the fact of having a very silly premise and a catchy themed song is not a good comedy. Granted that this movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing should be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are fun and do not try to extend a slightly funny premise to a full-fledged movie. Maybe a short would have been fine, since the trailer that showed the elderly couple mentioned above and a man trying desperately to shoot a bigger tomato was pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a fake trailer, but no, in fact they made a full movie, and a rather weak one.
