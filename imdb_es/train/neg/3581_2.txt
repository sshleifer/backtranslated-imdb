I have not been able to decide if this film is so bad that it is good or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, "it is so bad that it has gone from good to bad again". It does not matter, it forced me to look like a lot of strange colored vomits, and it offers a series of scenes that you will not forget, even if you want to. There is a mocking Ray Liotta who tells Pia that his creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray is again, bothering Pia, not with the trophy properly but with a garden hose. Pia has a firm expression and tells her dominant mom that she wants to go to bed with Ray's father, Walter. The actress in the cemetery scene howls the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYYY!" There's that garden hose again, while Walter waves Pia's face and roars, "This is more to your liking !?" There are Pia and her date, so close to the chewing salad that they start to tear off their clothes. Pia is taking a shower but forgetting to take off her dress. Perhaps best of all, it's Pia's typewriter, but instead of the keys are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most (later, I was afraid to open my laptop). And, finally, there's Pia in "The Awards" exposing Hollywood to the well pit she is, spitting out the second best line of all time, "I think I'm not the only one that has had to go to the top". "I see that I've spent more time commenting on" The Lonely Lady "than on much better pictures, so I resign, but bear in mind that once you start watching, you probably can not take your eyes off the screen until you that two hours of your life have disappeared forever.
