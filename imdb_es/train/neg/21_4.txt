What happened to all the Turkish actors? Do not be offended, but I thought it was nothing for all these actors. The movie had no script to prove the skill or ability of the actors. He demanded almost nothing that I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was another failure for him. The script was so bad. There was nothing to sink the teeth and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the script and the direction did not even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the shooting at the beginning of the movie sounded like the noise of paintball guns when firing in a skirmish. It was really weird and they did not sound like real weapons. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a really annoying guy at the beginning of the movie who was a member of the robbery gang. She had this plaintive American voice like a little girl who was shouting phrases like "Let's get the F # $ k out of here" and what are we going to do with the man? "It sounded like a girl, in general, it was fun to see it and it did, I laugh too, for a few seconds, Whoo Hoo, a silent movie, Poor Madsen.
