"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to take place in an immaculate underworld, an era that has already passed, where the biggest sin a child could commit would be to defy the law and get a traffic ticket. It opens with a young car fanatic who gets her archrival's business, which puts her under pressure in a car race. That's it for the drag race - this B film is mainly related to rock 'n roll, man! The people at American International were obviously fond of decent teenagers, who liked to party, and yet did not care about an adult chaperone. There are some fun double meanings and fruit exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would go out and get some fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think you would find him, by his throat?"), But the ghost comes a little late. In short, at 65 minutes, the film tricks us with a car race that takes place off the screen and a "Scooby Doo" style unmasking that makes no sense. However, for lovers of nostalgia, a little fun without meaning. ** since ****
