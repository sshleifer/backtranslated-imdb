OK ..... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Let's go star with the dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie, you can not see the cause of Dino when the body count begins, you can only see the vision of Dino, intelligent enough to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes ahead in the movie, a special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance, the team enters the warehouse and then begins to find body parts and corpses after the din of Dino, after a while a big box arrives. Failing on the computer and you can hear a velociraptor scream, quite spooky! and then a black girl walks forward and now she finds a blooper! A raptor's hand appears and cut off his face, but if you pause when the raptor's hand arrives, can you see that it's just a guy with a hand puppet? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks, some truck, because they wash some weapons there. 2. Where they were wrong, there seems to be ten tons of raptors and a giant T-Rex there! How did the t-Rex fit in there? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a stupid blonde girl told him to capture one of them alive = (4. Santos Jesues, the raptors have wheels in their exploits!) 5. The Dino is now on a ship in the Pacific. Did you know that the T-Rex had something strange in his neck? 7. THE END The film is good if you want to laugh.
