Maybe this is not fair, because I only made it in the middle of the movie. One of the few movies that I really have not been able to see due to a limp. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the work of the camera is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is unrealistic and cheesy. For example, during a coke deal, coke is simply kept loose in a briefcase, I'm not an expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect every time a punch is thrown (it's a "crunchy" upper sound "and they use toy guns with bent sound effects. <br /> <br /> The worst movie of all.
