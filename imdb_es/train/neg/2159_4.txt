Well, it's Robin Hood as a 'geezer' according ... just as they announce! That did not sound very hopeful and, unfortunately, it was worse than he had suspected. <br /> <br /> A female Robin that I can take; a Robin who becomes entangled with the daughter of a dyer to whom I can give credit; but a Robin who exchanges jokes not very funny with his only henchman is harder to swallow, and a Robin and "the complete cast" who seem to have difficulty handling their lines is the kiss of doom. How can someone allow such a laborious delivery to pass without re-recording the scenes? Again and again, Much sounds as if he were struggling with Shakespeare half comprehended instead of letting go with a salty joke; At first, he hoped it was just a failed comedy feature in a character clearly destined for the role of the comedy partner, but then began to spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say about Errol Flynn on paper, he had the ability to offer a high-flying dialogue as naturally as if he had thought about the momentum ... and as this production shows , that is not as easy as it seems. If they were going to choose the characters as if they were cheeky little ones, the actors in question should have been given the appropriate lines: they sound like they have no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I did not even like the sheriff of pantomime, for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but are delivered (and in this case they are written) with a nudge and a nod to the audience. They are out of place well - things that break on the fourth wall - but they really are not that funny. <br /> <br /> This very promised production reminded me of a school work that was limping. The only actor and character I appreciated was Guy of Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have any idea of ​​(a) credible villainy and (b) credible characterization, but frankly, he would not. I did not say that it was a good omen for the future of the series! At the time of writing, I will give you another chance in the hope that things will get better and go to bed a bit next week, since less stage is required for the scene and perhaps the actors feel more comfortable with the dialogue: after Everything, the first episode of "Doctor Who" was not exactly a show, although it was not as bad as this one. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid that the series has almost certainly lost a viewer. <br /> <br /> What would be a shame, because I have a weakness for the "Robin Hood" screen legend, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the solid confidence of Richard Greene. But this Robin does not stir my blood in the least.
