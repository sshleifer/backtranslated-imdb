I vaguely remember Ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the 60s, I was doing several interviews and biographies of dark actors / actresses, among them Ben, the actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961 in The Young Savages Ben was one of the people in a low profile Sci-Fi in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a good conversation with him and his "career" and his life. All these were published in a fanzine of the day, already forgotten long ago. I wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time goes by, and any of those people surely will not remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice guy, who made a living (the contras of those days did not even pay their guests, unless, of course, they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was at most two hundred dollars! Good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking in. How about a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! How ugly, uglier now!
