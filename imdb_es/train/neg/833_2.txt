There really was not much history in this movie. It was based loosely on the events of the first Lion King movie. It's supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> Mix some scenes from the original, and then confirm how this movie changed them a bit. But still, is that it? I expected something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice for the animators. Disney really should stop these direct productions to video. It really was pretty boring and I could have used Jason Statham. "RE-"
