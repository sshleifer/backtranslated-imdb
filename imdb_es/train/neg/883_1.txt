The problems with this movie are many, but I will try to mention the most dazzling and annoying ones. In the first place, although the subject suggests a series of vignettes about life in Manhattan, the reality was that everything, as is usual in movies and television, was something strange, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were fine or non-existent, and practically all the scenes, camera shots, lines of dialogue and emotions expressed were absolutely false. Finally, it came to a point after an hour of desensitizing the garbage I left (something that is not uncommon for me in recent years). I would have guessed that the film was directed by some would-be authors of some third-rate film studies programs. , but I think that the director Mira Nair (at one time, previous to Amelia, talented) participated in this disgusting parody, so perhaps the managerial talent in the United States has descended en masse to the cesspool.
