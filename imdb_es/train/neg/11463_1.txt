This is just an answer for the yahoo that says that this movie is more realistic than the classic, which defines the genre MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, it is known that the brain, the great targets (and other species of sharks, bulls, black tips, oceanic white tips, tigers) populate areas where easy prey are found. Humans do not usually access that menu, however, but it was repeatedly pointed out that the shark in the movie showed abnormal behavior. It is not that it has never happened. The chances of a killer whale destroying almost an entire city, select a human enemy, sink several dozen Atlantic reed fishing boats from the hull and know when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", are sufficiently near the water to do it. To get there, they are so thin as to be laughable. Like this turd of an imitation jaw. Funny. It is also known that large white sharks frequently chew boats, underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, since they resemble seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce (if you do not know, look for it) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like La Orca (hey, that's the name of the flagrant scam we are discussing!), As it would weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not need to. Jaws is amazing (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is bullshit (BLATANT rip-off of Jaws, bad writing, abominable effects, the most ridiculous plot on this side of an Olson Twins movie). It does not take a teacher from Columbia University to see that. See better movies.
