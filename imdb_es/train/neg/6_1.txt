Since the beginning of the film, it seems that the director is trying to portray something, what I want to say is that, instead of the story dictating the style in which the film should be made, he has gone from the opposite way, he had a kind of movement that he wanted to do, and he wrote a story to reconcile it. And he has failed very badly at it. I guess I was trying to make a movie with style. Anyway, I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the means with which he is working, what I try to say is that I have seen worse movies than this one. Here at least the director knows how to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors have also given a decent performance.
