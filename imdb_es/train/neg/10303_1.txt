*** The comments contain spoilers *** I barely clung to this program as a TV show when they started the annoying music in EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was averaging almost one shot per case, when the very nasally Diane Farr was pregnant. (but we did not realize) and when Colby was a TRIPLE agent. But now, in tonight's episode, David is stuck with a crazy, paranoid guy who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and ... CAN NOT DISARM. A trained and experienced field agent who has been the first to pass through the door many times and has experience in hand-to-hand fighting, CAN NOT TAKE A NUT WORK. Not when said nut job blinks, look away, lower your head, close your eyes; not even when you look at the fiber optic cable twisting around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene that let me know that as much as I like to learn from Charles Epps, plump and disheveled, and his sexy / loving friend Amita, my Friday nights will be better if you do not. make. Don gives David the "word of anguish" which is the code for "La s ** t is about to fall"; David is ready, they turn off the lights, they drop the elevator, they startle the work of the nut and ... <br /> <br /> David CAN NOT DISARM / KILL / BEAT IN THE PRESENTATION OF THE WORK OF THE NUT . The bad boy ends up with BOTH ARMS, David ends up shooting. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope the NUMB3RS are fun.
