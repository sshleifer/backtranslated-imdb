This film is exaggerated, predictable, pretentious and hollow at its core. The adjustments are true to the time but are aware of their increase due to prolonged exposure. The persistence on the artifacts stops the action and closes almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking as much as Bruce Willis in the Hart War. Tom, you can not give depth to a character simply by putting your face in white! The content did not guarantee Paul Newman's histrionic acting. This is a fake wrapped in an atomic bomb.
