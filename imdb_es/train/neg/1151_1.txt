This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is the main character, is anything but "motherly". Ok, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Your husband dies. Then he goes to visit his son and finds this piece that is sleeping with his daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the movie is fine. It is not excellent, but it can be observed. The boy is charming and who can blame her? Okay, it is not very maternal to sleep with your daughter's lover, but let's blame that for the loss of her husband. <br /> <br /> She is totally obsessed with the boy. I think this is the part where I started to dislike the movie. She's always there wanting to please him in an "old-fashioned" way with snacks while he's working at his son's house (I think this is the only thing she learned to do), as if it were the only way she could to get it. Attention. Obviously, the boy is not very interested (actually, it seems more like he considers sleeping with her as a charitable activity) and instead of feeling insulted by that, she keeps begging him to go to bed with her and be kind to her . when it becomes very abusive. "I want to please you," she tells him desperately, while he insults her a lot. <br /> <br /> What outraged me in this movie, is the absolute lack of self-esteem that the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a shapeless bulge" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult for women. If it had been me, I would have bought a small object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
