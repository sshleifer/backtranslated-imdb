This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games, Need For Speed ​​is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing in this film that was A-Level was the cars. The performance seemed forced and scripted, the premise was, in the best of cases, fragile, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only saw this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I wish they had shown Eddie Griffin crashing against Enzo somewhere in the movie. In general, do not pay for it, do not go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
