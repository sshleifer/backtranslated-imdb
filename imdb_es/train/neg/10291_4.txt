80 minutes, and it felt twice as long! Brief crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes more or less consist almost entirely of a dialogue (more than a monologue, actually) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously droning about "men", disappointment, sex, aging and his recent break, to a French teenager he met in the ship's cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The tedious monologue continues as they go to the duty-free shop, and to a bar, where finally their self-involved tirade drives them away. The "story" can not end there, of course, so she convinces him to listen to his drone further as he takes him to his cabin. <br /> <br /> How little of romance, sex, or what matters All that this film has, besides bitter criticism, is not enough to justify the price of a rental unless it is one of the lovers of the dramas in which nothing interesting happens. Yes, the ending is very well done, but it is a small reward to submit to what amounts to turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic presenter. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like that. I could be wrong.
