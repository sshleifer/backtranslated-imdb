This is a pretty bad movie. But it's not as bad as its reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not that bad and there is an effective odd scene. And it has a cheezoid plate from the 80s, which means it's always fun. Also be careful with the brief appearance of Jimmy Nail: his attempt at American accent is so amazingly ridiculous that it's fantastic. The breasts of Sybil Danning are also fantastic: they make a brief appearance in the film, but the scene is repeated thousands of times in the final credits in what can only be described as the 12 "remix of Sybil Danning's tits. As a horror movie, it's not scary, the effects are foolish and Christopher Lee shows up sleepwalking through his performance, I guess he was buying a new house and needed some money for the deposit. Central: the man and the woman: they were so insignificant that I forgot almost everything about them and I just saw this movie tonight.The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, oddly enough, they sometimes look alike more to very burned monkeys, the European atmosphere is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, although it is quite terrible, at least gives the film a bit of cheese. /> <br /> In general, good to laugh. It's not good quality, but what did you do? Crafty to expect it to be? And, at least, you always have Sybil door knockers.
