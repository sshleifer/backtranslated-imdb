There is a British edition of this show that is far less extravagant than the American version. The interested person will get a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom, and is wonderfully grateful for what he has. The American version of this program is everything reality television should not be. Instead of making some improvements in a house that the occupants could not pay or do themselves, the whole house is rebuilt. I do not know if this program is trying to show what is a bad welfare system in the US. UU Or if he pleads enough he will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also misplaced. Instead of turning a family into a private area into potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community in general, where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on a house, building something for the whole community ... maybe a place where you can borrow electric and DIY tools along with construction materials so that everyone can benefit if they wish. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community that still lives in the same houses in ruins.
