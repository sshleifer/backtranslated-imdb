Hello people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie really sucks. Think "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing fits well, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is weird in this movie. <br /> <br /> IT IS a total failure. However, as indicated, there are three redemption points on this mutilated potential of a movie. <br /> <br /> A) With a stellar billing of Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of guys who will gracefully submit to see this. Just to have a look at little Hewitt in tight clothes. To tell you now, guys ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's really a little bit attractive for the eyes. The "possibilities" here are diluted. However, I saw everything tempted by the next scene where you know what ... exciting! <br /> <br /> B) The ending is romantic and positive. That is contrary and "on the top" is relevant ... but for me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a kind and friendly guy ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, it is not worth your 10 or more dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of his way, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend. Although I will return it for now ... it depends largely on your next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and your sister is stupid. Her husband is very stupid ... and what the heck, she is very stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. I can not wait for the next Love Actually with JLH!
