Once, a friend asked me to read a script of his that had been chosen by a movie studio. To say that it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I have read would be a daring underestimation. However, I never told him this. Why? Because in a world where films like "While She Was Out" can have a green light and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a script devoid of character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it will not sell. br /> <br /> As many other critics have pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly written Woman-in-Perpiel movie that has abused housewife Basinger, who was hunted by four unlikely hoods in Christma's eve. Every complaint is legitimate, from the weak dialogue and the bad performance to the amazing lapses of logic, but Basinger is a very interesting actress and the premise is not without promises. Here are a couple of things that surprised me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how much we are supposed to think that your husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. Since when did it become child abuse for children to rise up after themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except in Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course the movie is stupid. But so are the countless "thrillers" I've been sitting in, where women are portrayed as pitiful and helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, it seemed refreshing to see a woman get the best out of her tormentors. <br /> <br /> 4) I LOVED the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous critic coined this phrase, I really believe that this film should be renamed "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
