An excellent performance by Alix Elias highlights a poorly directed and confusing dreck stack. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with each pass, I find less and less pleasure. Why is Munchies so lustful? Is that ever explained? Are they a reflection of our selfish and rude 'animal'? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not repeat a touch of subtlety that plagues this film and make the connection explicit? Another part of this movie that does not bother me at all: motorcycles. The jacket that the little monster carries on the cover seems to suggest a 'street' traveler. The sunglasses say "great uncle". With all this I am ready for Easy Rider to comply with the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series if you're a fan of reptile puppets, tiny, smart cracking, it will give you the treatment you deserve.
