Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. He looked over "who is who" in the land of terror that is in the movie ... well, my friend rented it, brought it and we started to see it. It's supposed to be a comedy ... I did not smile even once, until the 40 minute mark. <br /> <br /> Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are movies out there that cost absolutely nothing, and they are amazing (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I could not help noticing the similarities (ie, STEALING) with a low-budget independent film titled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", I read my critique (DESTROY this movie by the way). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... had the potential it really had. He had the "power of the star", the stolen plot (allows to film the scenes behind the scenes of the making of a film ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, this irritates me more and more I think about), ... it really could have been fun. A LOT, MANY JOYS ARE NOT GOOD. The acting is fine for what it is. But it went on, it was not funny, and the plot was totally stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this one a two, because it was not SO INCREDIBLE, but that is the ONLY reason.
