Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic in the family whose life is crumbling around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything better. Ahh ... if everything in life was that easy. The fact that this "movie" looks like it was made with about $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
