It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a big hype that proved to be a box office failure. London Dreams is no exception to that. Let's analyze it ... It's about pursuing your dreams and how far you'll go to achieve it. It sounds awesome right? But, unfortunately, the movie is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to succeed in the future. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of an audience of 90,000 people who shout his name. He is accompanied by two brothers, Zoheb and Wasim (the debutants Aditya Roy and Ranvijay) and a dazzling Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams", their dream band. After impressing the head of a record company, they become sensations overnight. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, who does not want to reveal until he achieves his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla, also known as Mannu (Salman Khan), a flirtatious and carefree boy who has no ambitions in life, to join his band. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent by which, later, Arjun feels envious of Mannu's superior abilities and his relationship with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to ruin Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects, we only feel the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Shah, whom we have admired in Namaste, London. I felt that I simply visualized the script. In short, a glorified cameraman. Suresh Nair's script dulls even though it has its moments. Defined in a predictable way, the script bores you. The camera work was impressive in capturing the beauty of London. It is the only entertaining part while watching songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are humble, while others are passable and noisy. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and bothers you. Asin is forgettable and I do not think it will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is awesome, while Ranvijay is strictly fine. It provides as the bitch is what we have seen in countless movies. Ompuri is ongoing with the procedures. I do not want to leave aside the faults, since it will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me say it in a simple and direct way, London Dreams is a soulless film that you can enjoy on DVD.
