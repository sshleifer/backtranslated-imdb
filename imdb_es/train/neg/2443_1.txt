This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies in history. It's so bad that I found it quite nice. The performance, oh my God, the script, you have to be kidding. How can you imagine the writer creating things like: a boy who makes fireworks at school, fireworks SO powerful, that when someone is hit by him, he flies a hundred yards back and explodes? -A girl is trapped in the cell phone, the murderer is trying to open the door. She gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. First he makes an extension cord, oh the horror, and then, when it's done, he punches the door and the murderer's head. WOW - and there are many more examples like that. oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, it used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
