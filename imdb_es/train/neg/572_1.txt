Ugh, what can I say no, ugh. I rented this movie because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires. This movie could not have been slower. Lack not only in the plot, but the performance is atrocious. Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this film very difficult to see. Many times I questioned my own sanity by continuing to watch the movie long after the plot had jumped the shark. Here is a sample of the most relaxed aspects ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The professional "killer" insists on sleeping outdoors only at night . He wakes up with a woman crying, sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere. He will immediately comfort her without questioning his sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results ... One of the main characters is Zoe, she was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these pills "she arrived in Mexico City, she's fine, although his body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /> <br /> Guard outside the monastery where the hero is staying, the night is killed by vampires, the hero leaves the next day, then returns one day then, just to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after it left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
