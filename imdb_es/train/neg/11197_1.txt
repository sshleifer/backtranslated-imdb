What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I propose that it was this awful little movie from the beginning of the year. Badly written, poorly edited, and (if I can be so bold) badly acted, "The Order" is the black hole of the film, a film so dense that not even the slightest entertainment could escape its horizon of sucking events. It's not even accidentally funny, like (for example) "Showgirls." <br /> <br /> You know that the producers assume that their audience is not going to be very intelligent. They changed the name of the film, originally titled "The Sin Eaters", because they thought that Americans were too stupid to understand what a devourer of sins was, even though they do everything possible to explain what sinners eat in the film. Instead, they believe that a totally generic title and a grim-looking image of Heath Ledger are more than enough for you to get there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they were right? My ex-girlfriend saw Heath's picture and dragged me. Congratulations, producers, have reached your target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk of a specific order (you guessed it) who is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor He has problems with celibacy, possibly because nobody in his health Judgment would believe that he knew the least about religion, let alone be a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny fat alcoholic. As much as I wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen, his humorous attempts reminded me of all the fools in my high school who did Monty Python imitations, thinking that if they only said lines like pythons they would do it automatically it would be funny. You know what kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say more, I would be in danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, what ruined this movie for me was the fact that it was created.
