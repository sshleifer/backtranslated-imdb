The Angry Red Planet (Quick Review) <br /> <br /> Like "Planet X Man", this is a strange science fiction story drawn from an era in which fantasy and science fiction were still almost at the same level. That is, we have some highly laughable special effects and a rampant pseudoscience that passes itself off as science fiction. And yes, it is another "classic" released in a high quality transfer with a clear image and clear sound, by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to see this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time that our space team is on Mars. (What, did you think "Angry Red Planet" was referring to Neptune?) Before that, there is a fairly deficient quality space crew that boards a spaceship, inside which they smoke and launch macho chauvinistic jokes directed at the "woman" feminine. " the gang. It would be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it were not so fun. But Mars is the real reason we're seeing this. The film is usually black and white, but Mars, well, Mars is screaming blood red. It is filmed in this strange red plastic sheen that gives the angry red planet an interesting appearance of overexposed redness. It is really quite a spectacle, as are the spectators (ha ha) that the spectators must witness. The best thing is the "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think it's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing that combines traits of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It stretches along all the puppets and scares the shit out of our "heroic team". There are other strange aliens, and badly imagined, to be seen, but that takes the cake. Finally, after their heartbreaking experience on Mars, the sexist team approaches their "ship" and returns to the planet from where it came. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Sci-fi cinema fans and curiosity seekers, and some general moviegoers. The fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with it (if they did not get it in the program). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Score of nostalgia, 4/10 in total. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
