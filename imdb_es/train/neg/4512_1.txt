After having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining what it is to be a Geisha. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture closer to the wide Western audience and help to demystify the country where Zen originated, Samurai, the Geisha of the Kyoto world. Some of the most moving moments of the film are the Americans who show up in Japanese environments. Geisha's dances were not authentic. There was too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: the proper use of incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. Sakura's scenes were almost obscenely kitsch! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
