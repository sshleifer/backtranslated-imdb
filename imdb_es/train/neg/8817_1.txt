No, I have never seen any of the "Santa Slasher" series, that is, 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', the original 'Black Christmas' or this, 'Christmas Evil'. I've heard all about your reputation, or MADS (Mothers vs. the Altered Saints). I thought I was going to rent this one since I've heard it as a reference in the 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment. <Br /> <br /> Mothers should be against this, but not for Santa's "killer" ooooohhhh, but for the fact that this movie was just bullshit. Bored, long ?? even at 92 minutes, garbage. <br /> <br /> The little boy sees Santa Claus arrive by a chimney in 1947, deliver presents, eat some goodies and, miraculously, float down the chimney. The boy lies down to the bed, but returns to the living room to witness Mommy and Santa (more or less) getting going. Apparently, this ruined that child for the rest of his life, although the scene was as hot as when Ralphie's father got the "Leg Lamp" in "A Christmas Story." He was so disturbed, he went to the attic and, well, he cut off his hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and the messy kid works in a toy factory. We know that it is a little off center, and stalks both children and parents. Who is bad, who is good, blah, blah. Do you need two-thirds of the film to finally adjust? as if that was not presaged from the first painting. NO MOVIE should take so long. <br /> <br /> I must admit that this movie increased his tension, but only because he was still waiting for him to do something, anything to anyone. When it finally does, well, punish "who is bad", it's as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I have not mentioned the end of WTF. I'm thinking it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is upset because his brother is killing, and his solution is killing.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve or Evil. Once again, I did not see the other "Santa-Slashers" , but this one sucked badly. He accumulated suspense due to the nature of the film and never delivered a decent gift.
