I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a porn category C movie with a big difference: there is no porn. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue need a complete overhaul. Maybe then the bad performance would not have been so remarkable. At a minimum, the pace should have been accelerated. <br /> <br /> Although I accept that I had a low budget and that the director did a good job visually given the few resources I had, I should have spent more time in the story or better yet, have someone else write it down. Many of the action scenes did not make sense. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
