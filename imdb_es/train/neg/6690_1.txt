I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. Honestly, I could not distinguish what genre this movie was when I saw it, and if it was a comedy, I missed the humor. The plot was nonexistent and the performance was horrible. My friends and I could see approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we turned it off and asked the video store to return it. I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless I try to watch the worst movies of all time. Honestly, I do not know how this film lasted more than a day in theaters and, besides, I can not understand why anyone would want to see it, considering that it is not only an uninteresting title, but also the lack of famous actors / actresses. This review is not a joke and, honestly, I think this could be the worst movie ever made. It is without doubt the worst movie I have had to watch.
