I saw "Rachel's Attic", thinking it would give me a nice visceral ride. However, it was not the case. Visceral, yes, but nice? That would be a big fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave him a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (albeit briefly) as one of the reprehensible characters in the film. How Mr. Hansen was once attracted to this work, I will never know. The idea of ​​history is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the performance is mediocre. The only thing that is worse than that, are the special effects. YIKES !!! I have seen better effects in a primary school game. Surrender, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I heard you're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few Inde films, well done, that come out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
