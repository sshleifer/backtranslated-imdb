George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. She is supposedly the heiress of a fortune of facial cream. He interviewed her on his yacht. They fall in love in bathing suits. <br /> <br /> It turns out (quite early) that she is not an heiress. She is part of an advertising campaign for cold cream. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast does little to cheer him up. Davis and Brent carry the photo. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite entertaining. It is far from its best moment. But, especially considering its darkness in his work, it is not one of his worst things either.
