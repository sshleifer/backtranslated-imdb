I can not believe the positive reviews of this film: I thought it was one of the worst, the most badly executed and the bad performances I've seen in my life. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). Does she begin to kiss him while he is tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it was not even bad in a good and ridiculous way. Simply terrible, I could not understand why they bothered to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly, very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit man. Id, I could continue. Again, I have been surprised by the positive comments. The only thing that kept me from seeing it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end did not disappoint in his stupidity either! "live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
