- = contains a spoiler of the original and film versions = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Notre Dame de Paris musical, I also read a book this summer and saw a movie today, at the beginning I had many hopes to see a good movie, especially when I saw the 6.3 IMDb Point. The first scenes were good, but I really waited, the scene of the theaters directly from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kisses the gringos, I felt something is wrong ... not even a kiss in the book, even in the musical ... <br /> <br /> and there was a big gap for which Esmeralda was judged by a sorcerer. In the book, she teaches her goat how to respond to clock numbers or write the word "phoebus". He hopes there was a phoebus, right? in this film he is a bit of soldier scrap, nothing more, the creators made Quasimodo's love show up and even canceled Frollo's love ... but Notre Dame was frollo. his thoughts, his struggles between love for God and love for humans in the movie, we can not find any of that, all we have is a villain who is really bad and kills people whose confrontations with his thoughts ... and not to mention the phoebus, not to mention the love for frollo, not to mention jehan (brother of frollo) without mentioning Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's fine, the story would have cut a lot) did not even mention the real story ... ( another PS: frollo was not an opus dei or some cult member who really is interested in alchemy, tries to make gold ... was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> finally does not see this movie , is a kind of director's edition for a true masterpiece, and if you've seen it before reading the book, God, have mercy on you ... you should read the book immediately. <br /> <br /> this movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II the animated film, spend your time with seeing the musical of Notre Dame De Paris .. said enough ..
