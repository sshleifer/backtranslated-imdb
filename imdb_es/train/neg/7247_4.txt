In short: this is a romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something else. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. He wants to be profound and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which gives you the feeling of an important movie. Dialogue is intelligent - sometimes. There are some moments of "laughing out loud". <br /> <br /> But this is what prevents, in the end, from being something more than a nocturnal formulator, in flight, that kills time: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer: How many times can Joe's sad-looking puppy dog ​​stare into space with his jaw open before he starts to get upset? Maybe a little slobber would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow: she is really flat here and not just in the chest. It is assumed that her role is this cheerful, friendly and affectionate girl who just keeps getting into wrong situations, as a result she is very confused, and that is why a sad sack loser like Schwimmer has a chance with her. But Gwenneth plays it very boring. Combine this with the drooling face of a puppy dog ​​(above) and you have very little chemistry to look after. <br /> <br /> (I kept imagining someone else in this role, for example, Kate Hudson). <Br /> <br /> 3. The script and the plot: what happens, basically, does not sound true; all the problems are wrapped in the end with a loop so clean and tidy that it looks like a whistle and the writers say "Oops, it's time to wrap it, you have a train to catch!" So they took out the Hollywood formula book, they checked all the boxes and they went home.
