-It may contain spoilers ... but believe me, this movie is spoiled from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I entered this movie with great expectations. It was my fault. He had put too many shares in Steve Carell's record to date. Virgin of 40 years ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The office. And I also made the mistake of going to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. It has always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely wrong lately. The last time I felt embarrassed and in such pain in a movie theater was seeing "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This movie was lost from start to finish. The script was volatile material. Horrible to write everywhere "Killer of love"? "Love is a skill"? Whoever wrote this shit suffered the same affliction that hit the writer (s) of American Beauty ... trying too hard to waaaaayyyyyyy. The whole movie was peppered with Three's Company moments, like the horrible and artificial shower scene. Or the senseless / confused aerobic scene. Or the horrible laundry scene. Just when you think something serious and / or real is about to happen, you throw yourself into one of these terrible moments. And it happens again and again and again. <br /> <br /> And what about the character of Carell? Does the boy find a little money in a bookstore and suddenly he is in love? Let's be honest. His conversation stunk. Both should have fired after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you are unlucky enough to see this movie ... The character of Carell is trying to say something that is absolutely random and not funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a child" ... that's all, seriously), but they both laugh so hard that the coffee is about to come out through the nose. The actors themselves seemed to be suffering, wondering why they are being directed to do what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Back to the IMDb ... you need to find a way to keep the promotional equipment of a movie out of this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious that the first 20 ratings were published by 12-year-olds or by Flunky's recruiting for the study. Check out The Family Stone's rating ... if that's an average level of 5, then it absolutely has to be a 2 ... and that's pushing it.
