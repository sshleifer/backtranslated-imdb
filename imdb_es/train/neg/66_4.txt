I guess this movie attracted me as much for the sound of the story as for the main actor, so I gave it a shot, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is established by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), is forced to run to form a gang and go against them to clean their own names and those of his family. That's all I can say about the story, since I was not paying the utmost attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Agent Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate, Kelly Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a very good performance, for what it's worth, and the movie has its flashy moments, especially with a gun battle towards the end, but I can not say that I enjoyed it since I did not see it all. . Good!
