This movie was a stupid piece of shit. All wrong Why is it that we who love Western films abandon us nine times out of ten when we rent Westerns? It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it's not worth playing. For the most part, the main action of Shiloh Falls took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were models from the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad: in one scene, the marshal threw his six shots about nine times and did not He could hit any of the three big men who were about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this madness. Perhaps those who participated in this film could have taken some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
