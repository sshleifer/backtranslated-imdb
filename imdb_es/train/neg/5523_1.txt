Georgia Rule has to be one of, if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that made me gasp, "what?" Aloud at least 7-10 times throughout your exhausting two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Announced in his trailer as a film about three generations of women: Jane Fonda as matriarch, Felicity Huffman as his daughter and Lindsay Lohan, as the rebellious, exaggerated granddaughter of sex and barely dressed, the viewer believes that this will be a clich√©, a light and light film about growing up and joining as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about fake Ads in the worst case. <br /> <br /> After many shots of animals doing "fun" things in the background of "fundamental" scenes and not to mention the entire five minutes focused on an old woman who enters a doctor's office. weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her own film genre: unsupported inappropriate comedy, horribly acted that deals with extremely serious topics In the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, then he should have seen The Royal Tenenbaums. Oblique. Junebug And so. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrible gender Georgia Rule is about is to create a hypothetical situation. Suppose the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character who was celibate because he was sexually abused as a child. But instead of the film taking a more dramatic turn, there would be laughter and comedy, with all the reactions of the characters as false, lifeless, human beings who pretend to worry. <br /> <br /> Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, least dimensional character that could have been completely removed from this poorly written script, along with a male character that pulls all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a spoiled and overly tanned girl who does not share any of the same interests as him, as well as an unnecessary scene of car chases, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you have Georgia Regla. <br /> <br /> I found that this movie is an insult to any of those people who are outside of the filmmakers, writers, actors, editors, etc., who have many more talents and are not getting noticed. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if necessary, get drunk enough in advance.
