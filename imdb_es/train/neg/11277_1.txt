There is no doubt that this movie has an impressive cast, but unfortunately this does not help with the main disadvantages of the film. I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents that are not their own when it is obvious to all who can not convince. Fiennes simply can not do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the acting, the character will never be convincing. As the main problem ... the plot ... was there one? I guess there was some kind of story involved but it was so full of holes that I could not wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
