Well, let me start by saying that none of this will be a surprise to anyone who has read the other comments. That said, MY G-D, THIS FILM REPROVED! I mean, WOW, I did not know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did in something and they still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie. Corman probably released this movie at some point, but he refused because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason why this movie was made in the first place is that someone said: 'Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get that contains zombies? Resident Evil? No, someone else came first. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared. Hey, did not Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're out of the platform business, we could get it for a few cents! "<br /> <br /> Basically, they did everything possible to make a movie that looked like the game, even to shoot the match as if it were the game, the characters were actually playing the game. <br /> < The first and main problem is that the original game was horrible, I mean, bad movie-merchandising-made-in-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and- then-shippe d-out-and-buy-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-horrible Christmas.The graphics were boring.The monsters were boring.The levels were boring.The interface was boring.The case was boring In other words, this was a boring game, and that was the ARCADE version.The homemade version was even worse! With the homemade version, you did not even get the shotgun in your hands while you were bored like a fool for this game without But I'm digressing. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they went so far as to intersperse scenes from the real game during the s fight scenes. HUH ??? Did not the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was a real fight? Not to mention that EVERY fight was filmed from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player comes from the character's point of view). Maybe that's why they put the graphics of the game, to let you know that they were referring to the game ... Of course, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that made ALL this ENTRETRE experience was very nice was the fact that everyone in the theater was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general disbelief were taken as a commonplace and they did not throw me out of here. <br /> <br /> To summarize above, do not go see this movie! Do not even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
