A friend and I went through a phase a few (many) years ago of selecting the most unpleasant horror movies in the video store for one night's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap soundtrack of the synthesizer is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Among them is a scene in which a man is attacked and defends himself with a series of unlikely objects, he made me laugh at that moment (it does not seem so funny in retrospect, but that's it). <br /> <br /> Apart from that it's total shit, look. But it's probably worth watching if you like movies like "Chopping Mall." Yes, I have also seen it.
