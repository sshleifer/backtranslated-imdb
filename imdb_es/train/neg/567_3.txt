This movie is one of the most horrible movies that have ever been made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer, not an actor, what? Are you killing vampires with your guitar? And what about the terrible plot? Oh my God, this movie really sucks. At the end is the vampire queen played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" hunters arrive there are only 4 vampires left! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run in the sun ??? And what of the "Great Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head with a shotgun? That is really a "NO". In "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, does not a single vampire die with A SHOTGUN? This really is a lack of originality!
