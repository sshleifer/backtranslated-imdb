My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies that nobody has ever heard of. It is true that, at times, it has led to some fun discoveries. Many times, the best that can be said is that they definitely run an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home "Advice From A Caterpillar". I was excited because the box said it was funny. Luckily for us, the propaganda in the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where, unless you are a pretentious and superficial person who likes to watch movies about you, you will hate all the characters in the movie. Until the introduction of the only sympathetic character. With which the main and pretentious annoying character will fall in love and act in such a way that, in the real world, it would scare away anyone. <br /> <br /> SPEAK TO THE ROLE OF THE POWER OF HERE <br /> <br /> So a handful of pretentious, emotionally insipid, twisted artists, dismiss love and find success in their careers. Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect boy). Then we see the woman, the annoying and pretentious artist (about 30 years old?) Go crazy while falling in love. So he tries to run away from the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom he has had excellent but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to chase him away. In the real world, she would have been quite successful. I certainly wanted to run away from her and I was not even in a relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Although it is good that man "fought for his love", I never wanted her to have it. (Nor my girlfriend) She did not deserve it. And, why do I wonder if the director thought that the "almost perfect man" should be punished for having to win a relationship with her? When the artist asked the 'almost perfect guy' to leave, we also shouted for him to leave. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want it to fail. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, let me tell you that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times. although his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. As for the other characters, they were well interpreted, morally bankrupt and annoying. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laughed a couple of times in the movie. Unfortunately, there was not much laughter until the last 10 minutes or so. But by the time I had those laughs, I had been praying for the movie to end for too long. I needed to get these vicious characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the people you hate fight with a love for the people they do not deserve, then this is the movie for you.
