Filmfour will have to do much better than this little snot of a movie if they want to get the right reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Glasgow (although it is only a film). A couple of secondary characters have something that approaches a Scottish accent). The premise, about people who live in nothing, they do not go anywhere, they all meet in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning, since they have night jobs, they COULD have made a really fun cult movie, insightful, quirky. Instead of that, we have a group of saddos obsessed with ourselves and a plot that has been made into pieces, I am surprised that it has not been forbidden. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. And sleeps with Z too. Oh, you've solved it. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time. Painful dialogue: it sounded like something a group of 16-year-olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous, only written as a feminine token with the hope that women would be fooled into seeing it. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of nut who laughs at beer ads and can usually find you wandering in packages screaming on Saturday nights in bland urban centers, then you'll love this movie and you will find her as "a right fox". Everyone else, run, do not get away from this pitiful little misfit. <br /> <br /> And one question, when the group left the "boring" coastal city (Saltcoats despite changing the name in the film), to return to Glasgow, WHY they did it through the services of the Forton Highway in LANCASTER which is in England?
