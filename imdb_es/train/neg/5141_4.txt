1914 was an incredible year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he appeared in more than 30 movies! While most of these films were not particularly good, they did give him the opportunity to evolve slowly in his screen character. However, in this film, the familiar character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Of course Charlie looked like the role, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other unpleasant things to people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> As for this very small movie, it's interesting to watch the cast. Although they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that, although it has some nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Mabel came to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions: it must have been located near a racetrack). Charlie and Mack appear and slip away. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie hits Chester and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away, leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, oddly enough, did not seem discouraged by Charlie's rude behavior). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of silent comedy or a film historian, this is a very forgettable movie that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors really do on stage, although not unusual for a Keystone movie, is not particularly fun when seen today.
