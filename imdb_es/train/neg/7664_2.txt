Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a review of a movie composed entirely of questions? Could this be? Why an ancient civilization buried artifacts around the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text tracking inconsistent? Why would a nun (for sure it seemed nice) deliver 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine pits come out in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does the character of Tara Reid suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment to have sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would not even an archaeologist open a solid gold chest, obviously valuable, with a hammer? Why modern computers continue to show the contours of green objects of the pre-Tron era, with small "bleeps"? And all the timers of explosive films must have digital screens? Why does NOTHING in this movie make sense?
