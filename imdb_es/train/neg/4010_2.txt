When I first saw the program, the first episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotyped "mysterious" vampire and Sookie introduced himself as an independent woman. However, the show descended from here and the characters that were once interesting are as entertaining as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting skills. For episode 5, Bill's eyebrows are so low that his face only consists of a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she only reacts to how nice it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters go to bed too early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and that I could play with a little more easily. As soon as Sookie loses it, he struts like a total ditz, just thinking about Bill's libido and the size of his appendix. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just goes silly. His actions are never really explained, except that he does it for Sookie. Why? Their mutual love never deepens, if there is love. So far, it seems that sex is the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually of the same sex, but let's go. Every five seconds I see a kind of buzzing. It was not a big surprise, since HBO always tries to move from a soft-core pornography to a decent television show. Bill coming out of the ground and getting on with Sookie for no reason, what is that? I laughed so hard it almost became mine. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into details about anything. All the events that happen usually remain unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like are the minor characters. Tara and her drunken mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason why I keep watching the program is for the development of the secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Less sex and the main characters of the show would be worth much more.
