I had to see this at school. And to summarize ... <br /> <br /> Actors without talent, scripts without talent and a director without talent. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Do not even watch the movie. Do not bother. You'll be so disappointed. My teacher said that it was supposed to be good. How wrong I was. He even fell asleep a little. The actors in the movie were just bad. The best actor there was the old man and that does not say much. It has a horrible plot with horrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it did not make sense. The script was impassive and confusing. There were points in the movie when I frowned and said, "What?" There were also too many loose ties and holes in the plot. It was absolutely horrible.
