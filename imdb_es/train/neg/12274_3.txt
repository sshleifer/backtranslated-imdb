Normally I am not someone who says that a movie is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only positive aspect of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, who looks quite attractive, and the fact that this movie is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is incredibly boring and does not get anywhere in the movie. None of the characters is even remotely interesting and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why the hell Sean Connery agreed to make this movie, but he definitely should have gone through this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could watch this movie is if you are a die. -hard Sean Connery fan and he just wants to see everything he's done. However, save it for the end. <br /> <br /> Well, if by some miracle you end up seeing this despite my criticism (or any of the other reviews on this site), I hope you enjoy it more than me. did. Thank you for reading.
