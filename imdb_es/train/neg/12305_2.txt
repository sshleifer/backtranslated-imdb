I'm watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel the TV went on when I turned it on. It is a not very credible and rather boring story about the wife of a minister (Alexandra Paul) in love with a young stallion / drifter (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey takes off his shirt and Alexandra faints. I get the feeling that he's not supposed to do anything good, and that's why he's messing with skinny Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because, as I said, he takes off his shirt a lot and I just saw the back of his neckline. There's a lot of sax in the soundtrack, which is just painful.
