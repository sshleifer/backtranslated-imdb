How many times do we have to watch bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream-ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is a bit original, but the film itself is a complete failure. On the one hand, the dialogue is badly developed, it is boring and it wastes a lot of time in trivial details, the performance is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk.
