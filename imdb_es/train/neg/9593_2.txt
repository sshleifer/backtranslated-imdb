Judging by some of the comments on IMDB, I expected an action movie, perhaps dramatic, stupid, simple or comical, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is. I saw it, it certainly did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and direct (although the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). It takes three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of murderers. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then simply let one of the murderers, the princess, become a rogue on a journey of revenge. Add a rebellious love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not managed to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some strange images that try to be science fiction with a low budget, what you have left is a feeling of emptiness. The movie does not look like a movie, but it's a strange dream, incoherent and boring. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
