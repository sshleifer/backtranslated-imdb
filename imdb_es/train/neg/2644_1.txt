The Sentinel represents everything related to the lack of Hollywood soul and the sad lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I can not think of anything good, everything is so generic, so done in the factory and so lazy, that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting and unworthy public. <br /> <br /> A plot about a Secret Service Agent who plans to kill Prez could well be entertaining. If it is managed by a good director or a comprehensive cast that is. Douglas is the one that is framed. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom she is having an adventure (a plot project not developed and unresolved). Sutherland is the best friend who thinks he's guilty because there would not be a movie if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a Maybelline fortune and ... that's all. I guess there are fewer requirements for women entering the Secret Service. As usual in a movie like this, the role of the Prez in itself is just a tool, a tab and is very poorly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us the SWAT just as pathetic again in 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland seem incredibly bored and they call their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the woman most exposed to the 21st century, basically is in this just to attract the audience of Desperate Housewives. His role is 100% useless and does absolutely nothing to improve the plot or to add to the development of the character. It just has 2 lines to rub together. A truly shameless marketing tactic. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment, then do not let me stop you. But it is time and money that you will not return.
