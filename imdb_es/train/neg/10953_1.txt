This excuse for television is the most terrible garbage that has hit Australian television. The housemates are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are chosen on the basis that you are likely to try to kill them if you were to live with them. As far as I'm concerned, Big Brother is the decline of Western society, which shows how we, as a society, are on a steep slope to become brain-dead idiots. What happened to television that did not address the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can take your soul away. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and, once he moved to Channel 10, became terribly unflattering. With the exception of The Simpsons, who is highly intelligent.
