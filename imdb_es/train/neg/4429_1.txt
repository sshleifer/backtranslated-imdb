What a piece of stupid gut. <br /> <br /> I will not even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth the time. The only comment I will make is: why make DUMB an inarticulate imbecile to be the star?!? <br /> <br /> There are not many more grim testimonies about the deterioration of the mental condition of networks that the FOX fact has stated that it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series), but it will bring back People like Joe Millionaire for a new round of killing the brain cells of the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX has lost it, in my humble opinion.
