I have rarely witnessed such a waste of talent so gratuitous. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this desperate swamp of a movie. The few interesting lines that the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than false leads. The actors of the stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles that go nowhere; a director of occasional geniuses produces a film that seems filmed through a camera lens stained with coffee; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of unmotivated incoherence. The film has a cheap and lustful feel, but hardly at the level of comments, it is really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I go to the IMDb to write balanced comments, generally appreciative. This atrocious disaster of a movie only makes me want to produce an endless and bilious tirade. I will not, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this garbage.
