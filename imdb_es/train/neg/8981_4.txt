This version of Paramount / OKLAHOMA scam! / ANNIE RECEIVES HIS PISTOL / CALAMITY JANE is not so unusual or innovative. The marketing and introduction comments can be there to save what is really a very bad movie from a western music movie in a sound studio and as a live television show. I do not find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in several scenes with yellow, pink or red, or ... all that innovative. As I said, it seems more like a movie that was produced with a television budget: All the sound, with a minimum of scenes supported by the illuminated cycles! (Compared to NEW FACES (FROM 1952).) However, the actors behave reasonably well, and this style was much better understood when the shot by Paramount LI'L ABNER in 1959. Widely, this movie suggests the question that it is repeated often: Are you thinking?
