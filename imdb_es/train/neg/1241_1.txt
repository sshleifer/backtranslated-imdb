This is the worst movie I've seen in years! The ridicule begins and continues in the same way. I realize when something will happen in this movie and the acting is worse. The end lifts it a little and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. I'm sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but this sucks.
