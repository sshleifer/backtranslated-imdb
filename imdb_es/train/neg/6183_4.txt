In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as president of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. Now, in 2009, the United States has another president, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it's the same as saying: " get your fingers. " Cutting is better than cutting your head off. "This sequel is a really bad movie that kept me incredibly bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2: The Reef is made up of actors from television series who completely lack credibility and Dramatic, weighty, but they're perfect to show off their bodies Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow performances and I liked some of the previous films by Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil I and especially Ted's Excellent Adventure) but in this film, he can not generate the minimum level of tension, emotion or entertainment. They are misunderstood, they are also repulsive, Honestly, I wanted them all ... To die ... The cinematography of this film is also scarce and seems to have been made by an technical team that makes promotional videos for hotels in Hawaii. In the the Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, but that's the same as nothing, as I said before. Avoid this fucking movie at all costs.
