"Bullfighter" was made in 2000, but it was released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: the confusing plot, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez and the annoying edition? It has to be I think the plot was that Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) made a mystical road trip. They meet many crazy characters and also avoid some evil ones. The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when they try to be subtle, do not draw attention to themselves with unproven frame developments and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe will be there for 2 minutes at the most.
