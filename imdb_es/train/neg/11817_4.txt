A fairly average science fiction movie. The plot was more or less evident from the beginning. Although the performance was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliché, using ideas taken from numerous films. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter and crash into the red dwarf who has been orbiting. On board they find a stasis pod, which coincidentally works wrong at that time. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the capsule waking up, you realize that he is a complete lunatic. Something that totally escapes the crew of 3 people from the research ship ... <br /> <br /> After that, it becomes a scam in all the other films that involve a psychotic madman who terrorizes victims innocents, in general I think Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I do not consider a good movie either. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, take out Aliens and look at that again. <br /> <br />
