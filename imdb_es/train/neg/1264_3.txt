This movie does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a funny movie because seeing had a nice premise of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film and, instead, presents a totally boring story that, moreover, is not very original nor is it written with intelligence. It's a pity that he tried to be so different from his predecessor, because otherwise, this could have been a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Like "Robot Jox", this is a B movie but with such a big difference that it just is not a very good one. Perhaps this also has to do with the fact that "Robot Jox" was created during the 80s, when the B movies still had some charm and class, although the film premiered in 1990. This really can not be said about this movie. It's just lame, poorly done, poor looking and not exciting enough. It also has an ending that leaves you thinking 'Is this? That is all? ' <br /> <br /> Actually, what the story of the film lacks is good. Maybe a good main villain would have been a good idea and some other things, like a real story point, some action or nice main characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what were you thinking about when you chose the actors? for this movie All of them are simply not nice in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is the main character, who behaves as if it were the gift of God for the woman and Mr. Perfecto, who can compete with anyone. Could not they just get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic film, with the concept of having big battle droids, this movie surely lacks action. If they had put a little more action in the movie, the movie would at least have been more entertaining to watch. Instead, we now have a movie that fails to impress in virtually every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> You can see better an episode of "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers", for more action and sympathy. 3/10
