After 30 seconds, you realize that there was no real budget for this cheap imitation. The story is taken from great movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like that kind of movies, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to see: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is corny and the music is stupid and totally out of place. You do not care at all what happens with the characters. The so-called bad are not interesting at all and are quite stereotyped. So, what about blood and blood? Well, there are some, although it is quite cheap and the action runs very badly. 2 points, only for the gore and the blood, but I understand that this is not worth even for the gore-hounds.
