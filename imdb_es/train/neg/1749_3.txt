I must say that this was the worst priyadarshan movie (released along with a much better kyonki that was also his directorial adventure), it does not contain a specific story and only focuses on bodily exhibitions of debutant actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think Priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy films just like Govinda and David Dhavan had done in the past having given some good artists who also lost their audience. So it will be good for him to concentrate more on the script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of the Herapheri and Malamal weeklies instead of giving us fakes like Garam Masala!
