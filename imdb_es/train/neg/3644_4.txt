This movie is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Also, filming the film as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more credible, you can not leave it so easily, Mr. Dir. However, do not let my comments fool you, as I would recommend that you watch this movie, as it throws something of light on psychology or nonexistent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the movie is absolutely garbage! There is no other way to say it! It is pure and simply fails to capture any sense of the atmosphere! What happens does not translate into feelings of despair, panic, fear or fear that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. No, instead, it leaves you with your mouth open "Is that all?" spilling from your tongue, and you are in no way obsessed by these actions of children. Rather, you simply feel embarrassed by another movie that started with potential, but ended up falling flat on the most crucial point. Day zero, indeed ... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
