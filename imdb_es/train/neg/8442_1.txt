GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / The Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> The mousetrap Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who discovers that her husband (Fedja van Huet) cheats on her, but she does not. Do not you dare to face it. She painfully avoids any confrontation with humans, her parents and her sister, so we have a main character in a movie that does not do much. We hardly know anything about his background or his motivations. Only a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not only during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we also in the audience have to suffer? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up at the movies after seeing this invincible mess. It was about 90 minutes very boring and painful. I usually try to avoid spending energy on making bad movies. I will take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case there is a fair warning. How the hell did you get Nanouk Leopold funding (largely from publicly funded funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to talk about. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematic ideas or a cast with a little more appeal. None at all, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view." The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective of life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is not an interesting picture in the whole movie. I can not think of a cast that could have given life to this, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this great lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we filmed you for three minutes, it just expresses sadness." A perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and look at this late at night, guaranteed that it will also let you sleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
