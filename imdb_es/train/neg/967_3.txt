In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a "horror movie for thinking men". Wow, you could say, register me. This thing is a disaster. Presents a young actress who has a range of 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British accent (dubbed), and a story without chills, emotions or spills. <br /> <br /> It's not even interesting psycho-babbling. One will only laugh at its cheap effects and crave a sample of Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story involves a girl with a glandular fever who runs away in her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, an art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after the two hour point saying ... where did my two hours go? <br /> <br /> The direction has no inspiration and I wish it could be pretentious ... something interesting ... it seems that the producers were in lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the world of dreams things are boring. <br /> <br /> A brief not in this.
