The film, a universal release of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring repetition of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy" and then sending it back to a "target area" . " There is no explanation of WHY this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by the mocking actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") believes it is something to devote to him, and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives for. <br /> <br /> During an experiment before the well-known Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails due to sabotage, for which he "projected" his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to search revenge. Of course, she ruins it and he comes out as a "pig roast" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this new power, he manages to kill some Cockney idiots, a security guy named Latham (Marney's Derrick) and his lab boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). You can also go into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat, too. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his team and himself. In general, a completely useless movie without any message. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color movies you'll ever see.
