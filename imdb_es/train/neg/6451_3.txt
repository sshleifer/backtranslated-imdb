"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) brings together a high school group for a meeting at the cabin location where his twin brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man (it reminded me a lot of the Gillman of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON) waits in the desert choosing the right moment to separate them one by one. Kat (Chase Masterson), an Ellen Ripley-type motorcyclist, who behaves badly, has an underground military bunker where she practices experiments, while also serving as a safe place from the bloody attack point of view. Kat knows more than she says (she also suffered the loss of a child), but there is another novel twist that most of the group has no idea about. This creature could be more human than they think ... and his previous identity could shed some light on a deception that only someone else has been hiding since Wes's death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unravel when the group stays near the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through its eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek type melodramatic that often prevent any real tension that is needed to form a small monster movie. The management is very insipid, which leads to a relatively boring experience instead of causing fear. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. The beautiful Maggie Grace (the new version of THE FOG) could be the only draw for this movie.
