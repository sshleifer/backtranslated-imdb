Make no mistake, this is neither a horror, nor really a movie. I strongly advise not to see this 82 minute failure; the only reason he deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently with the hope that there may be a turn, a touch of surprise, a plan to emerge, but no. <br /> <br /> The characters take erratic turns in their actions and, however, they do not. Do not have time to develop, thanks to the thrifty publishers and frankly embarrassed writers, before returning to an idyllic and playful state (bring the teen rock set). The only thing that could have made it worse would be to add the perishable ethnic token "mate". <br /> <br /> Your encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are brief, confusing and totally useless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine struggles to stay on the surface while drowning in the misery of a lightweight cast. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be drier if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> Look at 'The Road', watch '28 days Later ', watch television at any time of the day ... anything but this; I beg. He suffers from boredom, unlike what he can be made to believe in the movie, this movie has no cure.
