My Name is Modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I expected or expected. Although I've been aware of the character of Modesty Blaise for years, I'm not too familiar with comic strips or graphic novels, so I enter this film as something alien. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The movie is driven by dialogue. I guess I was looking for something with a little more camping value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a very serious movie. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. The performance, at least of Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing exceptional. As others have commented, she seems a bit too fragile to be completely credible in the title role. The action scenes in My Name is Modesty are one of the weakest points of the movie. I never accepted the idea that this woman could handle a band of trained assassins. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino will go ahead and make the rumor a big budget movie based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I would expect it a lot.
