My wife and I had high hopes in this movie, but it was a big disappointment. It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails in everything he tries, for example. Fishing, hunting, in an obvious way, subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process he lies to his son several times about several obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. The children and the wife are very real, which makes the film even more sad. I do not understand humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people making a fool of yourself. I do not understand how this could have arisen for the awards. Save your dollars, it's not worth the rent.
