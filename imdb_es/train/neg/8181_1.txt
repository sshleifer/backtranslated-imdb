I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina) ... I just could not see it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of Cutting Moments and take a look from time to time. When it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt dizzy. I only had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the second short film started (BTW, of course, I was not the only one who left the theater). It was WAAAAY too violent and unpleasant for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who really loved him. I just do not understand how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking, bloody and horrible images that I saw were stuck in my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw it all and told me about it) and I do not think it makes sense. I mean, that amount of violence and those things have no more meaning than trying to surprise people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that can say "Well, at least the 'x' thing about that was good." But hey, I guess I'll never understand that kind of movies.
