This film tries hard, but it completely lacks the fun of the television series of the 1960s, which I'm sure people remember fondly. Although I am 17 years old, I saw some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was nice and fun. Unfortunately, this movie does not do justice to the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are quite below the standard, and this was not helped by the flat camera work. The script was also boring and lacked sense of awe and humor. Other movies with scripts below par are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was poorly executed and ran out of fuel too soon, and honestly I'm not sure for this reason, this is something for the family to enjoy. And the talking suit bothered me, despite the energetic work of Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But what angered me the most about this movie was that it squandered the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah. , all the very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has achieved some good performances before, but he did not seem to have any idea what he was supposed to be doing, and Elizabeth Hurley's character sadly became useless. Daryl Hannah is a charming actress and, in general, ignored, and I liked the idea that she was the love interest, but, unfortunately, you see very little of it (not to mention that the Monster attack will scare the children more than captivate them) equally with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government agent. Christopher Lloyd defends himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot (he was in two of my favorite movies, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love Back to the Future) but they gave him little to work, and he had a tendency to exaggerate quite. <br /> <br /> In general, as much as I wanted to like this movie, it did not impress me. Instead of being fun, it was useless, and that's a shame because it had great potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
