This is the worst movie I paid to watch and, with the exception of "They Saved Hitler's Brain", the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and, therefore, I was anticipating what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since I did not have the restrictions with which TV improvisation programs should fight <br /> <br /> The writers must have thought that we are going to throw some rudeness, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side that divides the laughable comedy. The parodies of the game shows are nothing more than cheap, unimaginable takeoffs from Let's Make to Deal with stupid stupidity. The sit com session involving the single girl and her boyfriend was simply a high school bad mood. The stun gun ad was suitable for Seasame Street. The sketch of the Los Angeles subway was a bland humor that used a taste of tasteless blood. The French chef who blindly walked around saying "no difference" with a French accent was, well, I understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> The only funny sketch involved was Chevy Chase, which lasted a full minute. This means that you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I read the comments about the whole country being stoned in the 1970s and you'll like this movie if you're tall. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 70s. If the inept writers were stoned, they should have taken medication for sinusitis. There were 4 other people in the theater besides me when I saw this movie. Of course, it was still not known how bad the movie was.
