Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I'll find them nice. This is so bad that I do not have words to describe it, it's under "bad". There is an instruction at the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beers could not help me throughout the film. A tagliner compares this with KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. This tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting this one, look it up! If you are thinking about buying, do not think about it! If you are unfortunate enough to have this DVD, do not reproduce it, throw it in the trash immediately.
