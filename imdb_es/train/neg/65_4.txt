I do not have the qualification for The Amati Girls and I think it was REALLY nice giving it a 4 out of 10. What might otherwise have been a wonderful story with a series of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clich√©s in that movie, women's hair is just horrible and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem false. There is no real passion in this movie, but there are a lot of actors who act in excess over any limit that hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake to play, so in my opinion it's not good. When I saw it, I could not believe how something like this came to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe he was still fine and lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen in my life, and certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
