I have tried to watch this program several times, but for a program called "That '70s Show", I do not find much apart from some haircuts and the occasional reference to a nightclub that actually evokes the 70s, the decade in which I grew up Of the episodes that I have seen, most of the plots and jokes can be established in any period of time. Eliminate the novelty of (supposedly) to be established in the 70s, and the program is neither interesting nor fun. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a program that represents more successfully the experience of young people in America. In the 70's, in my humble opinion, you can not do anything better than "The Wonder Years".
