I can not believe that this movie was made in 1984. He has a ridiculous performance, not to mention one of the stupidest arguments of all time. Who would ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to accompany an Italian who illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie does not tell you anything about it, in fact, it is a generic title for an aspiring police / action movie as I can think. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw it on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They comment on the resemblance of the female lead with Elaine de Seinfeld ("None of them is suitable for the sponge") and the continuous riff of Baker's weight. This movie probably is not worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation definitely precedes it here: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I wish I was illiterate so I would not have to read that."
