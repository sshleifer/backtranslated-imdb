Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously insipid "film" is like digging into the chest cavity with a rusty and salty spoon. Maybe "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a little on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most brazen offers in marketing that I've heard of. A boy who fights spies / terrorists when he's alone at home in a suburb of Chicago with chicken pox? Ridiculous! Why did this movie have to be made? I am the kind of person who believes that even terrible movies are not waste of time, but rather learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It must be avoided at all costs.
