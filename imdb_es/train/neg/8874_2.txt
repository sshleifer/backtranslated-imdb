But there are not too many. Probably the worst "great release" movie I've ever seen. Definitely the worst for this year. It does not make sense to comment on the plot, the cast or the performance. The problem is beyond all that. It is in the absolute stupidity of the annoying type (not the funny guy) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, by Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line: 95 minutes washed in the toilet along with a few brain cells. Avoid at any cost.
