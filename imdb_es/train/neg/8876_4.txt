A kind of family parody that combines "An officer and a gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and certainly other movies that I can not remember now) in a fairly boring movie, with some bright spots. The gags are always there where I would wait for them, and the Damon Wayans lines are, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
