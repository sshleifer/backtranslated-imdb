You probably heard this phrase when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap" and yes, it's true. This movie is really scary and totally boring. <br /> <br /> This must be the second worst movie in which Lindsey has been seen since the Confession of the Teenage drama queen. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the excess of talent that, by far, is better than the movie millions of times and is the only point of sale of the film. I do not see how a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be part of this movie, do not you read that horrible script before you sign up to be in it? <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and has an extraordinary ability, climbing on the wall and going faster than a race car, after all, it's just a Beatle. I know it is a movie for children, but they have exceeded that and it is simply more foolish than entertaining. It takes a bit of realism and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Final words: Unless the children are between 5 and 12 years old, I very much doubt that anyone can enjoy this meaningless movie. What a waste of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Rating: F)
