... of this horrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, acting, writing, directing, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something goes up to the top and it's proven to be the worst. Music! I noticed that the movie has two listed composers. This must be the reason why each frame has music, the style of the movie "D", the worst of the worst. You have never heard of the expression "less is more". It was so painful to hear that it silenced the sound every time there was no dialogue, it was not that the dialogue was so good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own risk.
