This piece of dirt is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap, the quality of the image goes from bad to worse back to good. Things happen for no apparent reason, the characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer a massive brain injury during its production? <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the movie, the story is vile, simply evil, evil. If you like rape, murder and self-harm, this is your decision. alley. And if simulated murder scenes are not enough, you can enjoy clips of real people executed. I observed almost everything, but I had to turn it off after seeing someone's brain fly. I've never seen a movie before that left me so ashamed and dirty.
