DOC. SAVED: THE BRONZE MAN (1 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A frightening and frightening movie ... based on the pulp / pocket series of Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a superhero Hero of the adventure in the 30s and its five assistants, all experts in some field of work that allows them to fight evil. It was a pretty funny series ... but a little fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they did a version for the movie in the 70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had the chance to see her. I never played in the theaters where I lived and they never showed me on TV. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The plot and the characters are never treated seriously ... it's a kind of joke and joke ... something like the old Batman television series ... only without the benefit of being funny ... or having any visual image. instinct. Corny's dialogue, special cheese effects, stupid stereotypes, unpleasant action scenes and bad acting. In fact, I find it fascinating because of its evil ... what could they have been thinking? It was rumored that Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in a modern remake ... but I do not think it turned out to be much better.
