Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is still probably one of the worst movies ever made. He has Bruce Lee die as a result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by a kind of ninja knife in the back of the neck, but it does not explain how he got to be in a helicopter since the previous scene has him nearby. but not in the helicopter that is already 200 feet in the air. It just becomes completely absurd thereafter, like something out of a cheap comic book. Maybe the idea is not so bad, but it is not done with any degree of art from the point of view of a movie. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre by adding plausible stories in his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90 percent of the martial arts movies made during the 70s and early 80s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of trash cinema in my opinion, even though Bruce Lee is in it.
