This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who has said that the performance is excellent and that the casting is excellent, I have never seen a mediocre cinema. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you know. Lame. I feel that all the other "upward" comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed with the story, but I just wanted to see a beautiful Oregon field, and there was a good picture, but the casting was something that inspired BUT. I think this movie also mocks the generally noble suggestion that something profound in Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost, and that reviving it is worthwhile and possible. Place jokes in the wrong places and too obvious, and it makes me think that it was written by the State Department or something like that. Back to the drawing board. Even to suggest that this film deserves a place in the same neighborhood of classics as Harold and Maude is absolutely retarded, and in the same line of begging and pretense and "joke", as it is rampant in this film.
