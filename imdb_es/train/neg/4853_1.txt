I am a big fan of war movies and, as a Vietnam combat vet, I have some experience with the technical details. I worked with the types of bombs more than once and I have nothing but respect for them. Other veterinarians, and veterans from Iraq in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this film very well. The poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and it fails because of that. No bomb disposal unit, or any other unit, would have ever tolerated this dishonest operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units value conformity and discipline for a reason: it saves lives. The opening scene particularly bothered me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Shouting, "Stop marking" is not an effective impediment. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly atrocious. As others have noticed, your average EOD guy does not know anything about being a sniper, and to think that any Arab sniper is so good that it really stretches the imagination. The kidnapping of an Arab businessman for some kind of personal revenge simply would not happen. Someone could shoot him, but this kind of risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins a prize, it is a further reflection of why "La La Land" is so called.
