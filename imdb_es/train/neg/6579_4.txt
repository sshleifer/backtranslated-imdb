"New Best Friend" is another entry in the subgenre "steals the life of another woman"; the best of which is "Single White Female" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"; The worst of what you can see almost any afternoon on the channel for life. For some reason, this type of identity theft is exclusive to women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this kind of story. It can make the woman evil at first and let the public see her knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme. Or use the wrong direction to make it look like a good person, since a series of seemingly unplanned events break in your favor until it is revealed to be evil in the climate scene. Unfortunately, the creators of "New Best Friend" could not decide how they wanted to play and things are broken and burned before. First we meet Alicia (Mia Kirshner) scamming the financial aid office of the university to get scholarship money. Now we know that she is a bad person and will be suspicious of all her subsequent activity. But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spent the next 50 minutes making the wrong address to make us think that Alicia is a good person. This introduces the only element of suspense, not about whether she is evil, but about when the director and editor will know and stop wasting time with a transparent deviation. <br /> <br /> "New Best Friend" suffers more than most of the teen film, the curse of a cast too old to portray undergraduate students. There are really only two major parties, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of production. It almost works for Kirshner, 26, when she plays the mystical version of Alice, but becomes dazzling when she turns into the glamorous version of Alice. Monroe's casting is simply a joke, as if Nicholette Sheridan tried to pass as a classmate in "Lizzie McGwire." She looks much closer to a midlife crisis than a final job. <br /> <br /> Producers must have given him many favors because this age problem extends to most of the supporting characters. Taye Diggs, who plays the sheriff of the city, is younger than most of the students. <br /> <br /> The basic configuration is that Hadley and two other rich girls (played by Dominque Swain, 21 and Rachel True, 35) are roommates at the university. They share (as their student residence) a mansion that is prettier and better furnished than the mansion in Real World-New Orleans (a more credible premise than soccer moms who play with students). Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadley's life. At least that way, Swain finally gets a roommate of his own generation so that the two can have a lesbian scene. Swain's support performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend" and his love scene with Kirshner is fantastic, so great and artistic that it does not fit with any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted to a good director and filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The story, unintentionally hilarious, is presented in a series of twisted and sad scenes of rampant sex and non-stop parties, each of which comes from a picture of Alice in a hospital bed . Approximately half of Kirshner's screen time is spent motionless with a tube in his mouth. It's not a good career change, Mia. <br /> <br /> Then, again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
