I just finished seeing the guinea pig - demon experiment. I have to say that this movie, although it has very good effects, better than I expected, it was NOT a good movie. Honestly I can not say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it very boring (and not as bloody as I expected). And I also realized that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and laughed trying to sound hard all the time, that ruined it even more (and I'm sure there are people who will agree with me on that). Now I have seen the guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best of all in my opinion is the guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much more about the Demon experiment, apart from Great fx, the descent of the girl, the annoying torturers, in general I give it 4 stars because of the special effects because they are incredible.
