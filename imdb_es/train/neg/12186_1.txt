This remake of the original film of 1962, the book has some very good parts to praise it and some good performances by some excellent actors. However, Scorsese opts for the end because of the plot of the most formulated plot and for an excessively exaggerated Shakespearean shame that I had Looking at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is an excellent actor, dedicated to giving everything he does in the work he does, however he needs guidance to concentrate his talent, and this is very deficient in the last five minutes of The Movie. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is useful, but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this one. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte becomes a better performance than Lorenzo's oil, but it is not in the same way as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great lines, while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? Credits start (!), The first view of Cody's back when performing prison dives, the scene in which Cody is attacked with baseball bats, that of Sam Bowden turns to panic, the outer presence of Cody calm but disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The worst? The "cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Clinging bare hands to the bottom of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no speed bumps in the United States?) "He's dead, BUT NOT REALLY !!!" The parties and the final mentioned separation. <br /> <br /> You may see the original again, but I have not yet been tempted to see the remake in four years since I saw it.
