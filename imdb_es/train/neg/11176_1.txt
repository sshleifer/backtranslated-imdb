I saw this movie in an early preview, and I can not emphasize enough that I thought it was this movie. From the beginning, the audience was complaining about Pacino's horrible southern accent. Poor Al looked very, very haggard, and I can not decide if this was part of his role as a drug addict publicist, or maybe he just did not sleep at all before arriving on the set. Much worse than Pacino's close-ups, however, is the unfortunate excuse for a plot. At the beginning of the movie, they give us indications that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that is what the scriptwriter had originally thought. Later, however, we are supposed to suspend our disbelief and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both are sleepwalkers with foolish roles) covet this elderly, half-dead, effeminate man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part in general was the main thread, which had to do with a corporate espionage that is never fully explained and that never, never matters to us in the least. Because this was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment, due to the possibility of re-releases and editing, but you can bet I will not pay a penny to see this in theaters.
