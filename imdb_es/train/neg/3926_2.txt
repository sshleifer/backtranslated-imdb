This Italian film is basically a soap opera with skin. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was classified as "R", but the tape on the actual tape inside said it was "X". The latter makes much more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see the Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers practicing all kinds of sex with this guy and, yes, you could see her penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time that an "actress of the main line" had done something like that on the screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers walks naked in various scenes, but his face was even better than his body. She looked beautiful Unfortunately, the movie is ugly ... it's a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite the looks of the Detmers.
