You know, I went to see "The Hills have eyes 2" wanting to like it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was quite entertaining. Obviously, they had more money to spend than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time. Even though I still prefer the original movie, the new version was well made, and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fanatic. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack of one, is thin as paper. Here we are not exactly breaking new ground. The army has decided to monitor the area and all these people disappear. So, what do we do now? We're going to send the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we have to turn them into the dumbest and worst soldiers we've ever seen. Wow, I've never seen that premise before. To summarize the story, you have the mutants killing the imbeciles one by one graphically. Once again, Nicotero's special effects are excellent, but the murders, no matter how graphics are boring and predictable. Honestly, I thought that this movie was made just to earn fast money. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring and without any fear. For me, it would have been good if this movie contained an original thought. We, Craven and his son shared the writing duties, and he has participated in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
