Shirley Jackson's novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric horror story, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The environment is well established, and the chills are well organized. A disturbing masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 'The Haunting' cooler stays close to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, so the horror of the book and the chills run even better on the screen. Black and white photography only adds to the spooky film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then, Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, the new version of The Haunting hit theaters, if I could call it a new version. The reason why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for now, let's take a look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> It starts halfway, like most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and strangely mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems that the movie is really going to be a fair re-narration. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord cable cuts the face of a woman (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> As of that moment, the film simply spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat rigid as the film progresses, and the character of Owen Wilson is particularly irritating (so it is a great relief when he is beheaded by the chimney). <br /> <br /> Special effects practically make this movie, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very old-fashioned. Some examples are many, so I will not bother to list them. <br /> <br /> So, in general, along with hundreds of others, I strongly recommend that you see the original cooler or, as an alternative, buy Shirley Jackson's novel. But please, stay away from this. And, if you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (since many of the channels love projecting this movie and not the original) or rent it at low cost, but do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final grade: 4/10
