I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read the reviews for months about the winning performances. I mean, with the power of the star of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie can not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? INCORRECT! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not coincide with the advertising enthusiasm that was given and the only saving thanks were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> James Brownesque's performance of Eddie Murphy rescues the film just as it reaches its multiple breaks and Jennifer Hudson's performance forces you to pay attention every time you're on the screen. His interpretation of "And I'm telling you" was the only time I felt that the drum was deserved. You cringed when she begged no good man to let her stay in the group and in her life. As many critics have said, he steals the film from the most experienced actors and deserves all the accolades he receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, toured their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary performance of "Ray" and Beyonce Knowles was in an extended fashion photo or video session, posing and moving throughout the film. His performance was not strong enough for you to worry about his character at any time in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was too exaggerated, 30 minutes and 1 song (the only "sincere" Beyonce for Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
