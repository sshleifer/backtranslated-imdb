Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the city of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night, during a sinister full moon, they drive and argue along a slippery and winding mountain road. Without looking properly, they collide with another car and one or more of them are killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Pretty bad and politically correct horror movie without blood and nudes. Obviously it is influenced by the "Carnival of Souls". The cinematography is decent. , unfortunately, there is no suspense.4 out of 10, just another easy-to-forget adolescent crap.
