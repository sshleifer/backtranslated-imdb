Excuse me, have I missed something? Did I leave early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and false!) Stories made me think "This is going to be a classic" But everything went downhill from there! The acting was brilliant, for what William H Macy is worth is fantastic and it improves and improves every film in which I see it. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big moment in which all the stories are interconnected and then, suddenly ... it rains? It was if the writer said: "I have delved into how I can put all these stories together intelligently ... Oh, damn it, I'll have it raining frogs." I like smart movies, I like strange movies but this was weird and boring. 4/10
