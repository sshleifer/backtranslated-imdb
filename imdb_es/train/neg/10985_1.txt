I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and I was so excited to know there was a movie in the works. I am aware that the translation of the book to the movie is not perfect, but this movie was the worst of all. The names of the women are correct and part of the previous story is correct, but that's it. I feel like I lost a lot of my time trying to get over this movie. This really should have been a miniseries to tell the story as it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen, although at first I was skeptical about Mary -Louise Parker. I just wish they had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book.
