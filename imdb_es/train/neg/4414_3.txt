Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorable nun, because he can not let go of the concept. The play, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all for you," was presented, at least in Hollywood, in the same tone as Diane Keaton's conference scenes. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a labyrinth, a bitter satire of a very serene, doctrinaire and very critical nun, and played by Lynn Redgrave, she was very funny. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously, while, as mentioned, we keep the same tone in the "it explains everything" scenes. The two approaches collide suddenly and in the last twenty minutes, the film goes off the track, sinks in the throat and explodes. There are no survivors. It might have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four alumni, and her encounter with Sister Mary, had been presented in the same way as the scenes of Sister Mary. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary have been presented more realistically. In this way, it simply does not work at all.
