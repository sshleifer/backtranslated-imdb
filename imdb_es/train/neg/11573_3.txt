I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to install, and the ones I found made it look unmissable. How cheated I feel! <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be noted from the start that this is a daytime movie for a housewife. The performances are made of wood, each phrase is an attempt to "touch" in the way that daytime movies and bad soap operas of housewives always are, and is based on that predictable and foreseeable premise that men ( especially the soldiers) are essentially violent dispassionate The whole film is about the apparent 'drama' in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If that sounds tolerable (or even pleasant), then I warn you. Linda Hamilton's German accent, though quite good, distracts painfully, as does her face, for some reason. The other performances are undoubtedly a permanent source of shame for their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations that are the order of the day. There are few surprises, but notice the endless amount of food and drink of 'Monty Pythonesque' that miraculously appears in the backpacks of the hungry soldiers. <br /> <br /> I did not expect any action, but I was waiting. Beautiful or textured or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas "Feelgood" story that will have an intelligent audience that will shudder at the stupidity of all this. <br /> <br /> Look at it in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are a fan of the predictable 'The housewife faces men and wins television movies. 3: The only way to appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a movie. 4: You have drunk enough for your emotions to stir easily with an unsophisticated narrative.
