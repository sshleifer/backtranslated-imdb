By the way, this gives something of the plot. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy the party. This, however, does not. Try to capture the emotion of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even another work of Christmas, but it fails with dull and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the spirit of Christmas, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason, he needs to be in her letter) so instead she decides to name him Sam, because she knows how to do it. spell sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in the play with one word a day: "Listen!" She instead says hockey stick (har har). If Sally saying hark 12 times (all with a strange sound exactly the same) does not kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a great focal point, but that does not improve it. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. It sounds like a child (that does not dispel the rumors) and gets angry when it has to be the sheep in the play (terrible baas and everything). Apparently, she is the sheep every year, and she is worried that she will forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions him twice, one after the other, and gets the same answer. I guess she must have short-term memory loss, or something like that. Lucy and Linus are most welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but they hardly represent much time on the air. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this. All in all, try to be a parasite of the original, but compromise the message for a few quick laughs.
