Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has to be the worst television show ever made. There is no plot, just a group of disguised children who wear martial arts while wearing second-class spandex outfits. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like they're from the 70s, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the TV show is the toys, only the second-class plastic trash that is fed to our children. <br /> <br /> There are much better programs for your children to see! <br /> <br /> Try giving your children something like Nickelodean, those programs really have some intelligence behind them, unlike the Power Rangers.
