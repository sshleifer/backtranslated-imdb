I saw this movie last night after a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try to find out who is who and what it means you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this movie, the film jumps out of different stories and does not allow you to feel empathy with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For political fans and those interested in corruption in other governments around the world, this movie is probably pretty good, but for the average movie viewer, this movie is awkward, very boring in some places and will leave the cinema confused and annoyed because he paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> see if you are ready to focus You are 100% interested in every detail or policy. Do not see it, if you really like watching movies.
