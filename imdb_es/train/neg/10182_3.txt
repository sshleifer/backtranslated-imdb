Okay, just by reading the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well but it became very boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> Tells a story about a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader who will do everything possible to get what she wants. The only problem is that your daughter's friend is the girl on the road. She always wins the competitions, therefore, pushes the mother more towards "eliminating" her. After speaking with a "hit man", the mother decides that the girl needs to be mistreated a little. So actions are taken, but finally it is trapped. <br /> <br /> The cast is horrible and the film goes on for too long without anything happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
