This was one of the most vague movies we saw in recent months with a predictable plot and a pretty bad performance (mainly of the secondary characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously made a great effort to learn to dance Samba, but the scope of his character it is only necessary to dive in the child's end of the pool. The film is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music, but they are not enough to make a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio, or inside a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10
