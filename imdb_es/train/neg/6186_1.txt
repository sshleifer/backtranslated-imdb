Miscasting happens. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35 years old. George C. Scott, white-haired, looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! Crunch and growl, hateful and grim. He looks like an ax killer who sent his ax to sharpen; No wonder you keep your wife caged in the attic! The great love story seems like a sadomasochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when it chooses to be. He has a good voice to speak and sing, a good mind and a conscience that he tries to suppress without success.
