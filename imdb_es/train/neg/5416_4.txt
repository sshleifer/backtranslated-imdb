This was the third effort of the director von Stroheim: it is quite coarse and does not show the exceptional talent for the camera and the domain of the edition that would show a few years later with his masterpieces, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. Essentially we have a trio of grifters, disguised as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Your goal is to use counterfeit money at the gaming tables and earn a fortune. Part of that plan is that the Count (von Stroheim) insinuate himself between a visiting American ambassador and his "dumb" wife, courting her and hoping to earn some money by playing with his weaknesses. He makes the mistake of also taking the savings from the life of the maid, with whom he promised to marry. When he sees them together, he sets the room on fire (Von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim establishes for the first time his person as "the man you love to hate". It is completely bad and his defects of character eventually lead to a very bad and deserved end. The film is coarse in its cinematography and editing and is not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. There is a little cute: when he tries to meet the ambassador's wife for the first time, she is reading a book; we see the title: WIVES OF THE HIGH by Erich von Stroheim. Originally, this was conceived as a 210-minute film, reduced to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. The restoration in Kino Video restores the surviving images (damaged in some way in most of the scenes) of the previous alternative version to give us an impression of 107 minutes.
