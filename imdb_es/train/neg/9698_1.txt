There are many very talented filmmakers / actors in Germany now. None of them is associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why in the world do producers really invest money in something like this? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this garbage! It is not entertaining to have seven grown men running like dwarfs, pretending to be funny. However, what is funny is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest guy in the group) is playing the YOUNG dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments that scream for the subtitles that say "You are supposed to laugh now!". It's hard to believe that this shit is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Actually, many people stood up and left the cinema within 30 minutes of the movie. I should have done the same thing instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
