This is the most messy entry in IMDb that I have not yet found. All the previous critics act like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. Rather, it is simply an accessory that is an extra in the DVD of the movie "The One". In addition, not much is about the 90 minutes listed here. Actually, it's just over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. And his reflections on the film. So yes, this IMDb entry is pretty fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews, as they are all wrong. You can trust me, because I never fed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and that is the truth. I suppose you can say that I am the Reviewer "the One" what matters.
