I do not know what this movie was about that made me react so viscerally against it. Maybe it was the characters who did not like them and were not attractive enough to care about them. Maybe it was the disorganized plot. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long earring earring and earring. Maybe it was because at some point in the movie they all explode into a song. Maybe it was because the 1980s was never that of the 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a gaudy hyperbole. Maybe it was because a character pumped his fist while moving away from the camera during a fading. I do not know what it was that made me hate him, but if it means trying to see him again, I'm not willing to find out.
