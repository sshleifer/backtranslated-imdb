This is without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. What's worse, my old hero Dolph is in him and is starring him. Jesus ... The story is pretty good, but the way it was done made even my body hurt. For beginners, the fight scenes are as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks who get in the ditch. The actors, with the exception of Dolph, who also sucks, perform so poorly that they can not help wondering if their reason for being is that they are all friends of the director, who certainly must have been more absent, if not all the time. It is about 12 million euros spent in an unimaginable way, because by the aspect of the effects and the scenario, the cost can not be a penny over 1,000.
