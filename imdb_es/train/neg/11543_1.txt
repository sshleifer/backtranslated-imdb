Although I use this site quite often to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or simply enjoyable movies, after seeing this "movie" in film four last night, I felt compelled to write something, even if it helps me clean me one more time. <br /> <br /> The movie was possibly the most superficial experience I've had, the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) I did not have any real substance about them: I'm not sure if the first half hour of the film did not reach the last cut, but in a revenge movie I wish I had some empathy with the victims ... Here I could care less. In fact, the only character that seemed to care was the dog, and the deer came very close. And both animals surpassed Dire (sic) and Scully, which were downright terrible. I suppose that even though you are only as good as the script you are given, and I would like to warmly thank the writers, the producers, the director and the whole cast for losing 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity.
