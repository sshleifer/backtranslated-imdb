The other critics do not have the impression that this movie sucks because it is ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the US meat trade or Scottish slaughter of Scotland), it sucks because it is pretentious, so to speak. of a backup that gives modern art a bad name. Having said that, there are some impressive images, but there are impressive images in the average bus trip if you use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film happens very slowly and, often, accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a disemboweled cat, and then, when you think it's finished, it starts over. I saw him in a porn cinema in Rome, which had been hired for the weekend to show the works of Barney's film, which is an admirable and intelligent way to reclaim what was once a local of the city of men old and dirty. Brigade, but if the young fashionistas and Bjork fans who are a little older were honest, everyone could have had a lot more fun if they had shown one of the porn movies!
