OK another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. Okay, this is not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but it's still robbed me of royalty. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The Monster Jigsaw is a mixture of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just know you're in trouble when someone equips you with a buzzsaw and a shotgun cut, the movie was not as bloody as we expected, I mean, one of the deaths is a heart attack. Once again, I think the performance sucks, the sum of the actors must be porn stars and one should get into their underwear for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, it leaves it open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2, but that will never happen lightly, let's be honest. <br /> <br /> My grades: <br /> <br /> 4/100 fun drills (how much fun we mock) 73/100 acting 8/100 in general 12/100
