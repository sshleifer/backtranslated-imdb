Richard Dix is ​​a big industrialist, not very nice, who has almost worked to death. If you take the holidays that your doctors suggest, can you find happiness in the last months of your life? Well, it's probably better if you ignore the ASSOCIATOR'S VOICE. <br /> <br /> This entry directed by William Castle has some great moments (the introduction and description of the life of Richard Dix through citizen newscasts to Kane), and some intriguing plots on the final reels. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the simple does not work at all because one does not end up buying the characters behave as they do. In addition, the film changes from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost happy 30's movie as a middle section (full of good urban ethnic types who do not care if they are not rich) and back to a complex plot black for the last 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This is a decent movie, it's worth seeing, but I needed a little more career time to establish a couple of characters and a female protagonist capable of satisfying the demands of her role.
