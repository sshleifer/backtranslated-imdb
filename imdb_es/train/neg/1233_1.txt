Oh my God. The idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that seems to be written by a 5 year old boy. The plot, the acting and even the accessories and the filming of this movie were all beyond misfortune. <br /> <br /> Normally I am not so critical of any film, because every person has their style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst movie I've seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and I think it should go on like this, since movies like these make the thriller genre a joke. <Br /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of suspense films, or even just movies that stay away from it.
