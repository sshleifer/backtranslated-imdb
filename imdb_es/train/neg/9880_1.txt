I saw this movie in the first theatrical premiere, in a justifiably empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this is still clearly the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that would allow me to see. <br /> <br /> The performance is far below the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students taken off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene touched new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure dissipated and became very sad.
