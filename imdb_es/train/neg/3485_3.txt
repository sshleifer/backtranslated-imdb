This movie was pretty absurd. There were some funny parts. Go directly into the container of movies in my memory where I think, "Hmm ... that movie had some funny parts, but in general, a pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)". <br /> <br /> I thought it looked like Ben was trying too hard to be a funny guy. And he did not understand how he was a self-made billionaire and still an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does a little shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was his fault, I like it in general. I guess it's like the child you feel sorry for because you can not seem to do it right. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this movie. It really did not become a viable plot and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. In general, this film is NOT just for home, it is NOT a Christmas story, it is NOT a Christmas vacation or any of the other classics. Forever forgettable.
