I hated this show when I was a child. That was on the day that the children show that the characters actually had accents, not just the insensitive, generic, General American Dialect that we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was Southern. However, as I mentioned one of the others, I never quite understood what it was about dealing with the witch that the flute wanted. That always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute simply bothered me and I would not have taken the trouble to remove it. <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf with McDonalds commercials of the early 70s. Others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of the popularity of McDonalds, the television program (or, rather, its creators) sought to license the McDonalds characters for its program, but when McDonalds refused, the television program slightly changed the characters and passed them on as own. They even hired former employees of the advertising agency McDonalds and the voice actors to make the television programs. McDonalds sued and won. Search the Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you will find many articles about it.
