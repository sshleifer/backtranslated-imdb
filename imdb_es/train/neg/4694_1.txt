I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, he was anxious to get out of the seats as soon as Big Rig finished. Big Rig is comprised of several "big" drivers who set out to deliver products driven throughout the United States. All the characters are wonderful people, however, the filmmakers never delved into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but they never do. At the most, we get lost. We, the public, end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the narration, we end up somewhere but without direction, location or argument. Why are we here? Where we are? How do we get here? The narrative is neglected and the intention of the directors to "humanize" a group of people they consider "overlooked" and "invisible" is presented as unconscious and irritatingly condescending. The problem here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors present their own naive assumptions about the truck drivers and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. In general, the story lacks tension, the film is too long (it should have been a 15-minute sketch), the big question of "Then, what" is never answered, and the whole movie is a piece of transparent propaganda that does nothing that "illuminates" (as the directors affirm) the outside world about the great riggers.
