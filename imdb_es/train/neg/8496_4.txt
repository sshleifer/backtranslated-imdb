Have you ever seen a movie composed entirely of long and wide shots? Do not? Me neither. Well, I've finally seen one in "Spring in my hometown," and I must confess, now I know why people do not do this. The technique is "artistic", without a doubt, but it is definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is very defective simply because the viewer does not have an emotional bond with the characters, and perhaps it is the intentions of the director. I do not know, I can not read minds, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to pass judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments. As an American, I am very aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am well aware that we were not always angels, but I would be damned if I take this version of how things work. It happened According to this foolish blind man, Americans were not only at the root of the war, but we were the CAUSE of war, and we destroyed the country almost without help. Whatever, Mr. Director. And I guess you would still be doing this movie in COMMUNIST KOREA if we had not interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your story. This is almost similar to making the Nazis the "good guys" at the same time that they turn the allied forces into "bad guys". This film is so ingenuous from the historical point of view and is so inaccurate that it is almost shameful to see it. For a man who comes from a country that owes its EXISTENCE to the interference of the United States, surely it turns out to be tall, powerful and critical.
