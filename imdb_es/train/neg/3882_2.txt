Why do I do this constantly? I mean, really, it's right there in the title: "The Incredible Melting Man." What else can I expect? I must admit that I'm an imbecile for almost anything I've encountered in the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature of this image would be that truly grotesque makeup work done by the legendary Rick Baker. As for the creepy thing, I'll give the go-ahead to that couple of horny old men sucking lemons just before the lights go out. Now they were really frightening. <br /> <br /> Something I could never discover in horror movies was why the victims of a monster simply did not escape when faced with a virtual annihilation. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run off at any time. The incredible Steve-O could not gather much more than a brisk walk, so why not fly directly to his side? I do not know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feeling of an episode of 'Tales From The Crypt', but 'Tales' usually had a great or grotesque touch that many times you did not see coming. This was a picture that you could not handle or go. For example, in an early scene, you can clearly see that Melting Man's eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage to move through the rest of the story? I guess we should not ask. <br /> <br /> At eighty-four minutes, this image lasted about an hour and a half. When it was over, he was ready to talk to General Perry about his previous suggestion: "I could really have a drink now."
