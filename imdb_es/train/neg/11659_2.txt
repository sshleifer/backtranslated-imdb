I loved the original scary movie. I'm a big fan of parody, it's my favorite form of humor. Sometimes it is considered as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to capture that concept perfectly in the original movie, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a promise. I liked the parody of "The Exorcist", especially the "gag". Now, that's quality Wayans material. But, apart from that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then it becomes sticky and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he is saying, "It was just a booty call!" That was a little fun. 2) The parody of "Save the Last Dance" where Cindy's character inadvertently hits a girl while practicing her new moves. But even short giggles are no match for the laughs of the first scary movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is trash, full of cheap and cheap jokes. The jokes of the first movie that were subtle or implicit are magnified and exaggerated. For example, in Scary Movie I, several hints are made to imply that Ray's character is gay. This was hilarious But, in Scary Movie II, the whole scene of strangulation of the penis with Ray under the bed was amazing and incredibly graceless. This is the pattern of the whole movie. Shock humor * alone * does not carry a movie far away. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one 2 out of 10.
