I could have given this movie a higher rating before the Peter Jackson trilogy came out, but seeing the two side by side there is simply no comparison. The rhythm of this film is hurried, many important scenes of the book are left out and there is little development of the character. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted, which distracted me. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some good points: the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book largely to the letter. Look at it if you're in a hurry and you can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you are probably confused, because there is a lot missing in this version. 4 out of 10
