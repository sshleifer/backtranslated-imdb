Let's face it: if you rented a sequel to STDVD from a forgotten gem of the 80s, and you expected it to be better than the previous one, then you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this do not need spoilers, because YOU already know them. <br /> <br /> The "argument" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd knows the girl; girl likes nerd nerd likes the girl; Nerd accidentally gets involved with the top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government demands in the other country; The nerd and the girl meet an important old man who dies at a key moment of the "movie"; the nerd and the girl are captured; The Secret Government computer goes crazy; Nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd defeats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret computer from the first "movie" of Wargames; nerd saves the day; nerd lies down <br /> <br /> End. <br /> <br /> The acting, the script, the effects, the score and the cinematography are what you would expect: B-grade. Some familiar faces are here and, unless you're a huge fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one. Of course, the movie will not make you crazy enough to eat your toes when you see it, so if you like the sequels of STDVD that seem cheap, then you're at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was also involved with some "masterpiece", which could not even make a five-second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?
