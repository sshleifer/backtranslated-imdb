I am still trying to determine if the previous delivery was worse than this, or vice versa. Since I saw this movie almost fifteen years ago, the fact that I remember so little is not a good omen. Maybe it's just because I only saw it once or twice, but I doubt it. If there was anything worth remembering about this movie, you can be sure that you would remember it. <br /> <br /> At the moment this movie was released, the franchise was still entering its final phase, so there is a lot of media coverage. He was assigned. It's never a good sign when Teenie Pop magazines contain explanations of the basic concepts of the plot. One of those articles had to explain that Freddy was too weak to infest the dreams of adult humans, so he decides to go in search of Alice's unborn child. So far, all right, but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to an unrelated publication. <br /> <br /> Making use of the triviality given in the third part about the conception of Freddy, one could almost expect scenes that would take this joke out of the category "baby horror", but alas, that was not going to be. This shows the absolute idiocy of the American classification system that a B'harni piece of garbage like this could get the same rating as a really scary piece like the original one. <br /> <br /> At this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a competent performance ratio. Or maybe he just looks competent compared to the rest of the cast. Either way, given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade, I doubt she really had anything else going for her. Even poor Robert Englund has had better productions than in the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Given that the box office returns were in constant decline, and not just for this franchise, at that time, one would. I thought the studios would realize that neutralizing their films does not make them more salable . In fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was so neutralized that it not only failed to attract a new audience, but also managed to alienate the main audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this, part five should be given some credit for not having the bright luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to watch. <br /> <br /> I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five one one in ten. In trying to attract everyone, or the idea of ​​all on the part of the MPAA, he succeeds in appealing to anyone. Like parts two and four, one could erase it from continuity altogether, and no one would notice the difference.
