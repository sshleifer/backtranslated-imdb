Do not ever see this movie again ... it's the biggest pile of shit I've ever encountered in my life. and that is saying something. The acting, the plot and the filming were absolutely terrible. IT'S THE MOVIE MOVIE OF THE WORLD !!! Seriously, does not it even give you a success since it cost me 99 pts of sainsburys and was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap movie from the university, you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen ... although if you really want to see it, you have to see the "shark fear scene" ... possibly the best piece I've seen it in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously, this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours!
