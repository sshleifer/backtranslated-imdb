Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this, even though Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach are stars much bigger than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a spin on the movie "Alien Lands on Earth". Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an extraterrestrial pursued by the army and takes the fugitive creature with his very sexy costume. A little nudity and a partial nudity, a scene of meaningless sex appear along the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles over some obvious pieces and jokes about how to show photographs. I liked Star Trek jokes when they took Micheal Dorn and he got a really great death scene. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken and the movie had quite a weak ending, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien had passed on to Eggert.
