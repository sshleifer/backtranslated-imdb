Seeing him live at night makes you wonder who just lit up this shit. A newly married couple enjoys their honeymoon, is attacked by bats and the husband begins to run in pajamas attacking several people. And where are they exactly? They are in the desert, then they are skiing, then they are in a small town that seems to have mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against the weeping baby doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really cool guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end will leave you full of anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made the effects for this movie. I guess you have to start somewhere.
