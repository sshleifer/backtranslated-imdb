Tobe Hooper is possibly the greatest coincidence that the horror genre has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved the Texas chainsaw, but I think that to put your name in front of a movie title, you must have at least more than one successful movie. I really can not think of any other movie that Hooper has made (on his own, do not count Poltergeist) that really has had an impact on the horror genre or the world of cinema. And this movie, Night Terrors, supports my point of view. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for at least doing a good job with the horrible material they gave him. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure drudge. Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written on a stage, music and cinematography really ours, and just horrible. Nothing in this movie is redeemable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> In general, 1 out of 10. I'm sorry for Hooper, it looks like his career was over before it really started. I hope he is able to release at least one more good movie, that way he can do justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
