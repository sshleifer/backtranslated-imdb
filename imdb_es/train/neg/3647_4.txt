It's good that I did not see this while I was pregnant. I would definitely have cried and / or vomited. It was a bit frightening, mainly disturbing. Personally I thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted way. However, as a mother, I cringed when Beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when Virgina miscarried the girl during her third trimester with rusty tools, no less. Also, as an animal lover I almost cried when I scratched the cat with a bloody pulp. However, as creepy and sinister as the baby was, I was wishing she lived. And as twisted as the movie, I am extremely intrigued to see the sequel ... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... .. ..
