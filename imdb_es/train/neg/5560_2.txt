It seems to have been fulfilled, any movie starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if it's the fact that the story is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler here, it seems that it was delayed pushing and pushing and grabbing and playing in this movie. In my opinion, it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to enter the can and the theater.
