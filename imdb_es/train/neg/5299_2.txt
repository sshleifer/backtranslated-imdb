I really like slasher movies, but this one is really horrible. The performance is scarce, the script is bad and the environment is nonexistent. The plot is as follows: a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American town. That's right, this is the plot. Very original, eh! "The Night Brings Charlie" is not bloody enough. If the movie is not scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap piece of garbage. at all costs. If you want to see some good slasher movies, take a look at "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - just do not waste your valuable time with this useless piece of junk
