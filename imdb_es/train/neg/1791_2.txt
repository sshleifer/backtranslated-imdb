What about the turbid video at the beginning and sporadically throughout the film? It's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity can make some people disappointed, but that, along with most of the bad acting, is what makes a cult movie good. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Oh, your race is mute!" Okay, nobody should say "ay" in a movie line unless they're English and live in the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Van Helsing's character acting and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Evil martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
