This film is about two former soccer players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny), who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with some negative background. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works to have sexual conversations over the phone. Jennifer is being threatened by a caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for help along with other ladies. Mack and Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Florida. golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of things happen in the city. There are many hits, murders and many words of double meaning that make this film completely ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
