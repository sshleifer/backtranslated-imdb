This is one of those movies that you think the manufacturers would refuse to release because it is very terrible. Obviously, they thought that children are stupid and excellent at absorbing endless advertisements and would think they are entertaining because it's fun. What about the talking car with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) The claw is supposed to be evil, not beautiful and charming. Why Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the drug authors when they wrote these scenes? It seems that they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with turning a man into an Android thing of fighting crime. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy in which if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you do not get a refund. I'm sorry I saw more than 30 minutes of that pile of garbage. After I was informed about the no refund policy, I decided to see the rest of the horrible garbage called Inspector Gadget.
