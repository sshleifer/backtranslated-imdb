Well, this was not the worst movie I've seen in my life, but I had heard many good things and was deeply disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers were coming from and who were trying to express the fact that the two parties in this battle were not very different from each other, that the individuals were getting lost in the fight, etc. (Well, that's my presumption, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> In any case ... the movie bored me. I've seen many really long movies, but this one seems to go on and on ... basically because I could not handle any of the characters. I kept thinking ... who cares? I also found that the performance was a pretty dead bread and the dialogue tensed. I understand that this was the 19th century and all that, but most conversations seemed unnatural. No one seemed to feel any emotion during most of the movie, except during the melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story did not seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a boy and you're a girl", which I do not consider a romance, and yet I felt that they were leading me to the belief that these people were in love. Oh, well ... I suppose it's all "all this horror that surrounds us, we have to hold on" kind of thing, or whatever. I also expected some kind of dynamic between the two best friends (both of whom seemed initially interested in the girl), but that was simply a kind of abandonment. Maybe avoiding a clich√© love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh, well ... Daniel Holt was the only character that I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I did not exactly dislike Jake, but he also seemed a bit ... no thorns, I guess. Jack Bull did not care at all. And I'm pretty sure you're supposed to hate everyone else, with the exception of poor people who just cut themselves from left to right. It was pretty graphic and I had all that "horrors of war" thing, but I've seen many other movies with the same theme, the better. (I enjoyed The Patriot a lot, for example, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative) But, as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
