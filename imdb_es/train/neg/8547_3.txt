This was a pretty spooky movie; I found the effective music for this. The photographs that Mario took of the village were also disconcerting. However, I had three problems with this movie. One of them is that the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was difficult to know what was happening, but this could have been my copy. The second is that the beginning is not explained very well and I am still not sure what was happening there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but apparently some people understand it. Of course, there are also the usual problems of people doing stupidities, and the male protagonist is very 70. In general, you can see, but not even close to being a favorite.
