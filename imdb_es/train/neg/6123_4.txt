When I was a teenager watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and his various states of undressing in this movie. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is horrible. Keep in mind that Bo Derek is incredibly beautiful, and she and her husband and director John Derek make sure they see her in abundance. But when you get that aspect of the movie, it becomes a big boring trip. And Tarzan, well, he's as muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This is despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet shirt, with a prominent chest. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to glide over a beautiful naked body, this could fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worthwhile film, go somewhere else ... to almost any other place!
