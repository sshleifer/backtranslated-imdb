Unless you are petrified by the Russians or the boars, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes and had to fight against the desire to leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was more scary. Fuck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was more scary. I still do not know what was supposed to be scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I am very leery of movies that use "Russian pidgin" as it did in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all shuddered. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, luckily for me (and probably for you too), this movie has already escaped me and I just left an hour ago. So I do not have details, only dark images that do not go anywhere and some hopes of languishing and dying now that something happens. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe it. I got excellent reviews here (which is why I saw it) and ended up being so completely destitute not only of Horror or Suspense, but also of a General Entertainment Value. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
