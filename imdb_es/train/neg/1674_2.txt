The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this movie just does not do it justice. The cast was quite good, and it was filmed perfectly, but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (it has been done too quickly and without any effect ... I expected Steven Bochco to participate in the credits followed by a commercial ), the characters were identified exclusively by the use of coke on screen (and practically everything that remains in Boogie Nights for the development of characters), and no character with personality to attract the viewer to the story. A very forgettable movie.
