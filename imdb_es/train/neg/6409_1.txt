I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who give more than one star should be fans of Buffy. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know shit when I see it. On all levels, this movie is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even within a scene, you jump POV like a madman for no reason. There is no logic in cinematic terms. Emotionally it is gloomy for the sake of sadness and tries to be a psychological thriller when it is simply confusing. Throwing unpleasant looking red necks in your movie is a cheap way to convey "atmosphere". I ran out of patience long before the last act, but I was having a lot of fun with my friends doing MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since she left Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful films, even if the "Scooby Doo" list on her resume could count. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) can not find a vehicle for her. And, Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to appear in a movie like this again. (In addition, Patsy Cline's estate must sue for defamation!)
