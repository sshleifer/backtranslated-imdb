In a good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: "The truth is that Americans use a secret alloy of anti-radiation aluminum, it is not as well known, and the exact specifications are a secret, and why it's a secret: well, why Should they reveal it back then? If they were in a space race with the Russians, it would be VERY foolish to reveal that they had new technology that could protect the crew against radiation. " This is completely incorrect. There is (and there was) no "secret" for protection against radiation in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo command module has been publicly available for a long time. It uses a light "honeycomb" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire exterior surface (except the windows, of course) is covered with a thermal shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker at the bottom that looks forward during re-entry. These materials are actually * better * to stop the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stop ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Spatial radiation is a definite problem for long-term space flight due to the risk of large solar flares. But it just was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them quite good protection during their brief (approximately half an hour) through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation each received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of whom disembarked), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men who are now over 70 (Shepard would be 86).
