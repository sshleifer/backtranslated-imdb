"So there's a girlfriend, you know, and she's crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on her wedding day." So, you understand this, a year later, her ex-fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful psychic? then, that beautiful psychic is haunted by the ghost of the unhappy dead wife who wants to prevent her from stealing from her boyfriend, he will be fun! "I like to imagine, that's how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed" Over Her Dead Body ", presented his concept to executives of New Line Cinema studio. The great mystery is how those same corporate tigers could turn the project around and give the project a green light, allowing Lowell to direct the film and write the script. <br /> <br /> Because if you do not think any film could ever be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another idea coming. The only way it could have worked is if the writer had just gone crazy with it and turned it into a satirical farce without limits. Instead, wanting to make sure he offered a diffuse, harmless, and good-hearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring stockings every step of the way, crushing the absurd in favor of monotonous conventionality. In fact, "Over Her Dead Body" is so inept and inoffensive that it's hard to know where Lowell thought he was going with that. Practically all the traps, jokes and gags that appear in the film have flat feet and are poorly executed, and even the actors themselves seem to be aware of their situation. How else to explain the half-hearted and lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have shown their talent in better vehicles in the past (that is the particular case of Rudd). But Lowell and the studio executives surely have to do some explaining.
