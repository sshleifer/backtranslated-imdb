In general, this movie is terrible, and should never have been made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link between the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel "God, no!", But you do not. In this case, you do not care because there is not a link that has been made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed that the movie would be great, however, there is no suspense like never before. Maybe there has been some mystery, but there is not. "All you have is a toolbox." It was said on the back of the DVD, you might think that this film was carefully planned and it was done with intelligence, but it is not like that, The ending, it was horrible, very direct and useless too. The performance is average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. The "special effects" and the sets were also normal, nothing special. There is not much blood, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was announced to make it sound quite surprising, but in reality, it's not worth looking for, I do not recommend it to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, with some fights and a boring story.
