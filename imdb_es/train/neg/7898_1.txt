When I saw this movie, I could not believe what I saw. Where are these hilarious creatures, garbage muppets with big pointed teeth, really pretending to be terrifying? Or where they were designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope it). If you look closely, you can even see the strings operating them (better, by dragging them across the screen). The set was more fun than scary and I had a great time watching the movie because I was surprised by its general inability to have only a good part. It's a great joke from beginning to end and I think this movie belongs to a new category: for the incredible thing that you're going to laugh from beginning to end. (I will not even try to comment on the acting or all the other things)
