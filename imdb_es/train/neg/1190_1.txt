The weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring him down. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely a pony of a single trick, I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table in this case as the Iron Chefs. The type of dishes that this duo really comes ... does not reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. Actually, I do not think Batali went to chefs school. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they do not appear on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and maybe co-hosts that can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is a little too frivolous / funny for this role.
