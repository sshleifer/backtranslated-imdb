I am a HUGE fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I was watching the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and I saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with some friends of mine and I rented it. We put it on and we were surprised to see Adam Sandler who has not yet reached puberty, it seems he was 12 when this movie came out. I could not even see 30 minutes of this shit, I did not laugh, I did not chuckle, I did not even smile in this movie, actually the only time I smiled when I saw that horrible movie. I could not believe how hard he tried to make the audience laugh in this movie ... and it did not work once. Although seeing the horrible angles of the camera and hearing the disgusting script, I realized why I had never heard of this movie, ... because it stinks more than I ever had before. This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie we DO ... NEVER!
