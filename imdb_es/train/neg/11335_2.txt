Recently I saw Belle Epoque, thinking it could be wonderful, since it won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. I was a little disappointed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Maybe the conflict I had was that from the moment the film was filmed until now, the plot of a man in love with beautiful women and finally falling in love with the good girl has been done so many times. Apart from the predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the plot (for example, a certain event at the wedding). Sometimes, the film was a bit preached in his ideas and in relation to Franco's time, the film was set and the Church. The only thing that the film had in its favor were the beautiful moments, the setting and the character of Violeta as a strong and independent woman at a time when women were not really associated with those characteristics.
