Woohoo! I saw the trailer of this and although 'nah, this is not for me'. I saw my husband's face and that of a friend during the trailer, and I knew it was a 'kid movie'. I mean, hi a group of little chicks that dance - another striptease? <br /> <br /> Then, I started seeing it, it did not look so bad. So I kept looking. I saw it until the end. what an awesome movie. In any case, this is a movie for girls. These girls have attitude It's really a movie to feel good, and a little love story. It really leaves you with a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of a girl from a small town who is getting big in the city, after going through the usual big city c ** p. There have been a couple of these, it's almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, me anyway. I think it's because all the work in a bar is very familiar, not only for me, but for many people I know. Do not trust the trailers for this, as it is meant to attract men.
