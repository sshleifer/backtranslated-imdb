Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie, and he was forced to play a Mexican part or he would have been suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong decision! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried to follow up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and the ever present John Litel, but they committed the Big mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to do things really bad, because he showed one thing, and that is that he can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with Bogie clearly bad too, it turned out to be a poor Westerner who was too long and on a low budget, but in fair terms, the color would not have helped.
