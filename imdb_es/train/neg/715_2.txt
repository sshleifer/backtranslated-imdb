This sounded like a very interesting propaganda movie. Nazis, occultism, government conspiracies. I expected a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys of Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychological, more like something from David Lynch. That was actually a plus point. But the way the story is told is horrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is casting. The character of Andrienne Barbeau starts the movement being somewhat shy and scared. He just does not do it well, even at his age, although he certainly tried. The cast actor as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to think that this was a corny movie, or at least they acted like that, instead of just being extravagant. The only one I thought was very good was the daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another important part is the rhythm. Start very slowly So slowly you may be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes convincing for a time when you get to the daughter's suicide and the consequences. But soon after, everything becomes a mess. Part of this was on purpose, but much of it was simply unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that it's just not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters is nice. Excessive use of images and sets. Some movies that you see are tortured. In this, it is the spectator who does. It has some spooky moments, especially the paintings and creepy Nazi credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just boring.
