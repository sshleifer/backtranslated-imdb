As seems to be the general essence of these comments, the film has an impressive animation (I saw it on Blu-ray) but it really does not reach any real depth. <br /> <br /> First of all, all the characters are pretty boring. It gave me a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However, maybe my mind wandered and this was an illusion (Laputa is my favorite animation, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really adorable and, as mentioned in another post, they fall exceptionally fast, leaving poor Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems not to realize this). However, it seems that soon Toola forgives at the end without another explanation for the change of heart, which makes the end a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. As who are really the druids? They are persons? And who are the strange women / girls who seem to go out with them and run the forest? There is nothing that explains why they are there and how they can give superpowers to normal humans. Plants that come from the moon still do not fill in the blanks on this. It's almost like a strange version of The Day of the Trigids. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? Why bother with this if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I did not find the plot as close as a movie like Ghost in the Shell or have a real character like those of Miyazaki. It does not bother me to see it, but I wish I had not bought it. My advice? Try it if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it or buy it cheap! Maybe if you're new to anime movies and you do not have much to go through, you'll enjoy it. It is certainly visually pleasing.
