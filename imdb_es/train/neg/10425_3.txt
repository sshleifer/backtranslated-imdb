This movie is great, of course, but only in the way it tells a BAD story. Stella is terribly raw, and she never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither does he learn better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her flashy dress and manners, but she can not understand that she just needs to mitigate everything. I do not think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up on herself, so her daughter can be associated with a group of intolerant snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see could have been normal for the times: people drinking a beer or two, enjoying a player's piano, dancing, but it's meant to be a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not have our son living like this!" Save me <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class can never aspire to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. And that's just a load of nonsense.
