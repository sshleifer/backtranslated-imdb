I already know that the critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names refer to other names, etc. Can be. I can not realize those things (I do not want to do anything anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in the "cinema". As for the film itself, it is again said that the film is intelligent and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything that we do not see in the monster movies, except the scene that takes place in an office in the second half. Yes, that scene says something about humanity, but it does not make the film brilliant. The film is entertaining (soft) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw in the movie, it's about visual effects. It was shocking, I could not recover for a while, because I expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira films, it was made in 2006, but it was not like that. It's as if you do not think there's a monster, you do not care. If you agree with me on this, I highly recommend Cloverfield which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. A dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is more of a drama than a thriller or an action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare The Host to other monster movies, but I try to say that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way, some people may call the film a masterpiece because of its sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but this is the fact.
