Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki Ardelean" comes too late. We already have enough of this and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Great directors should not have problems to see beyond their time, not behind. Why do people see Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We were born and we did not reincarnate, and nobody gives us any doubt about the old days. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers does not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian film, not the final song, priveghi! Maybe the younger directors should do the movement.
