Do you remember the good animated batman show of the 90s? The one that people praised? The one that people of all ages can appreciate? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of the Hulk in a bat suit? The one who had villains you could relate to? The one who had villains with real motives? <br /> <br /> Clearly, Warner Bros. no. Therefore, this dreck. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have you looked at a Batman comic before? Do you know that Batman is destined to be a "detective"? Gathering 2 tracks does not make you a detective! That makes you a monkey a little smart! <br /> <br /> This is the basic design for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Opening credits'. Batman finds the place where he is dead. Batman goes there and gets in trouble. Commercial. Batman finds an obvious / stupid way out of this. The penguin escapes. Penguin makes something obvious again. Batman continues. They do kung fu (by the way, and I mean that EVERYONE knows kung fu for some reason). Batman penguin punch. he is eliminated he goes to Arkham. (Note: it's usually a different villain in each episode) <br /> <br /> Well, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the floor, maybe it's in the old amusement park!" Yes, maybe, he was there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I already mentioned it, but ALL KNOW KUNG-FU! A PINGUNO! What do they think? (Probably because it's from the people who made that animated series by Jackie Chan). <br /> <br /> What is really annoying is that the program is just action. There is no intelligence. Any. If Batman needs to think, he will use the technology and then he will do kung fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget the villains. After all, what would Batman be without his gallery of rogues? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, I must say, congratulations on the originality. I do not think other Batman media would have imagined the prankster and a scared monkey man, a ridiculous as an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is a bit confusing when you think, is not your sexuality supposed to be ?) His main strength?) <br /> <br /> What is even more horrible, however, is that each character is now a stereotyped two-dimensional criminal. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a mad, power hungry scientist who is obsessed with bats for some inexplicable reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. With no reason. <br /> <br /> noticing a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting has to be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award? Did you win the episode 'Heart of Ice' by Batman: The Animated Series? The one who gave Mr. Freeze reasons for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics in its original story (mad scientist)? The one who made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman and Robin recognized that, using that as Mr. Freezes origin in that P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and turns Freeze into a jewel thief before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then freezes and gives him the power to cool things. . Then he continues to steal jewelry for no reason, while saying lines like "Have a ice day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they did see Batman and Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But hey, look on the bright side. This series does not make you feel anything for the villains, so it means you're a good person. Good for you.
