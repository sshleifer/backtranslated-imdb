One of those "coming of age" movies that should have nostalgia for adults and promise children. This movie has neither one nor the other. It's a bad excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body have fun with a fool Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly, since we're supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone to bury a dead woman in her front yard. Reflect vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie went on and on, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seducing Jennifer Love Hewitt while Howard Hesseman made us feel nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at the stupidity of other people, or to the committed performance of Ed Begley Jr., or to ask how Sylvia Kristel would look with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, get away from the films of Sylvia Kristel that are not Emmanuelle.
