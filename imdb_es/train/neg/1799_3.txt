Skippy, from "Family Ties," plays Eddie, a nasty 'metal' nerd who is chosen. When his favorite "metal" singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he launches a sibilant attack by knocking down all the posters on the wall of his room. But when he later obtains an unpublished record that contains the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. First he is absorbed by ideas of revenge, but then he does not want to take it as far as Sammi does. That is not really as far as its main victims seem to go to the hospital. This movie is absolutely ridiculous and has almost as much to do with real metal as "Rock Star". Okay, maybe a little more than that crap, but you understand my point. And how NO ONE can encourage a boy played by Skippy from "Family Ties", I have no idea. The cameo of Gene Simmons is fine, and Ozzy Osbourne achieves coherence, I applaud him for that, but otherwise, omit him. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards goes topless, a topless extra at a pool party
