The other night I saw Grendel and I am forced to prepare a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an untrustworthy, low-budget mini-epic, but it refused to allow me to change channels. It was amazingly, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched with fascination and horror the train crash from which you could not look away. I picked up a notebook and managed to capture part of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or just save your sanity. You have been warned <br /> <br /> - Just to finish, the warriors of Beowulf wore helmets with horns. Trivial problem compared to what came next. It also seems that the helmets were in a wastebasket and delivered to any actor who walked next. The fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed to make the film by Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circuses. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended not to feel ashamed as the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become king of the Danes just a few minutes before the film was released and he had not had the opportunity to change the size of the crown to fit him. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate the return of the actors At the tables waiting for their work of the day, it was not required to change their hairstyle. The variety of hair included braids, sideburns, haircuts and a red mullet, and at least served to distract from the dialogue. To demonstrate that it was a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to retain the accent they chose. <br /> <br /> - As is typical with this type of film (at least from Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case, it had a strange, ill-adjusted and new shape. <br /> <br /> - The love interest of women, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of hotties that should be observed with the volume lowered completely. <br /> <br /> - The involuntary focus of the film was a repeated crossbow composed of explosive beams. It never needed to be charged and even had a setback when it was fired. He managed to destroy the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical fact and the plot of suspense by itself. <br /> <br /> - The Hrothgar Palace, Heorot, instead of being a long Nordic corridor, was apparently designed and built by artisans who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf came to the homeland of the Danes on a two-masted ship with stern castles that was originally part of a set, the other two being Santa Maria and La Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth watched the approach of Beowulf's ship with a telescope. Before you could recover from that amazing innovation, you had to see the ship from your point of view. Judging by the angle, the prince was on an airplane of some kind. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (like in a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why the actors' breath can be seen, either inside or outside. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 2: Dancing of the Dark Ages in Denmark seems like a slow dance that I attended in the 8th grade. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 3: You can also make a catapult with an explosive controlled release air blast. But, do not expect it to really hurt anything. By the way, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II, shouting "Incoming!" to undo any remaining suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he could not leave any traces. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and her youngest daughter had not inherited her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br />: Grendel and mom chose to kill at random, fly away or drag their prey based on a careful reading. of the following pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Funny medical fact: being hit by a mythical beast strong enough to be thrown fifty feet against the stone causes slight facial scratches that do not bleed much. <br /> <br /> - The sword of the legend that Beowulf used to send to the Hag was as long as he was and would have contained enough steel to place a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the wobble dissipated any worries about his weight. <br /> <br /> - The best line of the film: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spat a liter of blood approximately six feet. Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said, "You'll be fine, my prince." So much for that job in the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> Now I feel better.
