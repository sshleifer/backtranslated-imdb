Pedante, too long manufacture that tries to narrate the birth of the Federal Office of Investigations. Begins quite promisingly, with an even relevant research on the explosion of an airplane, however, melodrama involving James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles just gets in the way (Miles had a habit of playing warm wives under coercion, and his shattered nerves arrive right here programmed). The esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy directed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the image does not leave a big impression. Murray Hamilton delivers the best performance as Stewart's partner, however, most of the dialogue is ridiculous and the stubborn pace makes the film look twice as long. * 1/2 of ****
