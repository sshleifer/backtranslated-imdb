Störtebeker is truly one of the worst mini TV series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is unbearable and the historical background is for the most part nonsense: just two examples: Visby was shown as a town of three houses. Instead, it was an important city at this time, the best days have passed. Second, Hamburg would never have been the city that cared for pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the main city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all that: The address! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single credible scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not repress laughter in the most severe scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent.
