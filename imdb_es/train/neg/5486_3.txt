First of all, this movie starts with a really silly note: a 10-year-old girl, playing in a moving vehicle, decides it would be funny to cover her mother's eyes with her hands, and then causes a horrible accident that kills the Mom ... duh ... I'm sorry, there's no 10-year-old kid so stupid. The rest of the movie does not improve much. After the death of the mother for the apparently most stupid 10 years on the planet, the father moves to the family to Genova, Italy, where he must teach at a local university, but here is the deciding factor: he does not speak at all. Italian word! Then, the girl has "visions" of mom (whom she killed) and, often, the later nocturnal terrors that always, always end when the father supports and pampers her. Then we are forced to see how this family is continually lost and then it is found and then it is embraced and then it is cried and lost and then it is found (followed, of course, by more hugs and crying) to the point that I was really looking forward to some kind of natural disaster just wiped out all these insipid and ignorant people on the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love Indian girls, but an indie about silly people (and I mean really silly) is just ridiculous and useless. It is really a pity that this film was based on characters so insipid that they wallowed in such delayed scenes, because the location was interesting.
