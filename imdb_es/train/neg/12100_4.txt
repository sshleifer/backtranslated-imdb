Now do not get me wrong If you need a perceptive summary of everything that has been wrong in the history of human civilization, as well as a perfect path to a brighter future for humanity, who to turn to better than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid and solid reasons why religion has survived is useful, then go to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for the love of God (?)! That is a good point in itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder that conveniently ignores how all of his society, art and science are rooted in him. <br /> <br /> In this film, it relies heavily on his keen ability of irony and cynicism. To make his point of view by trying to look scholarly and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but clearly it is not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, responds to the statement of an interviewee (and use the term freely, since clearly they were all "ambushed") that the existence of Jesus is a historical event with a deadlock "No, it is not" followed by a long look destined to transmit contempt to the naivete of the subject (an excessively nauseating device in this film). The problem is that the person was right and Maher was wrong in his claim that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers the historically suspect gospels. I suppose Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses flock to this pseudo-documentary just as they do the fiction works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will sound loud and loud (they certainly did in my presentation). <br /> <br /> However, it is doubly revealing that the strongest and most mule-like attack occurred during approximately 70% of the execution time that the film dedicated. anti-Christian diatribe while the audience was completely silent during the 10% sample dedicated to criticize the self-proclaimed Religion of Peace. Hmmm Either criticism of Islam is beyond the reach of the liberal and liberal target audience, or they were simply afraid to laugh. Very revealing, in any way ..
