I live in Ottawa where this movie was made and I really wish it had not been like that. This is a horrible movie of God. I really try to support independent films, but there is a stigma associated with any indie and that stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does not do anything to throw this curse. The actor, writer and director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, instead, he fills the clich√©s of past films. I'm really tired of the threatening evil characters that hide in the shadows and take advantage of the unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I can remember a particular scene near the end of the movie where the whole scene is illuminated with the headlights of the cars. Now, some may say that this was an effect used to create the mood and tension, but, unfortunately, it was to show the reduced budget of this movie. In addition to a film that dares to call itself horror, the viewer will find it difficult to find any real bleeding, apart from some scenes with corn syrup and red coloring. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that this film drags is the rhythm and the lack of development of the character, the basic plot is that the children are being kidnapped and the parents must locate this Bonesetter companion before some time determined to recover their children. It's not that this concept bothers me, but it really did not seem credible to me when the two main characters, both of whom have lost their children, can find time to kiss. This is done in such a short period of time that it is inconceivable, my first priority would be to recover my daughter and at least meet the lady before leaving with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is ... and I will not keep it against Kelly, but the movie was completely filmed in a boring and emotionless video, and that really takes away any tense moment that would just be oozed style in the movie. Although if this movie were given a million-dollar makeover and the story was remade, the performance boring and the lame, this movie could not be kept afloat. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel, which has been posted on his website, a sequel that was half-written in a single session. <br /> <br /> Lord, help us all.
