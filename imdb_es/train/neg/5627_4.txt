While watching this movie, it's interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men. The film devotes its time to showing how impotent the black man is most visible in it (except for a heroic moment). For much of the movie, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film are in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and friendly. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some three-dimensional and quite visible support characters that are light skin, and some white characters of certain warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are just invisible men. Shadows without a voice in the background, without consequences. Such a horrible failure, but anything less unusual in the mainstream media.
