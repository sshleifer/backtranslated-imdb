This movie was the worst I've seen. <br /> <br /> It does not seem to have a plot, but when you realize that this goes way beyond the beginning of the movie, then you have to look at the closing for a long time to recognize the director's total incompetence, too known as the lazy one who plays with the girl from the tampons in the movie, and we do not believe the Willem Dafoe in this movie, it's a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know from "Apocalypse Now" and "The Boon Dock Saints" , they never accepted such writing. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) the enemy closed this bill along with his twenty years less baby. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two screenwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the story); The widow meets the boy, the boy hits the widow, the widow breaks the windshield with the guy who hit her. <br /> <br /> Title in Holland; The black widow (different title, the same shit). <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!! It is a total waist of time !!!
