The mood of this movie is quite good and captures the feeling of the well of the 80s with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ... <br /> <br /> The script is executed by Mill, with the exception of a couple of comic moments, he appears as a stranger in what I guess he was meant to be nervous. The characters are totally dramatized and incredibly full of right-wing clich√©s that the screenwriter probably saw upon seeing a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie does not have a real story. It fulfills all the correct "artistic" boxes, but in reality nothing happens and in the end you are left wondering what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
