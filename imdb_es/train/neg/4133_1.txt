I saw this movie with some friends a couple of months ago, I still laugh today, thinking of some absolute stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I will not ruin anything for those who wish to see it, I would not want to ruin the laughter. It goes without saying that all the time I was watching this movie, I was trying to figure out exactly what meaning the characters in this movie had. However, towards the end, we all get bored, because the hilarity and the initial impact of a film to disappear at random. There is no plot and there is no decent performance trail. The characters are as developed as those in a "Learn to read" book in kindergarten. They even made a scene of lesbian sex not interesting.
