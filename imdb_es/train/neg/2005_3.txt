It's not that I was very surprised ... movies are never as good as the books from which they originated. I really wanted to see this movie because this is one of my favorite books, although I knew it would probably stink. I hoped to surprise you pleasantly. However, they deviated too much from the history of the book, and the film version did not reveal how horrible this house really was. The ending was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of a very bad cosmetic surgery. The performance was uncomplicated at best. Maybe if a theatrical version was created so that they did not have to stay in the "Made for TV" picture of Lifetime, it would be a better movie. If you saw this movie, I recommend that you look for the book and read it. I doubt you're disappointed and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
