I saw this movie for its two hours and I have no idea what it is about. Someone was killed or maybe they did not and maybe someone did it or maybe they did not. This brought back memories of the old days (bad old days?) When all Canadian CBC movies were smelly. Lately the stinkers have been the exception, but this confused mix of modern feminism, sudden flashbacks and mumbled dialogues makes up for lost time. I have never found the easy-to-read Margaret Atwood books. This film continues that fine Canadian tradition. It is not easy to see. Maybe the trendy people at the chi chi cocktails in Toronto will pretend that they liked it. We who are in the boonies are a little less pretentious.
