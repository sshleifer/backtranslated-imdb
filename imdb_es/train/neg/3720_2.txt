Is this movie a joke? It's a comedy? Surely it is not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is an intentional mood, but on several occasions the bad performance, the bad direction and the awful script caused the audience to laugh out loud at the movies. The plot is acceptable: a young and promising artist has just reached the peak of an assassin by entering by mistake. The murderer sees the portfolio of works of young artists that he takes and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. In the exhibition the murderer meets the sister of dead artists and they end up falling in love. Everything is very predictable and in the end there will be no one guessing as it is badly written. The film is mainly developed in Vienna and Austria, and shows how beautiful this city is. However, do not waste time in this movie, unless you are studying how NOT to act, direct or write a movie!
