I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the plot ridiculous. I understand that the fact that the main character's wife left him caused a mental breakdown, but it became so dull and boring that, after a while, I could have worried less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie went its course. Again and again the same ideas without anything new or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter became too long after Stuart started to open his wall to see what was behind him when the counter indicated there was something. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repetitive scenes with the steering wheel, and the confusing ones where he finds himself. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a failure when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie appears, read a book! You will be better.
