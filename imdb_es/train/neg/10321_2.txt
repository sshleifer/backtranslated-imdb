This show is terrible, all the jokes are terrible and they get worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a great Corner Gas fan, but at least I liked it at first until it became a routine around the second season, all the jokes had been played and the characters had nothing for them. Well, at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is usually a dull and boring CBC comedy that has nothing to do with episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am sincere, is not it? Or maybe only the people who really live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I do not know a single person who likes this program and can not stand it, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will not last much longer because all the success that this program has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise that this program is Muslim, that it is different and could / should have led to a great program.
