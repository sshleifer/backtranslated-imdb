When you get a British movie, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting, etc .; This movie does the business. It is made by highly qualified craftsmen. That alone can bring you a pleasant hour and a half. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you really do not find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocating for a liberal view of drugs, there really is nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In everything that refers to English, it is simply a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "complete Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea, apart from making money, of course.
