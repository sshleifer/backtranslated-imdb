I went in hoping that the movie was completely silly. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but making fun of the nonsense that happens in the singles halls was also fun. <br /> <br /> This said there were many things about The Singles Ward that were completely annoying. The whole movie was badly bent and made to look at her mouth while listening to her very irritating voices. This lack of professionalism was overcome only by the cameos of the Mormon celebrities who do not have any commercial performance. <br /> <br /> This film will have a good performance among Mormons, especially in the university communities where there are single people. However, the conclusion will offer no hope for the poor losers who are single. (Only beautiful girls get married in Singles Ward, the fat and ugly ones do not, but all the ugly men do) Ultimately, we realize that the whole movie was an ad for LDSSingles.com
