What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could have been run by anyone available outside the film school ... and in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would have put at least half a thought in the terrible script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a kind of wormhole and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (Panting!) Except this time, the monkeys writhe in a dialogue worthy of groans, absurd plots and striking special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could have been allocated to about 10 independent films that would have been considered "" Masterpiece "with this gut. <br /> <br /> As much as I enjoy the excellent acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as the leader of the evil monkey Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of stooping and breathing Fortunately for him, the makeup allows him, as an actor, to maintain a certain dignity and most of the false dialogue is hidden behind his moans and sighs. <br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, the always reliable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female wires and hooking them at the end without any kind of development or cause of relationship, and the "haha, we are so smart, are not we?" In this way Hollywood mixes the references of the original POTA to this. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night and call some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow' ', and to remember the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not shame or ridicule.
