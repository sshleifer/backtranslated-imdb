This movie should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a shame of the budget. <br /> <br /> Please, hire convincing actors and make a suitable film. Very thin plot, and little convincing lines. Almost hilarious, and that's a shame for an action movie ... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> They continue to reproduce the same "shots" of a Stealth plane flying away. You've seen it, and it was not worth repeating 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to pull out of film making. <br /> <br /> His films are getting poorer. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
