A question: Why? First, the premise is not funny or attractive at all. They use recorded interviews and take the audio to animate it with animals that speak the parts. First of all, to begin with, the interviews are not fun or entertaining, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be much more entertaining if we see them as they were originally, without turning them into cartoons. How does that add hilarity? I turned on CBS 'Monday night comedy list (which has become a regular way to relax after the stressful Monday business days) and I found this. Of course, the line-up of the comedy series would be repetitions anyway, being summer, but watching those episodes again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give "CC" a try. I really did it. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it will be fun. No And then he continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in full, and they had points for them. But no, they were only clips of a line, cut and glued very fast. It was like a horrible and terrible version of "Robot Chicken" by Cartoon Network. I was not a fan of the CBS canceled sitcom "The Class". While that was happening, it was a half hour of the lineup he would fight for. But if it's my turn to decide a full season of that or three more episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say I would take the "Class". Bearing in mind that a couple of hours have passed since it was aired, and I come here to see that I am the first to comment ... I think it's a good sign that nobody saw it and it will not last much longer. Cartoon roadkill.
