From everything I had read about the film, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessional. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a movie has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to reveal how the title relates to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I kept waiting for the background story of teenagers / young adults to develop, but never did. As someone who has gone through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would NOT have been a comfort to me the first time I went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
