Dakota (1988) was another of the first vehicles starring Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie is similar to the movie Harley. There are some differences but both are the same. I do not know which one came first. I suppose it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But both are "children" with problems that are trying to change their lives. Instead of bicycles this involves horses. They are basically the same movie and they are as cheesy as hell. If you are a serious L.D.P. Fan then I recommend that you look at both of them. You get some robberies and extreme postures of L.D.P. If you are in the game, do it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, with the exception of L.D.P. Amateurs !!!
