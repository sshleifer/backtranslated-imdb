I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman. I loved the evolution and who did not like the Ghostbusters? For the trailer, you know that Uma's character will be abandoned by Luke. So, obviously, the accumulation is towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him. But the reward is simply not there. The launch of the shark managed to get a (slight) giggle, but once again, everything was in the trailer. <br /> <br /> Nobody runs out of breath like Uma and Luke is on a diet with Owen on his good days. If it were not for Riann Wilson, you would sit there. with a constipated smile until your cheeks begin to cramp. This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, it just stays there like a stale cookie behind the refrigerator. This could have been such a brilliant broadcast of superhero films and feminism, but it fails in both aspects. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
