A fan dedicated to the TLK films, with the first as a milestone and the second probably the best sequel that Disney has produced, this movie ... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice work, music, but this is No more than a screwed Timon / Pumbaa in the TLK atmosphere. Although it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this movie is a big joke ... and that's all that saves it. Make a true TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
