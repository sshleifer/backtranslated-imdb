This movie was so badly written and directed that I slept 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the film are cheesy and although the plot is interesting in some angles, it is too far fetched and, in some points, ridiculous. If you are 11 years old or older, you will miss what you wrote in the movie and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or younger, this is a movie that will captivate your attention and surprise you with all the stunts (which I might add are wrong). made) And I wish you were some warrior for. The casting in this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was as if they were trying to increase the tension but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 is excellent, 1 is horrible) the performance in this film is a 4. Brenda Song has talent for comedy, but with this type of film, in some of the most serious scenes, her performance It was funny. When she made some of her "fight" poses, I started to laugh out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the direction, for example, the part where your enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain possesses, how his voice becomes dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid and how Wendy's teachers (Brenda Song) were all her teachers at the school who were possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous. So to summarize everything, a disappointing movie, but it's fine if you're 10 or younger.
