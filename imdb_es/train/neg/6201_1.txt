I have seen it. It's not "good" but it's interesting in a discreet way. The boys are quite naturalistic but ................ the final graphic / free scene of gang rape is disgusting and, oh yeah, the arbitrary insertion of images from World War II is offensive in the way he tries to compare the real horror with this misogynistic contraption. The real atrocity is real, this movie is simply atrocious. However, the film has an aspect that can attract you. But I think it's the "Emperor's New Clothes", but actually the other way around. The film looks good, but the direction, the story, the content and the final feeling that you take away from this movie are empty. If a feeling can be empty, that is all.
