Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this movie, but recently I had the opportunity. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting about Kamal Hans, what I saw was a lot of trash camera angles mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was except the degradism of Hinduism. I am more like many kinds of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a man of low character who has orchestrated this kind of thinking. I could have made a horror movie that this shit. He tried to add the Hollywood virus genre and God did not allow it, he did not make that guy a mutant and, ultimately, he would try to dominate the world. This is a very appropriate film for a film school in front of a regular audience. Pity him for not keeping the talent he has. The beginning of the story tried that Chaos borrowed the ideas of the Butterfly effect, then between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism (once again I insult more to Hinduism, but this movie has no equal and my insult is the same for the religion in general that could have made this intellectual film.
