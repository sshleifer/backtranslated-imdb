This movie seems to have been made by someone with some good ideas, but who had never made a film before and had not considered that a script should be edited or even fun. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and I assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. In its place, there was a stupid argument about mind control and so many flat moments without grace. And, to make matters worse, Candy pronounced some of the crudest lines I had heard so far. So, despite a potentially funny cast and idea of ​​history, we are left with a raw and amateur movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, although teenagers will probably find some laughter. It's really a shame, it could have been much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy, IT SHOULD have been wonderful.
