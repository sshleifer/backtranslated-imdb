There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American film experience. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on the establishment of friendly and intelligent characters. In regards to sympathy, the protagonists of Say Yes are a picturesque married couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let's count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you stay in when you leave. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing him to file assault charges. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother telling the police about the harasser and simply assume (for no apparent good reason) that the cops were bribed by him. <br /> <br /> 4. While trying to escape, leave your lady out of sight as much as possible to make sure the stalker kidnaps her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him personally. It does not make sense to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect a person to be immune to making some mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters of Say Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it is indeed impossible. so that the spectator worries about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. This kills the enjoyment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In case you were wondering, the writers did not stop with the silly characters. Since they themselves are probably stupid to write this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unreal that all sense of reality comes out the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Does the stalker kill a policeman inside a police station? while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. The harasser engages in all kinds of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, however, no one other than the married couple seems to notice their strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The scenes of "suspense" had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct scams of American movies. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is the beheading near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted on the wife. It's a pity that the filmmakers followed him with a stupidly scandalous ending that comes from the left field. <br /> <br /> In truth, the Koreans who are behind the creation of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should only move to California and seek employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
