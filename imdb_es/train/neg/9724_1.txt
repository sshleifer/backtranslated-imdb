Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed an all-time horror classic, "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre." Since then everything he has done has been horrible. This is probably the worst ... and that is saying a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (does anyone remember "Firestarter"?) It's a real disaster ... literally EVERYTHING is wrong! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), Asion script, loust production values, crappy special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! A must see ... it's not even good for laughter.
