I saw this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the presence of the great Dr. Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The movie is, simply, very bad. And no, not in Uwe Boll's usual way "so bad it's really entertaining", but just plain bad. The conspiracy refers to a man who leads a terrible life (due to criminal records, apparently), can not get a job and with a dreadful wife who cheats 900 pounds. This man addresses his uncle, a cult leader, in a plan to steal a truck of toys containing the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has designs on the theft of toys, and what follows is just under two hours of violence and sex completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (except Dave Foley, who really tries, despite everything)), the jokes never rise above the children who are shot in the chest in slow motion, and the people who take a poop. It's supposed to be a satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think "Plane!", But made by the creators of South Park and no jokes.
