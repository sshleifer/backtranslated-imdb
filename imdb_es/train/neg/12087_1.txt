I have seen all kinds of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh's was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier's was the best, indisputably. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's version of Bard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a dubbed version of a German television production of William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut. But if there is a slower version, more laborious, more lethargic and worse scenario somewhere, must have acted at the level of primary school. <br /> <br /> Having seen it in MST3K help, with Mike and the robots taking very good punches against the old boy, punching the depth of black and white television, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of the Germans representing a Play in English and make it look like a rejection of Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Better lines? "I'm going to unleash the Great Dane", "I do not think so, 'I breathe'", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey, Dad, would you help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, during a party: "Garrison Keillor is leaving Germany (YAAAY!)". <br /> <br /> But then there's Schell, who plays Shakespeare's best character as a mannequin from a department store, but not as expressive. There is no doubt that he is a great actor, but here he appears as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice". Did you ever see that? You have to see these two in a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is an instance in which it is true that you are much better reading the book. At least the book is not doubled by Ricardo Montalb√°n. <br /> <br /> A single star for this "Hamlet"; Ten stars, naturally, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good evening, prince not so sweet.
