Given the opportunity to write, direct and star in my own movie, I would probably choose something about robot women with weapons. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> This is a film in which, in one scene, a man crosses the road towards a yellow car that looks to the right, which suddenly turns into a pink automobile that looks to the left. This is a movie in which two characters have a conversation interspersed with photos of random people laughing and insects climbing the walls. This is a movie in which a man starts talking about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" just so that the actor of that particular movie suddenly shows up as himself (and then disappears). <br /> <br /> This is a film that decides to eliminate the need for a coherent plot directly from the window and use fifteen different editions while doing it, in addition to changing from black and white to color for seemingly without reason. However, I must congratulate Mr. Hopkins for his choice of actors in this film (some of which represent multiple characters). Everyone involved throws themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they are really doing. My favorite here was the Christian Slater hooligan with a hat that was impressively threatening as he babbled nonsense and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins has been quoted as saying that he made this movie a joke and that is possibly the best way to summarize "Slipstream". It is a joke for the public. You will see it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is happening and waiting for the answer to arrive, only to discover that the answer never does. As far as this particular joke goes, only Anthony Hopkins will know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch before and I'm a big fan of that particular director. I imagine that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as any of Lynch's films despite imitating many of his techniques (although I was surprised to find that nobody speaks upside down in "Slipstream"). It is too chaotic and random, as another critic pointed out, it is the film version of Alzheimer's disease. Without a doubt, there is a small number that can see this and get something out of it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to Hopkins involvement. <br /> <br /> Monitor at your own risk.
