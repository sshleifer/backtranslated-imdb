THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> While searching for a (literally, a ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) takes a hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells him two stories about zombies that eat meat and have a reputation for pursuing the area. <br /> <br /> An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hampered from the start by the painful performance of Haggerty in a key role, Worse yet, the two stories that make up most of the execution time are completely routine, made worse by indifferent performances and the lack of brightness of Brad Sykes, previously responsible for people like CAMP BLOOD (1999) .This is not a "funny" movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are "fun" (he, at least, believed in what what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite the lack of talent); Sykes' homemade lyrics are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtues, and most viewers will feel justifiedly angry and deceived by such unimaginative and ill-conceived trash. The 3-D format is completely lost here.
