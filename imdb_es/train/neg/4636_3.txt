The "Confidential" part was intended to elude the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the issue of organized crime was linked to the main research of Congress in Congress. However, despite the cast of the B-grade A film and some good script ideas, the film continues for about 73 minutes. It's a cheap jack production all the way. What is needed to compensate for poor production values ​​is something of imagination, especially from the uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few location shots in daylight, for example, would have helped alleviate the succession of sad study sets. An elegant helmsman like Anthony Mann could have done something with thick ear material, but Salkow treats it as an exercise more than a day's pay. It's a pity that Brian Keith's discreetly typical style does not work here, apparently just wooden and lethargic, at the same time that the cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. overlooks as a wild-eyed drunk. Clearly, Salkow is not the director of any actor. But, you have to give it to that brazen little Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic enthusiasm and dedication. Too bad, she was not in charge. My advice is to not do it, unless I'm ridiculous with the girls in the bar who do nothing more than return the whiskeys in the typical 1950s fashion with a straitjacket.
