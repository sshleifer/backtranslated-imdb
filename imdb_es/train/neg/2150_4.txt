You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad together again. Yes, that was the theme of the parents' trap in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But here's the creepy thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than Hayley Mills, 21, while playing the roles of loving daughters, Durbin seems much older, as in an adult. And so do all your supposed brothers. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in nice sailor outfits, but they look ridiculous in them, since the director seems to make an effort to point out his broad tips and stuffed animals throughout the film. So you are constantly divided between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others begin to "beat" them, you have the feeling that they are pedophiles, and you may be one of them, also to notice those rowers and tops that the director pointed out. Adolescents or tempters, little girls or sluts, are never quite sure what they are supposed to think of them as. <br /> <br /> Parents also seem very old and the whole movie seems very old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are up to date if you do not believe me.
