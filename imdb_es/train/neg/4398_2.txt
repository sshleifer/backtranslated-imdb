Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason to choose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regretted it! These two great actors are completely humiliated by making a series of irrelevant sketches, unimaginative and to the maximum (not that this is bad on its own) that are supposed to make people laugh, but they do not. The only reason I can think is that the director was his friend, and decided to support his film starring. I can not think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since then. I would recommend that you avoid this movie, unless you want to spoil your opinion about the two actors.
