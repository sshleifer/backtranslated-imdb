Since the beginning of this movie, you will soon realize that the name of the movie has nothing to do with the film itself, seeing a naked woman pursued by people with very silly masks to servants running with the worst clothes that I've seen. and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice before watching and, as the movie progresses slowly, you realize that the vampire is not a vampire, you must ask where the title comes from of some parts of the movie. A little bit of sense with Pierre and his father, but as the film comes to its really silly ending, you have to think why finish a movie this way and, by the way, had a better ending, though only out there, not It's a movie to watch basically.
