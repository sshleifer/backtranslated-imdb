A series of painful and ungraceful parodies that seem to last an eternity and a day. It is not as horrible as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that is by no means an endorsement in ANY way, sense or form. It has the worst clown that ever rhymes. Most, if not offensive to anyone but the most prudent or politically correct. It also has the worst parody of songs ever filmed, the personification of WORST Arnold EVER (not only the worst movie ever made, but the worst of them all). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would star in this (the reasons why I saw it in the first place) The only slightly amusing thing was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this film to ANYONE, but the people who are doing their mission in life to get this in Fund 250 of this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you live people. Also, if it is true that the Church of Science hates it, it can not be EVERYTHING bad. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
