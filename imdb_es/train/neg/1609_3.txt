The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che cares for too many indistinguishable wounds (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never reaches Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guessing what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che cares for too many indistinguishable wounds. <br /> <br /> When I realized that it was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew * anything *, but the title before it started), Naturally, I thought about the best epic of them all, Lawrence of Arabia, of David Lean. More of that later. <br /> <br /> Not being racist, but aside from what I have already mentioned, it is the fact that there are too many characters who are, indistinguishable, unknown Hispanic actors who look equally, especially considering that they all have beards " Che "and everyone wears Che's uniform. This means that the spectator can not identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). While del Toro is fantastic, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: not Alec Guinness, not Omar Sharif, not Anthony Quinn, etc. You have the idea <br /> <br /> Because the other characters are interchangeable, which results in a loss of reference. When Che's top advisors are killed, you do not feel remorse because you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I do not think it is a spoiler), there is no empathy on the part of the audience, they just killed him. <br /> <br /> It is too one-dimensional to relate to a human being. Apart from being a revolutionary and the second after Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married and has five children (he tells another character that is near the end). What was your motivation? A complete enigma. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh is purposely imitating Lean. Like Che from Soderbergh, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mysterious man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was insecure, that is, he had human qualities. Che is like a machine, as warm as The Terminator. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this year there was another war epic, Mongol. Che makes Mongol look like it's a wonderful life.
