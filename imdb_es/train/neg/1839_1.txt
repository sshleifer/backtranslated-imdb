I could not wait to put this movie on my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after I started it, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. Actually I saw the whole movie. My wife and I are still waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny happens. The box would be read as if it were really fun. The premise of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How can you miss this movie? Well ... miss! This is the unhappy "comedy" I've seen in my life. No one I talked to thought it was funny. It's just a really boring movie. Trust me. Avoid it ... Avoid it!
