Note that I have given this 1 star if the given option would have given me this zero. When I placed this DVD on my TV and sat on my couch, I expected something from the worst movie at its best. I searched for this movie in IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie, so I guess I was critical of every mistake. But he did not prepare me for the garbage I was about to spit from my TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this movie look good, well, at best. Do not let that fool you. This movie should be banned on all shelves in the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is like pornography, but without sex scenes. The performance (if you can call it that), the "plot" (so many holes should look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please, do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch it. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I'm thinking about it.
