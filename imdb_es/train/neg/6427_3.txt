So, together, I found this strange and really useless documentary. I know it has prizes and things, but personally I did not enjoy it too much. there was no humor or drama to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. Some of the people inside are quite different, which is not a bad thing, it just did not leave a good impression on me. This movie bored me completely, without offending my creative writing teacher. The theme of the circus throughout the movie was pretty good, but I did not understand it, and robotics and lion taming are definitely not my thing. The green animal thing was clean, I really liked the garden with lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four works connect? It just did not make much sense to me that someone made a movie about that. But if you like this kind of thing, you can enjoy it. Who am I to stand in your way? I'm just warning you about possible suffering.
