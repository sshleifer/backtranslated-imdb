I did not see such a fabulous IMDb rating, but I went to see it anyway, because I'm a big fan of Bible-related material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much like Indiana Jones' aspiring movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien had not seen those Jones movies (but should). I think he did his best, but the script just stunk. The music tried to be a bit Jones-like too. Great work, but for such a film it seemed like too much work, as if the part of the video did not deserve all that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was knocking it all down. The "jokes" are from the old school, somewhere in 20 years; They just brought a cynical smile to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, the SFX seems homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I love those stories), but things just did not work out in the end. Maybe I should put it on a piece of paper when it was still fresh in his head. When (in the first few minutes) I saw that the movie was going to be one of those "low budget movies", I was hoping that I would at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the films just disappoint.
