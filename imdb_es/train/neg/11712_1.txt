The only reason I remember this movie is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money that has been spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18. We were the age when action films were ours to enjoy more (ok, the second one). We left feeling so insulted, we wanted to get our money back, but the time could never be recovered. <br /> <br /> The editing is what killed this movie. As the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached to the film, it completely insults the public's intelligence by making these evil criminals in 4x4 VW Bugs fire rockets at the truck. Please, rockets in a truck known to carry plutonium? What's worse is that these VW manage to get 15-18 shots from a 4-rockets launcher. I would see in VW with 4 rockets firing 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last trailer, return a second later with two rockets attached, shoot another, then go in front of the truck and now it is back to the maximum set of 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We endure it waiting for a grand finale that never happened. It seems that they simply ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
