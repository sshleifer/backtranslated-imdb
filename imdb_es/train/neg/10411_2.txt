It is funny. I've seen a lot of Fassbinder movies and I've found that some are extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and unpleasant, like this movie. For me, it goes from great to garbage, without much in between. I know he has many admirers among the "sophisticated", but I can not help thinking that much of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get many negative grades for this), he made too many movies too fast and was too self-indulgent. His gay or gender films (like this one) tend to be very bad, badly done, sometimes quite boring (like QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and others just plain rude (like this movie). Could not your message about accepting a person's gender confusion be better than showing that he was hit or how the cows are slaughtered? Show some sensitivity for the subject and make your characters more human and understanding. Then, maybe, I'm interested in movies. <br /> <br /> Honestly, after seeing this movie, I am convinced that I could not bother with more Fassbinder films; the bad seems to be overtaking the good.
