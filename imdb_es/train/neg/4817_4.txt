When you're doing a thriller about witchcraft, I think you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend their disbelief for the movie to work. Some images ("Rosemary's baby", for example) have achieved this; others (like "Necromancy") have not done so and the potentially frightening material appears cheesy and ridiculous. This movie has some atmospheric moments, but almost half of the dialogue is difficult to understand (sometimes it is badly recorded, other times it is simply incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who has the best reputation, has a role that is so BENEATH that you have to assume I was desperate for work. Or maybe he was just having fun ... (* 1/2)
