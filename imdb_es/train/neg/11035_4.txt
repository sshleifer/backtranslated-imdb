This is the most saccharine romance I've seen. The perfect film for an idle housewife with handkerchief, housewife and high-heeled mules with ostrich decorations to watch in the afternoon, reclining on the couch eating chocolates. In fact, chocolates play a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see to the end, is that I was finally able to see the dreamy face of Keanu Reeves in almost every scene. . In most of his films, he moves too fast to see it well. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotion, more Italian than Mexican, really. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as rigid as wood. Unfortunately, the bodices were not torn, the hero is shamefully perfect and kind. The aristocratic clich√© of the warm-blooded old-world family is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish, Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew before the titles finished publishing that this would not be the movie I was expecting. The bright grapes seemed like the paragon of all the food advertisements in the Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his name on the list, but the art director was surely Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million-dollar canvases of the Irish cabins huddled in fuchsias. This movie was seen literally through pink lenses. If you like blue sky and dreamy pink, this movie is for you! (The chocolates looked really good, too!)
