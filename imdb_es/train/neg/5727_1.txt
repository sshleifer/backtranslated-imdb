I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I made on the network. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it really is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. After reading the interviews with the director, he says that he respects the constructive criticism, so I will try to avoid criticizing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions on why I found it so catastrophically terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know that the budget may not have allowed the big players, but with Nicholson working in the industry for more than ten years, he probably knew some actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly lame makeup and special effects. Once again, the budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended, but after working to compensate for so many years there really is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities with the hostel. While it is not exactly a scam, it does try to capitalize on the success of previous films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. It is not at all creepy or disturbing, not even annoying, just annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! In addition, the secondary plots on the theater and the type that comes to save them were weak and almost like a late occurrence. <br /> <br /> 6. The edition. WTF. That jarring, and not in a good way. Nuf said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (no doubt he frequents his IMDb pages). Because friend ... what were you thinking? Surely at some point, either during the filming or editing, you realized what a turkey yolu had in your hands ... Sorry, I do not want to be tough, but you must have more talent than this. I'm waiting for your next feature, the gutterball movie or wahtever. It is better, I hope the practice progresses. <br /> <br /> But meanwhile, avoid this as the plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I did not pay to see it).
