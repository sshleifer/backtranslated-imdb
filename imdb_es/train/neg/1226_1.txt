My, how the powerful have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she definitely had problems when she took on this role. This movie is bad for a particular reason: lapses in logic. It seems one of those movies that would have been passable with all its holes in the plot if they had left in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it seems stupid. This is the worst thriller I've seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The details of the story that Della (Kim Basinger) just obtained by buying gifts at a mall and being harassed by a gang of thugs who end up killing a police officer who came to her aid . Thereafter, she is chased by these idiots down an abandoned street and gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that are wrong with this movie. As I said, this movie jumps on the logic in every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the action is made for TV. Hell, this pseudo thriller is made for television. The way he kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian, and 1 African American who come together to stalk a Caucasian woman. Do not you love America?) It's ridiculous. The way he killed the Hispanic man made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main scion was so out in the left field that it made you shake your head in shame. I only recommend it to lovers of bad movies and nobody else. Any other person, especially Kim Basinger fans, would do well not to own this movie. You do not want to see an actress you respect in such a bad movie, right? Of course, no. You were warned
