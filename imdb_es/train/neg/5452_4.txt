As for the movies, this is quite nice. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I would have liked it if it had not irritated me enormously while observing the absolute lack of respect shown by the city in which it is located. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However, all the characters are English (with the exception of Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are fleetingly heard in low-profile jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes her "real life" movies to look more like real life) I really do not think she's hurt to use one of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or At least he got the Englishmen who could put together a decent accent! The futile attempt to use the word "wee" a few times did nothing but increase the insult.
