This movie is horrible. In the end, you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can not recover. The end of "turn" is very artificial. The development of the character leading to this ending is not consistent with his final actions in the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation, with the premise that the character of Rob Lowe will die on Christmas Eve, is literally explained in ninety seconds of "No, we were just fooling you". Then the character of Rob Lowe is not even upset about it! "I'll forgive you if you can forgive me," he's as annoyed as he is. If someone took weeks to convince me that he was about to die and then he would say: "No, I'm sorry, I'm just deceiving you", I would like to create a serious hell. I do not feel bad for giving away the spoiler because it could save some of you from observation. Please, save yourself and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
