This movie, although apparently a comedy, is extremely serious. Its subject is imperialism (with a capital I): how Britain, foolishly, humiliating, tries to convince itself that it remains a great power after the Second World War. At home, the Empire is run by friendly, benevolent friends who are so well educated that they can not distinguish close relatives; The Government Offices consist of forgotten files (an excavation in the Orwellian paranoia?), Inhabited by indolent rats, and rooms where the synabodies become bored, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, Britain clings to the old pomp; but the pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly, especially when embodied in clumsy twits. Carlton-Browne is an unsentimental image of decadence, without any of the tear-jerking rot that tarnished the supposed anti-imperialist jewel in the Crown. <br /> <br /> The film is also about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it is a dangerous Farce, whose participants deserve ridicule and contempt, not fear and respect. It is about how colonialism, characterized more by negligence than by tyranny, destroys the colonies that it abandons, depriving them of comfort, power and, what is more important, self-esteem, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> It's the seriousness, of course, that kills him. That does not mean that weight subjects can not be treated in comedy: The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian have proved it. In fact, it could be suggested that serious topics should only be treated with comedy, which allows a clearer vision. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that each situation must have a meaning beyond the merely comical. , to be overwhelmed and disintegrated. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy stems from the character's reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is too poor to maintain rich comic characterizations, and some of the best comedy talents ever assembled (Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier) are criminally squandered. <br /> <br /> Terry -Thomas, so sublime so often, shows that he could not handle lead parts, and that he needed to play mocking, arrogant, do not take off without brains. The music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its great irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on the screen. (To be fair, unlike most British comedies of the time, stagnant and poorly produced, the Boultings often try to express their points through the film, through montage and composition) Only Huntley manages to provoke genuine laughter , and that is rehearsing a character that could have played while he slept. <br /> <br /> None of the Boultings farces has gone well, they have never been thought enough. Although Carlton-Browne delights in the decline of the Empire, it also appears to be anti-democratic and militaristic. I'm sure this was not intentional, but these mistakes can happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and movie form.
