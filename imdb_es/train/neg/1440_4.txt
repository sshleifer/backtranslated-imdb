Swayze does not make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared with Stewart Granger; which grew up was my definitive hero in films like "Scaramouche" of 1952, "Prisoner of Zenda" of 1952 and "Mines of King Solomon" of 1950; Patrick Swayze fails completely. Even the portrait of a Major Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good in a great failure. In addition, Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the protagonist, and last but not least, the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for anyone to fill their (shoes). For someone who was disappointed by the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, I now strongly recommend it if you can not get the bigger version.
