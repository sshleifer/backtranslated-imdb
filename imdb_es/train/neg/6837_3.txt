Normally, I do not like revenge movies ... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than the typical premise of the plot of revenge. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic places (ie, Hong Kong), incredible battles with guns and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for an awesome unarmed combat. Like all revenge movies, you have villains you'd love to throw through a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has nothing of the sensationalist shit that drowns the plot and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes that invaded "Eye for an eye" and "Death wish 2". <br /> <br /> But in the The Double Impact parcels department is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mafia squad connected to a friend of the family with money problems or at least that's what he remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke in French accent is terrible. It was not the watery plot that made this film bad, but the use of clich√© lines and movements of other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. But still, Double Impact is still visible. But why do these shitty movies like this have villains (for example, the greedy Brit who killed Chad and Alex's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead) that you'd love to hate with the fiber of your being?
