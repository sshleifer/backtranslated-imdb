Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original episodes of Living Legend. The network took parts 1 and 2 of Living Legend and stuck them in a single plot with the horrible episode of Fire In Space. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 television series. Fire in Space, by itself, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, see Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the Renaissance Trek series, and you will see the difference in quality between science fiction produced on the web and distributed science fiction.
