This romantic adventure must have seemed surprisingly subversive in its day. A rich English woman of high class plans, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly antisocial type. There is an intelligent inversion of the sexual role, since its activities show that it is more daring and elegant than most of the male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep the love interest, and this evil lady does not back down when she meets the right man. <br /> <br /> The insipid weakness and credibility of all the other characters make the plot unconvincing, but those who thirst for romance will overlook it.
