Now, I will not deny that when I bought this on eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible work exhausted by the comedy master that I enjoy so much. However, I was soon going to disappoint. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I found it very difficult to see the Compleat Al. I have some smiles, of course, but most of the funny ones came from the music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically filler. You could say that this was not Al's biggest video achievement (that honor is for UHF). Honestly, I doubt this is going to make the jump to the DVD, so if you're a fan of Al Ultra and you have to own everything, buy the tape on eBay. Just do not pay too much for it.
