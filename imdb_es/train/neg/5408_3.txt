THIS REVIEW IS THE MAJORITY OF ALL SPOILERS. IF YOU PLAN TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. <br /> <br /> That is the problem with children's television today. It's all so condescending and patronizing. "Wow, that was fun, was not it?" No, it was not. And, unfortunately, it also seems to have penetrated children's movies. And that's what 'The flight of the reindeer' is about. It is true that I have not seen 'Flight of the Reindeer' in some years, so it could be confusing at some points, but I remember that I was not very impressed with that at that time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows A teacher who receives a book for Christmas. Now, the professor is an estimated scientist in the flight habits of some animals. I think it was the bull frogs. Anyway, through this book, Mr. Teacher / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs. Apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared at the North Pole. Now, if it were me, I would have thrown the book out the nearest window. Flying frogs are a natural phenomenon, but the flying reindeer is a fantastic and completely unreal concept. But, the professor is not me, so I guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and son at home without any idea of ​​where he left. Of course, things go wrong and before you know it, a flying reindeer has crashed into your private plane and is stranded at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? All right. <br /> <br /> Your family, of course, is devastated. I would be too, I mean, what a succulent Christmas. Elsewhere, the professor finds himself in a city hidden in the North Pole, inhabited by dwarves and a tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as he would have done, he greets everyone who is there with open arms. This hidden civilization of dwarf monsters, and greets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy They tell him the story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and that they spend the whole year making toys for children who have no idea. And Mr. Professor accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa Claus is, in fact, the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. There's only one problem: they do not want him to leave. The world can not know of its secret existence. After all, before they knew it, there would be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every corner. <br /> <br /> Are you still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, Mr. family, good boy. The book and suppose that it has gone to the North Pole. Boy, would not they be ashamed if they realized he had gone for a walk? Before the public knows it, they are going to spend Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, the professor gets tired of all the dwarfs and decides to leave. I can not remember exactly, but I do remember him holding Santa Claus at gunpoint. A fire fight ensues when the dwarves attack and he manages to escape through Santa's sleigh. With Santa Claus on his heels and with the thirst for blood in his eyes, Mr Whatever, through a wonderful coincidence, is flying next to the plane of his family who is looking for him. So he gets on his plane, the planes come back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is that there have been some shocking movies made in the name of Christmas over the years, but because they appear that festive charm they get away with. And it is that charm that is totally devoid of 'The flight of the reindeer'. There is not much evil in it; nothing that insults intelligence (well, obviously it exists, but it is a movie for children and therefore can get away with it) or something particularly offensive, but the problem is that there is nothing right about it either. It just does not feel Christmas. And for a movie that has to do with Christmas, it's a pretty big flaw. But, hey, do not I think the target audience of 'Flight of the Reindeer' thinks about that? Why should they? Everyone is so drugged with sedatives that they probably could not spell 'Christmas'. <br /> <br /> I give you three out of ten. If it was a television movie, then I would add two other stars. We all know how bad they can be.
