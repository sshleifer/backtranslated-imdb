I almost never comment on movies, but I saw the 5 enthusiastic reviews of this "movie" and decided that I had to comment with my own review. An instructor of mine received this film by mail, mixed with his Academy evaluators (AMPAS, also known as the guys who voted at the Oscars), and was so impressed with the terrible way in which this film was built that brought it to our class to show us how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot, the scenes are horribly edited, they are edited horribly (image techniques are often used in "24" false style images), and the performances (particularly the protagonist, who she even fails to act like a bad actress) are for the most part unpleasant. Someone did not really understand the point of an introduction, namely, the configuration of the plot. There is no configuration! Halfway through the movie, neither I nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was about. The first shot of the crane, which establishes some kind of murder, is never addressed, and now that I think about it, it was possibly going to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the movie as a flashback, but it cuts out of that scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on and on. At the very least, this film gives me renewed confidence in my own ability to make films.
