This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I gave up to see it after an hour and I regretted a lot of that time. The acting is horrible and there is almost no argument. My guess is that someone came up with a strange form of an animal and started making a story around it. Borrowing some ideas from films like Resident Evil and Aliens does not result in a movie like them. if this is going to be one of the best Korean movies, I would prefer not to bother watching even a trailer of a Korean movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, these movies are a good reason to believe that not necessarily a High rating means that the movie is promising. I think all Koreans who have internet for online games rated this movie compared to 8, although they have no idea what it is about.
