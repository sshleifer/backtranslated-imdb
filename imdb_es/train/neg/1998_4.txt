My roommate got the soundtrack for No, No, Nanette as dubbing on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non-stop. After they finally brainwashed me completely, I found that the songs were irresistible, especially the famous ones, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But, from the base of the soundtrack, I had no idea what the movie was about to. So the other day I saw a copy in the video store and rented what was supposed to be a lost version of the movie. I was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is very cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were not in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930 version of the musical, but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dance and, besides, the sound was really bad and you could not understand what people were saying. Long time Actually, the only highlights of this movie were the outrageous fashion of 1940. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this strange bag of feathers that she keeps on her front arm and then It is wrapped with this scarf. The unique dance sequence is also a bit odd, since Nanette does these weird ballet things with pictures of pin-up girls superimposed on top of her. Actually, a brighter point of the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a good artist, but is currently condemned to draw girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps the old school and dissuades Nanette when Nanette sells her masterpiece, the piece that made her career, for only $ 5250. Do not you realize that this piece was your immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with your bunny ears in your hat. When you will learn? Why do not you just smoke a cigarette before the advertisers take the Work?
