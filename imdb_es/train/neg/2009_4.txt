This is not a totally bad movie. The plot (the new house built next door seems to be delighted) is not bad, the mood is spooky enough and the acting is fine. The big problem I had was that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other programs), I could not see how different she looks with her new and big lips. I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on your face! They make her look completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim, the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (as Col) is also pretty good (but those lips!) As owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriately wooden. The different characters that live in the house were also fine. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move into the house. Unfortunately, the attempt to get involved in the neighborhood vibe fails, as the other neighbors are not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director could not make the "haunted" house particularly ominous. Other movies (like Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) achieve that creepy feeling, but it just does not happen here. The closest thing is when Col paints a representation of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the twist of the plot that happens with Kim, the architect. Initially, she seems to be a victim of the house like the others (she has left him without inspiration), but then she seems to have joined forces with her in evil. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a bad movie for horror fans if you can look away from those big lips!
