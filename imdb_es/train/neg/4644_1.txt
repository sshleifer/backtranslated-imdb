This movie is terrible. The story is about a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, going from Noir / thriller to the erotic, with horror elements thrown to a large extent. The film has a very confusing structure, for example, with the frequent use of flashbacks without linking them to the story. The plot is underdeveloped and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and what part they played. There are some implausibilities in many movies, but the scene where the main protagonist voluntarily accompanies a virtual stranger to his house, then agrees to go alone (to where he says he will find a phone), except the weapon she had brought with her. Calling the police, it was too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very poor: we were watching on a 42 "television, so anyone with a smaller game could find out what happened in the scenes taken in the almost complete darkness is beyond me. It is a chaotic disaster.
