This is a story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. The parents have been divorced and mom stays in the east of the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California and moves to Beverly Hills so his children can get the best possible education. <br /> <br /> Things become really fun when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The film is about the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the rich neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter plays a woman who wants Murray to move in with her because she wants a partner. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno arrive towards the end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; They are also the parents of Tomei. In front of the children, Reiner lets go of him reminding Murray that he has been paying the bills for them all the time. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a bitter note when the embarrassed family leaves their luxurious excavations and takes to walk through Beverly Hills in their car. I guess the movie is promoting independence and a little self-esteem.
