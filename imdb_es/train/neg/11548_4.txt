God, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this peculiar hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu that evolve around a treasure hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and a unique Italian company include comic narratives, events off the wall and some very tame T & A. The extravagant moments are being attended by the unpleasant wig of Lee Van Cleef, the psychopath with weapons of the Bible Yancey Hobbitt (that Juliano Ugarte, the man who should have made productions of European genres much darker than him), wants Ingenious dialogue, Hilarious background music and completely funny sound effects that accompany several small events (especially each jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this small piece of action falls on the territory of Turkey. It's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much and you will get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What's yours?
