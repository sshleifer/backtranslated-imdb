... it was to be able, in good conscience, to tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I could barely spend twenty minutes before I started thinking, "Wow, this is pretty bad." And, to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it were not for Esai Morales (although she had very little screen time). It's the only well-acted role in the movie, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. <br /> <br /> As I watched this, I began to remember his part in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it was not as good as I thought it was. Problem: his act in jail / hard man seems to be just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was making a very bad impression. Have you ever met someone who speaks as your character was SUPPOSED? I doubt it, but maybe I should have. <br /> <br /> And, to make matters worse, they've managed to inject some prison philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived, especially when you consider that the "rhetoric" was being cast. for a "rasta" whose accent was so strong that it did not seem natural. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not criticize a movie like this, but when I saw the movie I had quite a favorable review. I felt like I had been cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
