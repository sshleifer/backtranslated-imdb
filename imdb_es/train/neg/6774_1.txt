As an avid Cary Grant fan, I expected to see this movie and howl with laughter, as AMC called it comedy. I've never been more disappointed with a movie! The usual charm of Cary and the effortless comedy are AWOL of this whole movie; He looks tense, bored, and not just himself. Mississip's character is among one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen: her accent is terribly exaggerated (and wrong, according to the part of Mississippi she claims to have come from), and each time she makes a line, it's several decibels more higher than any other. another cast member. Mississip tried to stand out in the movie as an adorable foolish fool, but in the end, only manages to detract from the already weak plot. Mansfield is more like an inflatable doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and although she was never known in Hollywood for her ability to act, this movie screams that she never had that ability to start. The character of Ray Walston was sugary and was finally devised. For the four men who have gone ashore, it was the cleanest I have ever seen. I watched this nightmare until the end, and although I will not spoil it for anyone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd thing you've ever seen. The film tries to provoke patriotism and a feeling of debt with the combatants, but the film loses that point completely due to its weak plot and its weak distribution. I'm sorry, Cary!
