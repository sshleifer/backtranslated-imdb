First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this movie is like my summary. The biggest trash bag of all time. At first, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who gets scared onstage at a Comedy Building called Apollo. On his way home from a concert, while riding his BIKE, go to this woman who likes and is hit by a truck. Soon after, choose the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then, he dresses like the Outkast music group while trying to reproduce the original scene, where he comes out as Jockey. Second, he returns to Apollo and tries to be the comedian who tried to be in his previous body, begins to dissuade the white population and tries to be black. Do you have my drift? This movie is horrible, it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process it goes out like a garbage bag. Just follow my advice, do not even see this movie.
