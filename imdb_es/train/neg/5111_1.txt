I used to be an avid spectator until I personally spent long cold hours helping to build a home for the White Family, just to get sick and see the home a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscapes were eliminated, the beautiful rock sidewalk and the front fountain were removed, all the pines and pecans were cut in the front, the sprinkler system was started. Now it looks like a disaster area. They no longer live there ... they live "in the city" and leave only for the weekend. It makes me sick to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and see the result. The story we all saw on television was not completely true ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
