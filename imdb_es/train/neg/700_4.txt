I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to overcome the 74 famous videos that were banned in Britain. This was initially banned and relaunched in 2001 with a full 10-second cut. <br /> <br /> Some university students spend their Christmas holidays preparing a bedroom for renovation. There are some spooky characters who roam along with the four children. Which one is the slasher? The actual murders are not very bloody, so this nasty video is not really unpleasant. There is a requirement for flashing the pikemen, but it has nothing to do with the university students. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and it turned out that he was right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The final turn was smart; I have to give credit to the writers for that originality.
