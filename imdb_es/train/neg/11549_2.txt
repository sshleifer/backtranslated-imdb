Although there were some funny moments, I thought the movie was pretty boring. The more he ran, the worse he got. Once the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself observing the magnificent outcrops rather than the increasingly foolish and unconvincing interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First, she is in the deal, then discovers the truth and she abandons. Then she is back again, then she leaves them again. Then she is back again. There is no apparent motivation for any of your decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many lost possibilities. I would have to say that the images were much less than the sum of their parts. Apparently, people who liked Repo Man liked this one. Searchers 2.0 is no match for The Searchers.
