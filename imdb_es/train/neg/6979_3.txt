I also saw this movie, and although it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and I would not recommend it to women who have small children. The terror on this mother's face when she sees her daughter about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is that internally she dies. Finally, she returns to the mountains of the Aplacians. All the money in the world that she earns when making dolls does not hide the pain she has. I remember his desperate face as he takes money out of his clothes to try to get his son cured. I am surprised that this film takes place in Detroit, because when I saw it I thought with certainty that people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a route for the poor of the mountains.
