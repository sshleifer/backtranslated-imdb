No plot, shit acting and gore nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Is this supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear, or suspense, only BOOM BANG GORE, then done. Some marines are in the desert for some strange and horrible reason, and they are hunted by those mutated beasts of the first movie, which was good, and they should have left it that way. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money and the use of senseless violence, like the sequels of "Saw". They know that no matter how useless the plot is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. I miss good suspense horror movies. We go Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
