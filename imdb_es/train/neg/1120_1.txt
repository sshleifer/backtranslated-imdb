I saw this movie in my international film class and they took me out of there. This movie is nothing more than a scene of obvious shock value after the next. <br /> <br /> The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his pending danger. He meets a woman named Christine when he lectures at a local book club, and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To make it easier, Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So Reve devises a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so that he can finally have sex with him. But then it was discovered that Christine had had 3 previous husbands, whom she had murdered. Now, the boyfriend of Reve and Christine could be "THE 4th MAN". The plot makes sense without plots. The editing and everything technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is disgusting and I felt the need to vomit in some places. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Reve leaving the bed alone with a T-shirt. So from the beginning, you can see how Reve's charming little pecker staggers as he walks through his small apartment in a hangover state. Later, he has a dream where his penis is cut with scissors, and show it along with the source of blood that follows. Reve caresses a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. In addition there is a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined. <br /> <br /> It's not like I have something against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is so brazen when it comes to shocking. The whole movie revolves around the value of the shock. <br /> <br /> So, if any of this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far, far away from this. My mind is still marked.
