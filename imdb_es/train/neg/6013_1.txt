I have read all the books to date in the Left Behind series, and the film does not do justice to any of them. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good episode of MST3K. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt as if the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them. The characters were rigid and unpleasant. The effects were cheesy, and they looked terribly false. The end was horrible. First, he did not even go through the entire first book. Second, it did not make sense. If you had not read the book, you would have no idea what was happening. It must have been the most corny and cinematic ending I've seen in a movie. I'm angry because I paid money for this movie. If by some miracle a total liberation is obtained, they should review it totally and let Hollywood take charge. Those two aspiring film producers and the aspiring director should leave the creation of films to professionals.
