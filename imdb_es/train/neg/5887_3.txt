Jane Russell proved to be a charming musical comedian and comedian in the similar title of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? but unfortunately, this movie wastes those skills. There's a budget and a nice picture of Paris, but the movie just does not work. Mrs. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. That does not let anyone play Jane Russell properly. Some of the other players are out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; Above all, be careful: there is a musical number in which the African cannibals with the hollow head "cook" the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Knights Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
