I could not believe what I saw once I saw this movie. Nor does it make sense, then, blood and violence. Unlike other horror movies that had gore and a meaning, this movie is just blood, gore and killing one after another. This movie is not interesting at all, it does not have a plot or significant argument, nor does it have an intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie in general does not make sense. Do not even waste your time with that. It's just an hour or two of senseless violence. It has many bloody scenes that do not scare but simply rebel. This is probably the worst horror movie I've seen of all the horror movies I've seen.
