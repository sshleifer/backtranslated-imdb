Slaughter High is intrinsically your iconic movie from the 80s. A joke comes out of the hands leaving a horribly burned geek boy. A few years later, the geek boy returns and begins to kill the people who hurt him. Now, the story may sound intriguing and very entertaining, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the movies of the 80s is that it has some faults without humor and continuation errors. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, However, it is not really as bad as you might suspect. Although it does not help, all the characters in the movie are so dirty and unpleasant. The protagonist, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is easily the greatest tormentor of all and she is the one that supposedly we must share compassion and root. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think even the stereotyped geeks themselves would be crazily rude and simply antagonized by how geeky he is, so when he's maimed, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of involuntary laughing potential. Munro's lack of talent for acting is quite apparent, which puts her at the same level as the rest of the horrible cast. However, the biggest fun is easily when the movie tries badly to pose Munro, who is about 30 years old at the time, as a teenager among a cast of teenagers. And then, when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around his real age, the rest of the cast does not pass as adults. All this goes well with a theme song that is a funny pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a voice that screams "I'll catch you". With that said, Slaughter High really is not a very good slasher movie, but it has a pretty bad entertainment value. Maybe it's essential for hardcore fans, but do not expect dilemmas, suspense or credibility from them. Horrible!!!
