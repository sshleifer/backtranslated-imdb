I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be another failure of the combination of Western and Asian arts. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after a tireless emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some may simply be fed up with them. The excessive cherry blossom, frankly, exaggerated. It is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the flashy type, since a truly beautiful geisha would not be the most westernized pumpkin of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have correctly mentioned the biggest failures. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any kind of role when it suits him / her. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions that he showed in this film had not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, did not even look like a Japanese. Some comments have mentioned the peculiar, delicate and feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with whom I can not agree more. They are so delicate that I guess not even all the modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles of Geisha, let alone the two Chinese actresses and a Malay who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know so much Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good opportunity to awaken the curiosity of American audiences. But it would be an insult to the film itself and to art if the film wins the Oscar for best costume, best director or best film.
