A wrapped monster resurrected goes in a murderous drunkenness. A lunatic is seeking revenge against the living members of a previous expedition. Universal seems to be running out of wrap, as well as new ideas. Most of the budget was spent on Lon Chaney Jr. to play Kharis, the Mummy. <br /> <br /> Other players include George Zucco, Wallace Ford, Turhan Bey, Dick Foran and Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> How much longer can this madness continue?
