It really is a terrible trick of a movie. Its 70 minutes are very well padded with archival images. The rest are exterior without descriptions and interior scenes turned off. The exhibition of the plot is very badly represented. All of them are just dirty scenes, something like together. There is no attempt at drama in the selection of scenes, but the drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please, do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot refers to a rocket that radiates a million degrees of heat that orbits around the earth five miles and threatens to destroy the earth. It is a real-time threat that must be diverted if a custom made H-bomb can be designed and placed on an experimental rocket within one hour. There is not much to report here, except a crazy speech from a scientist against the project, since there could be some kind of life on board and think about the scientific possibilities, but this speech made by the obligatory liberal idiot was quite outdated by then. <Br /> <br /> What this film keeps, in a somewhat unique way, IS the archival material. I have never seen a larger selection of fighter aircraft in the fifties in any other film. This is by no means a complete list, but only some of the planes I managed to see. There is a brief interception of a pilot flying, in alternative shots, a Scorpion F-89 and an F-86. The first to mix interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or the Canadian CF-13) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> Then, for some reason, you see that B-52, B-47 and even B36 are taking off. More stuffing <br /> <br /> "These Canadian planes move at 1200 miles per hour." I do not think so, since one of them seems to be a Gloster Meteor from the era of World War II, the rest F-80. The Meteors press the attack and one becomes a late F-84F with a flight of the first F-84 straight wing attack in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that does not. They seem to be the type of training T-33 but a kind of interim variant interim for all weather with a radar in the nose. These are scrambled in a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters. Launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Rangers and A-3 Skywarriors. The Air Force scrambles the F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've never seen in your life, as well as the Super Sabers F-100 and Delta Delta Darts F-102. <br /> <br /> The F-100s press its attack with so much padding. The F-89s unload their rockets into their pods from the tip of the wing in slow motion. The F-86's fire, an F-102 releases a Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With loose-wing rockets. There is a very strange image of a late F-84 model (prototype?) With an early F-85 straight wing model on top of it, obviously, a manufacturer's advertising movie (Republic Aviation) that shows the differences between the old and the old. the new. Improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. The way he got here is something anyone could guess. <br /> <br /> There are other great images of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a large place on the highway and especially wonderful images of the New York City's Times. Plaza during one of the civil defense exercises in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the automatic pursuit that was go to the end of the image, since the Pacific seems to be in the background. The use of a Jupiter Jupiter is a bit mind-boggling and there is also a good TR 3 to be seen. Canada must have been cheap and used a lot for free in the background. <br /> <br /> As for the actual narrative of the film, there is little more to recommend than the mystery of who Ellen Parker is. Giving the finger at the end of the image. And she is definitely cheating on someone. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before this movie premieres? Was your career like this your last credit? <br /> <br /> It's as if the newspaper in which the gift arrived was more valuable than the gift.
