I got this in the 10 CURSE OF THE DEAD DVD package. You have to love those bargain packages. Even if they do not have true remastering, restoration and everything that hoo-ha, and movies are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always some gems included. And for "gems", I mean there's always a good shit to see, especially if the movies are from the 70's like The Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion de la Locura, but when the title screens roll, it's the torture cell of Dr. Tarr's Dr. Tarr. It really does not matter, since shit is shit, shit is, right? Yes! But to say that this movie is completely worthless is not true at all. There are some extravagant elements here and there, and obviously the movie had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the opening title is great with its negative color in a cheap TV aspect. The dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver leaves to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. "WHAT STRENGTH!" says our hero It's funny, then, that this guy later can not fight the crazy lumbermen when they come to make fun of him. You will completely forget that this guy was in the movie until he reappears later, near the end. So memorable are these characters. <br /> <br /> The best part of Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the extravagant music and screw ball games that the good guys have to endure. It's like bad cartoon music that would be nice to a three-year-old child. And why all the weirdos, anyway? I would say that my favorite moment had to be when the horse and the buggy are ambushed by the forest monsters when they attract a stupid homemade ghost by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. What the hell? Oh, yes, there are also many boobies to be seen, for those of you who dig such things. Piqueros, bad dialogue and crazy music. What better Mansion of Madness sums for me. It is worth at least one visit, and it can be much better if you have drunk a few or not. I can not say that I ever got bored when I saw it, but I can not deny that it is also a barrel of poop. Something like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot, but no. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
