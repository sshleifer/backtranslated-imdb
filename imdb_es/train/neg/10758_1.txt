This is probably the most boring, worst and useless movie I've seen last year. The plot that was destined to have some philosophical aspects came to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with many clich√©s: the solitary, handsome, psychologically disturbed wolf policeman, sleeping with his gun ... + good worker and shy, but good looking, scientific, add a plot of 2 cents and you have me, Robot! I felt terribly disturbed by the obvious publicity of brands like FedEx, Audi, converse, etc. This movie reeks of commercialization and tends to be more of a poor ad that unfortunately will not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy, if you have free time, instead watch a good television show or, better, read a good book.
