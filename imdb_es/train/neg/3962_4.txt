I really wanted to see Nana after seeing Renoir's amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered her best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately this felt like a big step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. His performance is exaggerated, even for a silent movie. Her performance is more similar to what one would expect in a film from the first years of adolescence, not in the late 1920s. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains . It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall into this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about it at all. <br /> <br /> The film was also quite long, the camera work was not interesting (apart from a picture of a horse race) and the editing was boring. History reminded me of Pabra's Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's Box simply scores at all levels where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is only for Renoir finalists or for fans of very serious silent films.
