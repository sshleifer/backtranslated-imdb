There are some things that I can never understand. Like this movie. What would happen if I created a model of polygon crocodile and Dino really very cheap and of poor quality in Maya and then proceeded to cut it and paste it in an amateur video clip with people who shout and eat the same? How can anyone even believe that a completely false CGI dinocroc that seems completely out of place, would influence the events of this movie? I know that your B-grade, low budget and all but producers could do better than make a piece of shit that no one will see or feel. It just does not make sense. Are people really stupid enough to sit through this? Supossely Yes. For laughs? No, it's not even worth laughing at this.
