* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am sure that when it was launched in 1958 it was very appropriate for its time. Back then, movies had a slower pace to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story. Here, a man moves into a house owned by his last wife who died mysteriously with his new wife. The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) is really an unappreciated character. Get a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble, since she knew there was a dirty game in the death of the first wife. She can not tell Jenni directly what happened, so she tries to scare her with her skull. Jenni, we also discovered, saw her parents die, which caused a life of mental anguish that led to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I found that the pace was a bit too slow for my liking. But if you like slow horror without much blood, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
