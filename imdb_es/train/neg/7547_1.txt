Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, do you understand? That is called the senseless omen. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Eh? (On the way) Basket: Here is your doll, little one. You really should not be so careless with your belongings. <br /> <br /> Girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Crackle?? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What?? ? (Open letter of tears.) Wow! The writing of my ex girl has really improved. And look, his missing daughter looks a lot like the girl with the doll that I was accidentally responsible for getting killed, somehow. And she has my hair type. I wonder, should I torture myself and go look for her? Let's see what my friends in the precinct think. <br /> <br /> The other police man of Basket: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH <br /> <br /> Crone called a tree: although it is not his daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you do that? Tavern girl with big bones and tree name: Eh? Basket: (breaks a bee) Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Actress who was once promising and pretty playing a lusty waitress in taverns: that's good. However, Honey is not a plant. <br /> <br /> (Towards the green) Willow: Ah, yes, and I forgot that you are the father, my son, Conan, I mean, Rowen. (Yawning.) I could have stayed and had a life with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a princess of the hive, instead. I mean, it does not matter. (Nods, wakes up, widens eyes to anime proportions). Mwah, kiss-kiss. I love you! What were we talking about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Smell. Flicker. Why. Are. Your. Shouting. A. Me? Is it because I stole your Vicodin? Smell. Snore. What were we talking about? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips ache. <br /> <br /> (In the classroom) Rose: What is man? Unappealling twins, in unison: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Get away from the bicycle. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (In the hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh annoying. Silly old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> (In the Queen Bee mansion) Sister Summersisle: You have a lot of potential. What are you doing here? You were not the stallion Cher slapped on Moonstruck? (Licks lips.) Basket: I was about to ask you the same thing. Where is the girl Sister Summersisle: How are you still flying? Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous "s". Basket: Be careful with that semi-trailer towards us! Aaaaah! Oh No matter. Dammit! (Pops another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine <br /> <br /> (Back in the tavern) Big and extravagant tavern dick: I've tried with Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I've still raised the size of a bear outfit since last year. <br /> <br /> Crone with tree name: HAHAHA. All the best for roasting that meddlesome cop, dear. <br /> <br /> Great boned wench: Totally. <br /> <br /> Basket: That was the last straw that broke the basket! Take that, girl! (He drools her.) (Edward Basket is attacked mysteriously from behind) Girl from a voluptuous tavern: EEEE! Buck up! Leave the island and take me with you! Do I have to approach you or what? Get out of that, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take that, girl! (Gives him a courageous kick in the face, his eyes spin back in his head and turn into Xs cartoons.) Voluptuous girl: Snoring? (In the roast of Nicolas Cage) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basket's cell phone rings in the middle of the scene of his bear suit and then the call is interrupted? It's like a wireless ad: Help me! can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: Do you remember when I took out the bullets that I took from Basket's weapon? He seemed so surprised. You should be more careful with your belongings, Nick. Hahaha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> Everyone: The drone must die! Basket: (screaming) Oh, yes, bitches? Well, roasting is not going to help your damn honey! Aaah My legs! Honey, (honey, you understand?) Lower the torch and get away from the basket case. Honey! Smokey bear says do not play with matches. Hahaha. What??? Be careful with that semi-trailer at full speed! Ahh Oh Damn, these flashbacks of my drug experimentation phase in the seventies are getting old! Where is my heroine? Oh. Oh. My watch is not fireproof. Oh. I think something bad is about to happen. can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close-up. Dammit! (Six months later) A voluptuous woman in today's slutty outfit: I told that Basket case she was taking me with him. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drone: I like to help people. <br /> <br /> Voluptuous girl: Then take me out of my contract for the sequel! I think something bad is about to happen. EEEEE!
