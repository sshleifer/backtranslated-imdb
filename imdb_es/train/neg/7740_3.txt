This movie really manages to be a meaningless enjoyment for 2/3 of the trip. Unfortunately, the film ends up being too 'confused'. While I know that some of the elements of the plot are standard in the films of "friends police", I was attracted to the characters that frustrated each other, but in the end the film is based too much on persecution sequences as a crutch and I lost interest . <Br /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters to be alone and doing their thing, and we were able to see who they are and identify with both cops from the beginning. We form our own opinion instead of being forced to see them through constant fights. <br /> <br /> In the end, there are too many things at stake and that much remains to what could have been a nice piece of escapism. . This is what worries Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate business 2. His relationship with a radio psychic 3. He is being investigated for matters internal 4. Homicide investigation <br /> <br /> If you add Casey's concerns, you want to be an actor and get revenge. the death of his father Now, some of these things come together and even come together well, but all the elements of the plot come together in the middle of this false persecution that is so long and pathetic that I barely have time to break my boredom and give Shit about what just happened. The impressive stunts of the writers can not overcome the bad movies. <br /> <br /> As if a ridiculous chase sequence was not bad enough, one that has four separate sections and could last about half an hour, was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan receives information about his estate contract roots while chasing the author with a weapon. All these frames and extracurricular jokes have no meaning to me, whether the criminal is caught or not. We either forget or do not care about the murder plot at this moment because several lines of plot and the sweet eyes of the persecutions have numbed us beyond understanding. <br /> <br /> Although I could continue with the persecutions and how they ruin a decent story, I will not. This could have been a very nice formula movie, but it became too big for your problems and it became a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did quite well and it's worth noting a little appearance by Gladys Knight. Unfortunately, none of the actors can prevent this misguided film from being forgotten. <br /> <br /> While this is probably better than the likes of "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II," they still do not do this. good movie Once I heard that Harrison Ford claimed that he only made movies that he thought would make money, I'm not sure if that's true or not. What is certain is that to get a big box office you do not need a great movie or a great actor, this movie does not have any of its main roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stick with Indiana Jones because at least he can still run.
