This could be the worst movie ever made and it may be worth watching for that reason alone. Streisand is incredibly amazing as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortuous, and Barbara presents some of the weakest shots ever filmed. And I do not even mean the plot. Actually, you will get more laughter from this movie than many comedies because it is incredibly terrible. The unbridled ego of Streisand, thinking that somehow it could raise this bad smell to the heights of the Oscars, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a car accident in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of "The Sound of Music" played backwards on an old turntable. It is really so bad. I'm surprised that someone from Streisand has enjoyed this movie at the level it was intended for.
