If it were not for the bad dialogues and the script. I mean, the management was really in touch with your subject. The actors did well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, what was really missing was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I highly recommend not seeing this. Unless you're an Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and I'll see everything he's playing. Even if the result lately is pretty bad. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
