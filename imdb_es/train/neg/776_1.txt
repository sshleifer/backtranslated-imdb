I remember seeing this caricature when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather picked up the video for free at the mall. I remember that it really stunk. The plot did not make sense. I hated the fox who became Casper's friend. It was so stupid! Casper burst into tears if he could not find a friend. And that? Get over! The only good thing and I do not want to sound mean was when the fox was shot and died at the end. I laughed with my head because this caricature smelled a lot. The bad news is that the fox is resurrected and becomes a ghost. I wish he had stayed dead. I think I even gave the video of this to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offered it for free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let them see this. You will probably agree with me that it sucks.
