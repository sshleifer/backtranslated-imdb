I've seen every episode of this spin off. I thought that the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such success that is Gray's Anatomy. So I kept looking. I am afraid that the second season lacks charm, chemistry and, more importantly, the drama of its predecessor, Gray's Anatomy. The relationships seem designed and the performance is regular. The writing lacks the intelligence and comedy advice seen in GA. There are demonstrations of a formula, but it does not feel formulated and invented, unfortunately the PP is not like that. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid that Kate Walsh's life in Los Angeles is simply not interesting.
