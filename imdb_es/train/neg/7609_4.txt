Being a big fan of Corman's horror films, he expected a little more from his western than he received. Well, I was entertained well. I almost laughed as much as seeing the Blazing Saddles by Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> See the show of mobile tire tracks in the old west prairie. You can kill time by telling them if there is a boring scene. And horses also seem to have gears, considered fast-forward pursuits. See also the queens of the swinging bar room of the traditional Wild West Saloon making a number that recalls a certain fashionable dance of the 1920s, here decades before the style was invented. I hope the room around them does not wrinkle. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really good. A special compliment for them to do the best they could with the material that seems to have been taken from 'Johnny Guitar', but that does not impress in the same way. But there really is nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Like an old and very bad horror movie, it can fail in a way but it can give joy anyway. That's one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me and that's why I dare to recommend that you watch this movie if you have the opportunity.
