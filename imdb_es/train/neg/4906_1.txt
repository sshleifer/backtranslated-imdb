Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously, this was done for the television movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but anything before or after that seemed to be a painting by the number of films. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry among the lovebird detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I'd like to dig deeper, but this movie really does not deserve it. Grade: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
