Deep SH .. is more like that! The eels are drawn in the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very sticky <br /> <br /> Without development of character or relationship. Called "romantic" scenes very cheesy and predictable. An interesting idea, but a badly written script and the special effects of LOUSY make this a must see.
