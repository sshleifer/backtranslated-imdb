I am surprised by the number of voters that even give this film better marks. My thinking about this movie was that the target audience is adult and male. Women whipped and tortured, ruthless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients, introduced into the history of cinema by the subgenre spaghetti. The opening and crushing of hands are DJANGO scams. However, THE SHOOTER lacks the style of, for example, DJANGO. The score, the acting and the cinematography are, at best, mediocre, but if you look for the ingredients mentioned above, you are in the right place here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
