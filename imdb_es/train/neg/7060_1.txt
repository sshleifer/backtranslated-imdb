this movie is terrible The characters are completely incredible and extremely inconsistent. The plot is horrible and some of the scenes in the classroom are extremely valuable and uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality of the script and the characterization suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the absolute lack of credibility in the school environment suggests that, in fact, the writers probably never were to high school. The performance in most cases was also weak, although much of this was due to a deficient script and plot, I'm not sure any actor could have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Having said the sound The track was fine, and the cinematography was nice in some places (although the editing was bad).
