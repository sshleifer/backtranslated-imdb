I've started to melt, so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There's an astronaut, and he gets on a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they return ... well, it does not matter what happened to the others, but our astronaut has started to melt! No, not just burn, but MELT! Like an ice cream in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it gets red and sticky, and the fact that it's melting makes it really angry. I suppose he also revised the "melting man" manual because suddenly he knows that to keep it from melting, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important? WHO will eat more and WHAT will be left of them? How long will it take him to simply melt into nothing? WHY was this movie made in the first place? Where did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep while you see it? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, although the idea is really great and kind. of the gross. The makeup is clean but everything else is ... SPLAT
