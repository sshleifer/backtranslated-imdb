Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires, the last and only hero) has a jet engine in the back of his car, which allows him to make faces without humorous sense while he throws himself into rockets through the desolate desert . Surprise yourself when Mad Max 2 (also known as The Road Warrior) is dissected and spliced ​​again as a new movie, although filmed in a dazzling way with bad actors and a bad play of doubles. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic desert? Simple, the road warrior was! Actually, any question can be answered by: it was like that in Road Warrior! Except for the mutant actors without work of the original movie The Time Machine of the 60s that make an appearance in order to give the audience some non-vehicular action to chew for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are hit or slightly pushed explode in a huge explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will occur near the convenient sides of the cliff and cars will inevitably fall out of them. Along with this wild cinematic journey of the 80s, there is the widespread misogyny in this cheap movie style. In general, I waited for Trace's rocket-propelled car to accelerate and fire the flames so that there would be another image of him wrinkling his face as if it were supposedly hard, which triggers more when he seems constipated. A badly choreographed action coupled with a bad performance makes this film a true sinker. The value of involuntary humor even manages to wear out. <br /> <br /> Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that in itself is saying a lot! According to this 2020 count, Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor Road Warrior imitator who does not have enough cheese factor to make the film visible. <br /> <br />
