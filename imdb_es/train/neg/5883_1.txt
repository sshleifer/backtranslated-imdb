['This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man&#39;s version of &quot;Mommy Dearest.&quot; It represents in graphic and precise way the life that many children of parents with mental illnesses go through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupted and act as if they were God. <br /><br /> Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say it! It&#39;s sick humor at best. <br /><br /> The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use of this film is for people who do not understand mental illness or who do not believe what families really live.']
