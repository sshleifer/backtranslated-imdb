There is not a hint of entertainment in this whole movie. There is not a terrifying, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. It announces itself as a horror, then it is called comedy. Do not even TRY the humor. It does not try to scare either. <br /> <br /> To not get bored by this movie, you should be one of the most entertaining people on earth. If you like this movie, even a LITTLE LITTLE, then you have no standard for what you see. It's hard for me to understand what the filmmakers tried to achieve with this. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. So it was supposed to be a drama? Because it was not really dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please, do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too precious to lose 90 minutes watching this.
