The action in this film beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owns the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in the Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy, I do not see anything positive in this movie. The story seems that the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that the long-distance shooting of Anil Kapoors with a shotgun is the least committed by the director. With the exception of the Tashan directors to make this film there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry to lose my money in this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give in IMDb or I would give it a zero.
