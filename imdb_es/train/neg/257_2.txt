I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie is calling a door! HEE HEE HEE! "), But ... This was so incredibly annoying. There could not be a sustained camera shot, nor a camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be direct, noisy and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad boy tried to be soft and Like Malkovich, but at this point, he's old and tired. It did not bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you saw, too many you've heard before and too many "hard guy" lines ... and I do not care about that kind of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, almost the entire supporting cast just stank. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think it's a lot of fun, and I thought it was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough for me to put up with everything else <br /> <br / > This movie needed less shots, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling and more Jamie Foxx. I gave him a 2.
