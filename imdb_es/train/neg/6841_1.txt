I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc." With the advances in the last 25 years that go from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be revitalized. I just hope it helps eliminate the bad taste that remains in my mouth throughout the Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the video Betamax" was a brilliant milestone in the history of entertainment. After the attempt "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette" and the "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8 Track Tape", who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm crying right now just thinking about it.
