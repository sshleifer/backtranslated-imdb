This is a very serious production. The general consensus has always been that, although Princess Margaret may have been spoiled and spoiled and delighted with the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress failed to convey that. It also seemed that the production budget could not be extended to a hairdresser: from the beginning, Princess Margaret's character's hair had a permanent nest of birds looking disheveled and looked as if she had been dragged by a bush. The actor who plays the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to have prepared for his role to see Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was a farce. <br /> <br /> The production was a waste load, plagued by clich√©s and shameful. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
