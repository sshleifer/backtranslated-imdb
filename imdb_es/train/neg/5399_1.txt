SPOILERS Too often, Hollywood Shakespearean adaptations entertain film pieces. Very well filmed are well made and true to the text. Films that include "Henry V" by Branagh and "Much Ado About Nothing" by 1993 are powerful pieces. Seeing "Love's Labor's Lost" is therefore a disappointment so great that the expectation is so horribly wasted. Unfortunately "Love's Labor's Lost" is horrible! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends have abandoned drinking and women for three years to focus on their studies. However, the plans begin to fall apart when the enigmatic princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her retinue arrive. Soon love is in the air and philosophy is out of the Prince's mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. Intelligently relocated in a musical from the 1930s by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed in favor of musical taste. Classics like "How you look tonight", "Let's face music and dance", "I'm in heaven", all are destroyed by a weak song and the feeling that they just do not belong here. <br /> <In addition to weak chants, we also receive a large number of uncomfortable performances from regular stars. Ken Branagh and his friends might enjoy making this movie, but they give us a variety of roles. <br /> <br /> The eight main actors (four men and four women) are equally terrible, and the only positive one in their name, there is a great improvement in the really frightening Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves the film worthy of any praise and that is the always magnificent Nathan Lane. Over the years, Lane has shown that he is a genius of comedy and in this role, once again, adds an air of humor to the buffoon Costard. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to really say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves a slight praise for Branagh's original version of an old story. Unfortunately, however, that's where the positive aspects end. Weakly acted, performed, sung and built, "Love's Labor's Lost" is perhaps the weakest Shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should never have been done. A poor and disappointing choice on the part of Branagh, and I hope that his next effort will be better.
