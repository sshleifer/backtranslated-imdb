I have never seen a comedy that was such a difficult task to sit through ... there is no laughter in it. Ok, maybe a giggle for Michael Clarke Duncan bit the big, black, bald gay virgin. But the rest was surprisingly little funny. Besides having no laughter, the "parodies" continue forever! Stay away from this if you value your time and money. TERRIBLE!!! Worst!!!
