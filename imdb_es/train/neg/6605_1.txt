Designed only to annoy (or amuse) any intelligent person who respects himself. If the director's intention was that the viewer would not like the title character, then it would have been fine, but I know that a Hollywood director can not criticize the pro-Marxist movement in the United States, especially I'm not a filmmaker of The 70s. Here is so much idiotic dialogue that sometimes I wondered if I was not really watching a comedy. Would not you be guilty of thinking that this is a satire? This is how the naive film appears. Spacek has been in his part of left films, which leads me to the obvious and inescapable conclusion that the redhead is one of those Hollywood idiots. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice tits, but s ** t for the brains.
