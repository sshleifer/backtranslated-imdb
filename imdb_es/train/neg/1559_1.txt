This could be the worst movie I'll see if I live to be 100 years old. I think a group of first graders could have created better arguments as a class project than this one. I'm stupider for having seen it, and God have mercy on the souls that were paid to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> And after I finally turned it off, I had to vomit. <Br /> <br /> No one had a clue about the photograph when he did this. Nobody had any idea of ​​acting. Nobody had any idea. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X shows this shit on occasion. The only time I saw it was in one of the Starz! Channels - not even the main one. And it was turned on around 3 a.m. to that.
