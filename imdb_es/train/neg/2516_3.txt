Unfortunately I do not remember the book anymore, but I do remember that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. It does not appeal to me, although the story itself is good, it is badly adapted. At the center of misery are the characters who are too simplified and exaggerated: they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and well-loved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Are not can not rescue this poor show. However, there is hope ... I have been told that the films that follow this are getting better and better. So, to conclude, I must say that this movie does not deserve the cinematic screen, but it may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
