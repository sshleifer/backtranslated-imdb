No matter what someone tells you, there is a mere fact in the word "possession" in movie circles, such as, "What gave you the green light to this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with that, but common sense does. That is, if your mind is clear and you are in your right mind to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain ... or even interest the average consumer. The star? The history? The unique idea? A movie of friends that children would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? In, my God! I'm sure when this was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere during the course of development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not be translated into a piece of entertainment that someone would want to see or pay for ... unless they were very deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and we saw something that the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a complete disaster. Mess, mess - sin and a mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a paycheck, but I would have been ashamed to accept it. I hope she fired her agent / manager / publicist for this career change. Obviously not, she kept making more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
