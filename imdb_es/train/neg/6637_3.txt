They should have called this movie ... Blonde women who needed to color their roots. Also the main character, geeze, the sweaters too tight. The giggles I thought the boy did a good job though. I'm still waiting for us to find a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. The launch of darts. I also had to laugh at that. We still have 3 more in the DVR to see, maybe we'll be lucky. Oh yes, I discovered the boy pretty fast and nailed him when he picked up the flowers and then he went out with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were heading to the cemetery. And how stupid was it that the two girls followed them there spying on them? Horrifying.
