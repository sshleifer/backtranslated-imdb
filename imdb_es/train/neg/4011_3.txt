For each series that reaches television, 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made and one, only one, reaches production. From such selection process, we are led to believe that the final product should be the cream of the harvest, so other reasons could be rejected so many ideas to give us a single television series. <br /> <br /> And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were aligned and what began as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen game, a pilot and, finally, a series. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a long journey and along the way there are many twists that, in the end, change what was good and pure and show that the production people feel better for the qualifications. Oh, how wrong they are often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has become one of the poorest, worst-performing, and dumbest subplots in history. the recent history of television. His international cast of relatively unknown actors struggles to find their voices, but still stumbles on their false southern accents. The not-so-secret wishes of Alan Ball for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) give us a new naked shot every week, although it often has nothing to do with the story. The characterization of Tara's angry black woman can not be connected and you are secretly waiting for the vampires to take her out quickly before she enters another speech on the suppression of the target while attending a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confederacy. Sam finds a repressed love for Sookie and, suddenly, we must believe that he needs to take care of his morning, afternoon and night, despite years of working with her and avoiding any kind of relationship. <br /> <br /> As for Bill the Vampire, his moral terrain quickly surrendered at the first opportunity to make love with Sookie and he has no problem preparing a quick sandwich (although she remains a bit unscathed). We find the other vampires not as conventional as Bill, but wanting to be accepted by an audience when they look at the living as Happy Meals with legs. <br /> <br /> Despite my best efforts to suffer through the first six episodes I have come to the conclusion that no matter how long you watch a bad program, it is still bad. Some things die for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should do it.
