Shortly after watching this movie, I questioned the mental competence of each actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overvalued opportunity? However, I must give credit where the credit is owed. Some moments of the film were unpredictable and quite disconcerting, but they barely compensated for the perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, male or female, who has any kind of respect for himself.
