This has to fall as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Horrible acting, horrible script ... and it was the good points! One that you definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson continues to trust her body to downplay the fact that her performance is so plastic! I sat ready to give it a try, hoping it would get better, which, alas, it did not! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you prepare yourself for a good read! I like Denise Richards, which is why I tried this movie, but the reason why she has been released in this movie is beyond me!
