This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've seen. It just did not stand out, really. As for the cards, I thought it was going to be pretty good, but all the matches seemed to fall short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit against MVP One of the best matches. Benoit took him. I just did not think MVP was that good, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe it's Khali and any other living person does not mix. Fantastic match <br /> <br /> Melina against Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this fight, until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst game of MITB so far. Just a big disappointment, for many people in the ring at the same time. It just did not measure up. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Vs. Umaga O.K. It's not extremely impressive, but it's not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker This was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena against Shawn Michaels I really feel that this match deserved to be the last. People defend Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. However, I'm starting to get tired of watching Cena win every game. It's getting a little old. Now, I have to say that I feel like this game is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit skewed. Batista vs. 'Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and almost everything else fell short.
