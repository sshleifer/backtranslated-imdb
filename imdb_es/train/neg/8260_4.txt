First of all, I would like to point out that, although I am not an expert, the way in which the trial was handled will insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution never showed that 'facilitated learning' really works. Irresponsible both for the prosecution (because they can get an appeal) and for the defense for not acting in this regard. As another commentator said, the facilitated learning turned out to be false. Second, they used Terry as the translator who has a personal interest, and will even testify, at the trial, that he is simply stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify in that way, they would have brought someone neutral, otherwise, they would only be requesting an appeal. Third, the prosecution never asked specific questions about the accused to this child (birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when the defense asked specific questions such as when it started, he could not respond. If that is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is and a competent lawyer would have obtained an acquittal. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it starts off well with the pressure of being the father of a child with Autism, but the trial makes this movie totally unbelievable.
