This movie was made for people who considered Gremlins too serious and Critters hardcore. Like many of the 80's critters / trolls / gremlins movies, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is not a key phrase for that comment. It's just bad and not in a funny way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be fun and ends up being as successful as Howie Mandell in Walk Like A Man. What made the horror films of the other 80 become classics was that they were really trying to be scary, but they were hilarious because they failed miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, THE Bettina Hirsch) that she had a special ability for comedy before starting to direct this movie. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, seeing a small cross between a ferret and a tumor with a brown raincoat and throwing billiard balls at an outcast of the Lost Boys is fun, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> By far, the most annoying part of the movie is Paul's character. Your Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start moving fast from the moment of your first scene until the final credits only stop once to see a scene in which a hooligan throws billiard balls to a guy ... It is not that he has done it. Then, the conclusion is to run, not walk, to your nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to store this pile of garbage on the shelves.
