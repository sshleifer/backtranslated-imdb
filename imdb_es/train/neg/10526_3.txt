Tedious movie of girls in the reform, which looks like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is trapped there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she is raped by her fellow "inmates". <br /> <br /> For too long (even at 98 minutes), with an absolutely useless ending that makes the whole movie seem useless. <Br /> <br /> Linda Blair, 15, does her best to avoid showing her body when she's undressed, but lets her nipple slip during a shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** *
