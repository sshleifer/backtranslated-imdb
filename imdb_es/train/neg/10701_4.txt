The lunatic lunatics of London organize a treasure hunt, with a young woman who is inadvertently arranging her married political father with a strong and independent flying lady who has never been in love. Intriguing initial vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, who plays an aviator similar to Amelia Earhart, who has been too involved in herself to give herself to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to obtain the feminine point of view, but why all the old clich√©s remain intact as frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of wife who cries and makes herself cry who lies in bed when something goes wrong, and the final scene of Hepburn is another roll. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate's observers. ** since ****
