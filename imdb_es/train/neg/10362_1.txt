Disney? What happened? I really wish the film was filmed in the 60s, as was the book. And I really could have handled cheap special effects to save the budget for a more precise adaptation ... I'm glad that, maybe, someone can be influenced to read the books ... but, The Man with interchangeable red eyes like IT ? And what about the volcanic turmoil? Where was ESO in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I'm sure I'd like to identify him. I can only imagine that it could be closer to the real story than this bad adaptation. This movie needs to be X'd.
