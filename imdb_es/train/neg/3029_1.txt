From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible sequence of extremely short cuts of blurred camera work. While the general plot has all the potential for a thriller, the story is told so badly that I can not buy it. From the middle of the movie, the actions of the characters do not make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea that Edna makes coffee for them after shooting his son's arm is far below his supposed experience; It's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino, who does not question the fragmentary orders he receives from Claremont Williams for a break in the telephone connection, simply eludes me; Should not she suspect for too long that Williams is giving them up? Those FBI agents seem to be crazy about appearing with a single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a shootout by the capital mafia. In addition, what they do retaining and leaking information towards Cigliutti is practically an incitement to murder; I think it's a farewell to justice if that's how the FBI does the investigations. In reality, they would have a case in poor condition beyond repair if they acted in this way. We have the opportunity to see a car accident that would normally have at least serious injuries if it did not kill most of the passengers, but miraculously leaves them all with only a few bruises. Quite the contrary, immediately after the accident, Domino makes love to Choco, which from Domino's point of view is not based on previous events, but is drugged to the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes from Claremont Williams' phone call seems to me to be a true flash of glare. This, combined with the horrible and uncomfortable camera work, makes a piece hesitate to call a movie. I am sorry for the useless effort of the main actors, whose talent is beyond discussion.
