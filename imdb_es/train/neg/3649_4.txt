This is a small program just about the paranormal, although it seems as if Art Bell and his class discovered how to develop a career based on the attitude that Carl Kolchak exemplified. Of course, there probably would not be an X Files if this program had not prepared this audience so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the superhero type, but he is a plausible type (enough) to perform heroic actions. Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction, there does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife that is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sex appeal for the show. Something I am also noticing is that the rhythm is not really suspense in a typical way. There is a lot of disposable humor for this show. Sometimes it's just pokey to climax. There is a thread of this program that reaches the present of MAD MEN in terms of style. It's not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked with him on The Sopranos have definitely emulated and inherited his serious-comedic tone.
