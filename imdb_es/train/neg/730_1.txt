I have not seen the first movie and if something like this I do not have a great desire to do it. <br /> <br /> Having seen it a few hours ago, I am struggling to remember something about it. <br /> <br /> For what I remember is that the main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people who stay in a house with that bad-tempered old woman of Friday the 13th and are stalked by wooden boards. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I am initiating a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie because I want compensation for the time I lack in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this movie away from me ... oh, wait, I already gave it to a "friend".
