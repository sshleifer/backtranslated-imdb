This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Foreseeable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that qualified a point was that there were some beautiful scenes that highlighted Barcelona. I imagine they would use movies like this one in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture the suspects. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies have some exchangeable features, this has nothing. If I was in it or worked in it, I would change my name. Truly a turd. It is difficult to write more than this, but I think that the viewers of the movie of the world needed to be attentive to this. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people you can not stand. <br /> <br /> You could send it to politicians you do not like, in laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and many others.
