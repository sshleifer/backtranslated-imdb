Although THE FLOCK has a good performance by veteran Richard Gere, and some correct shots that could go back to some of the days of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the film extends its credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that It really does not lead anywhere. br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the security department and is preparing to retire. His office pushes him to his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his work. And that job is not very fun. He watches over hundreds of sex offenders who are on probation in their jurisdiction. Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to verify his "flock" of criminals and learns that he desperately needs his retirement. But Erroll is good at his job, even if his methods are not. He makes fun of sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by mentioning the past of these deviants. It is this "good justification" that challenges the audience at some level, allowing us to see how brutal Erroll is, and yet how out of touch he has become (being too close to his work). <br /> <br /> When a teenager disappears in Erroll's "area", he immediately jumps to the conclusion that she was kidnapped by one of her flocks. But how could I know? Is Erroll so good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll recoils. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the configuration of the story was fine, I did not have any umpf! However, I will give credit to Richard Gere, who plays the character of Erroll very well. Fight against retirement. Concerned about all those who are close to their flock. Disgusted with those he is responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of the things he does. A whole change in the representation of the character for Gere. But beyond him there is not much more. Some of the sets are good (they are dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement when watching movies. But that suspension has limits. The greatest impulse against these limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital scenes of crime. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling on a crime scene. Or evidence in movement. It went further and damaged the film until the end. <br /> <br /> The other damaging part of this movie is that we never get into the character of Clair Danes, Allison. At the end of the film, he almost stays out of the way and we never find out what his intention might be: Will he stay or leave? Will it end like Erroll if it stays? This is not a horrible movie, since it touches an uncomfortable moral terrain, but the story as a whole had to be more strict.
