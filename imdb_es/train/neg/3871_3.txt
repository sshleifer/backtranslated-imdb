I try to be very objective when I watch a low budget movie. I also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions compared to big budget productions. I expect almost no shortcomings of big budget productions and their studies. Therefore, I apply more stringent criteria to the main study launches. But this movie was just a failure. Period. The premise was terrible. The protagonist, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was amazing as a high school student with an insatiable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or in his performance to take you to his world. In addition, to make this film more mysterious, lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the store. <br /> <br /> Once again, another disappointing movie to which I could only give three points.
