I was attracted to this movie, curious to see how they adapted the brutal novel by Hubert Shelby. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrible situations and social criticism could not be translated into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible cinematic experience, not because of its content, but because of its form. The director Ulrich Edel executes, in my sincere opinion, a terrible director's work that does not do justice to the original book. It is not surprising that Edel is a television director; This movie looks and feels like a bad movie "made for television". Some of my views on this pump (** spoilers ahead **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of creativity as a director. The scenes are slow, they feel slow, they look bad and they almost never move from an anchored position. The only freedom they take is in the area of ​​cinematography, with a beautiful dark tone. Apart from that, the film has the same technical creativity as a telenovela. <br /> <br /> - All the actors do an excellent job of portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that adaptation does not address a basic element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to make things from nothing, like robots, without any reason. Edel loses every opportunity to enrich the development of the character by not exploring the motivations of the character, and by avoiding developing the personality of each character in its entirety. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is evident in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this shoddy prostitute, but her alcohol-induced decision to allow sailors to violate her is not explained. It seems extremely stupid, since we see this character doing this out of nothing. This is a clear example of poor development of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film also has many secondary characters who do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to learn more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between the two. That is another lost opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel only approaches the development of the character with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to ruin him in the end, without clearly explaining, once again, his motivations. Bullies are also a joke for their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've experienced. Terrible job for Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is very deficient. Sometimes, as in the battle between the union workers and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the film. He also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I could swear that the entire soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the real action. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation of the book by Desmond Nakano is so literal that it eliminates the point of history. It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-for-action argument in the book, that they forgot to really develop the characters and, once again, explained their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> Seriously I can not recommend this movie, even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very uninspired effort to adapt the novel, and shows very little creative input.
