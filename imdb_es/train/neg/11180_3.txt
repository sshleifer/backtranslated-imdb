The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of films in which Al Pacino should avoid acting. The first big change I had was the way Pacino tried to represent a Georgia accent; sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. The dialogue and interaction of the characters was terrible, along with a weak plot. The supporting cast did an extremely subtle job to keep the film interesting, and within an hour I still did not see signs of a solid argument. The story in general is really boring, and I had to slap myself several times to stay awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bore you too ... avoid it at all costs.
