I found it embarrassing to see this movie. I felt that I was pushing the story down my throat, as if I could not grasp the subtleties, I needed a voice to spell them all to myself constantly. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an Alcoholic, I did not really feel that it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion, of course. They find it hard to communicate, something the main character did not really have a problem with, except that he had a problem saying that I love you at a given moment, which was a somewhat weak effort to establish his cold character. Was he constantly surrounded by people too ?! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time were we really alone with the character to really have an idea of ​​their internal loneliness and confusion. I could not connect with the character and I did not feel any connection at all considering my father. I did not feel anything at all when it ended, only relief because it was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but he is not a strong character! The orange clock was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, they should have obtained three different characters or avoided the adolescent stage and concentrate more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt that the little boy actor was really good At the beginning of the movie !!
