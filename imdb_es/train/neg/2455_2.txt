I remember that I went to see the movie with my parents in the summer of '78, and that I really liked it at that time. Of course, I was seven years old at that time. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it before and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran out of money in the middle of the animation process of this film, and was forced to drastically cut the aspects of this production. Since this movie was mainly made with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people with a limited budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the vaguest sense of the word. There are some scenes that, obviously, are only people who are in front of a screen, with perhaps some animation effects superimposed on top of each other. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the film is already a compression of "The Fellowship of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - it was further reduced. What you get is something like a movie strip version of the Cliff Notes books. <br /> <br /> Not everything is bad, however, the animation gives a touch of warmth, which I found in Jackson. films. It is nice to imagine what could have been with decent financing. <br /> <br /> This movie is also notable for having the sequel that never came. Several years later, a television special was broadcast for half an hour of half-time, destined to wrap things up. All I'll say about that is that it was a musical.
