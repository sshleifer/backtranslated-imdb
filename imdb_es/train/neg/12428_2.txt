I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I still wonder why they made this horrible movie. The thing with the plastic gun and the toy car, which can go to another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were very funny, but the terrorists in this movie are so stupid and not so funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
