It seems that there is little in the way of the middle ground in regards to Watch On the Rhine. You like it a lot, applauding your sincerity, your liberal point of view and your good acting, or you hate your obvious propaganda, the mediocre dialogue, the cardboard characters and the general trend. I fall a lot in this last category, and I found the film and the game, in relation to the activities of the European refugees in Washington during the war, a crushing hole, which is worthwhile mainly for the performance, and even then only in a way intermittent. That the author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. His works were written for people who shared his point of view, and rarely explored ideas that the author and the public did not yet have, except to point out how terrible the "other side" is. Even when I am one hundred percent in agreement with what she has to say, as in the Rhine, I still can not stand the way she says it. His characters are unreal, and while his ear for dialogue shows a certain ease by the way people talk, does not have a true brightness or originality. She really did not have anything new to say. I totally agree with Mary McCarthy's long delay in dismantling Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or in extremis and long for the good old days, I urge you to take a look at Watch On the Rhine, as bad in its way as Angels In America, which only serves to show that the theater had a foot. In the grave sixty years ago.
