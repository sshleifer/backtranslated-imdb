"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is, quite simply, the worst movie ever made, much slower than even the inept "Plan 9 from Outer Space". <br /> <br /> The Lampoon movie appears in three segments, each supposedly a parody of a conventional movie genre, but each one landing at our feet with a disgusting noise. There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes, and there are no discernible lines of history. <br /> <br /> Another critic on this site has written that the only positive points about the film are the nude scenes. It's true that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry make some meat, and very well, it is also. But managers do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing of that here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young policeman eager for beavers who is paired with a cynical veteran played by Widmark. And just for a moment, those of us who are still watching this hateful cinematic exercise are encouraged by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive story about how the young idealistic policeman produces a purifying change in the veteran's approach. police work But there is not so much luck. As we said, this movie has no redeeming values. It's disgusting all the way to the final demise, which, perversely, stretches more than it should last on the screen. Apparently, the filmmakers knew they had something bad going on and wanted to take advantage of it.
