John Pressman (Micheal 'You should call me Ditech' Lerner) works in a doctor's office as an assistant. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to people who see him badly. But this turns out to be a movie inside a movie, but the lines soon fade when John goes to a movie theater to kill. Ask a boy who is watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is adequately above this, but Zelda repeats the lines of dialogue over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But it's not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie in a movie. Like a horror movie, it fails, is too busy trying to be smart, trying to convey a message and seems to forget that a slasher movie should evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of killer: that of an art house. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
