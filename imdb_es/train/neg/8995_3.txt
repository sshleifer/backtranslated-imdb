I missed the beginning but I saw most of it. A friend got it on a DVD in the cheap FYE room. <br /> <br /> The parodies are very short, and most of them are still too long. Most of them, seem to have forgotten to have something funny! Much humor racist / sexist / "homophobic" in him, parodies based on stereotypes or parodies that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to remember everything I thought was funny, and I'm having problems ... The Tunnel Vision network logo is a lipstick mouth with an eyeball in it. The mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids. A little creepy. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most of the actors went on to better things, and it's a good thing that this bomb did not stop them.
