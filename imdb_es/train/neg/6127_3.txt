As I am from Hungary, I have heard many people say better and better things about Üvegtigris so far, but I do not really understand the reason for all the fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked many points of the movie, Some of the quotes really made me happy, but the stereotyped characters are present again, as in all Hungarian films, and the story is also quite boring. I liked the first half, but then I started getting bored, and then I found that the whole movie just BORED. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is good as always, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are there. ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years remain to pass for a GOOD Hungarian movie?
