SPOILERS TOOLUGHOUT: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is mainly an action movie. And what action must be taken! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I have not seen the original, but I really did not care about this, although Bassenger and Baldwin have a good chemical screen. But the movie itself did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> The Gettaway became really boring quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one fight / pursuit after another and, as the violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their great appearance regardless of the dangers they are in. In fact, at the end of the movie they almost look BETTER then at the beginning. I do not think the makeup of Bassenger's eyes moves once during the whole image. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and unless it's one. a purist of action movies that I can not see really enjoying this movie because there is simply not much here. The Gettaway is not terribly original either, and goes from all the senses unnecessarily brutal to quite boring. I think it really could have been better. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give good results, but they do not have much to do except be chased and run for their lives. Sometimes, less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again, it becomes obsolete. I did not enjoy this much.
