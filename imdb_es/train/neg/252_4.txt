The uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a beautiful but gentle adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than sincere, and appearances tied with money by ghosts do not round off any sense of wonder or magic; Edward Woodward, as the present Christmas Phantom, staggers on stilts and seems to be making an impression of Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too ironic, and it seems he never really believes in it, which robs him of its effect. The scenes in which he shows his past have as much impact as if he were flipping through his family album. It seems that no one else is making any effort, except Frank Finlay, who chronically exceeds.
