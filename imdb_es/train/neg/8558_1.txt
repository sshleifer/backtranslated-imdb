This movie was absolutely horrible, I even feel uncomfortable calling it a movie. It's the typical "Mumblecore" movie, with zero plot and a group of twentysomething aimlessly stumbling trying to "solve things". I tried to give Mumblecore a try, but let's be honest, it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of sync with the movies, I appreciate the films of Dogme95, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies of all time. So I do not care if a movie is made at low cost whenever there is any substance (ANY). <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is horrible, acting, writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but most of the time, above all, the work of the camera was simply a simple nonsense. The camera was never logical anywhere, there was no consistency. I must admit that being a boy I had heard there was nudity in this movie, so I thought well, although it is horrible that at least there is nudity (yes, I know, I'm a jerk). Well, thanks to the excellent work of the camera, you can never see anything, and the things you see, TRUST ME, DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This movie made me want to throw up on numerous levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me want to vomit, the camera work made me want to vomit, but above all the idea that this film was praised by some legitimate critics. Well, now that I want to vomit more than anything.
