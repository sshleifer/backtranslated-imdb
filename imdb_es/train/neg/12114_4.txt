Strangers who live in a village live their lives. There is the licker, a boy who licks everything, a diver who finds a body that he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a boy who wants to clean the girls of their bad ways. .. out of the ordinary In the end, this black and white photo is better without the color. The monochrome removes the edge of the two steps upwards from the feel of a home movie. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun and starts, but mostly it is rare for the sake of strangers and soon becomes a bore, as one sees the configurations that you can guess where the greatest goes part of the time, not always. but enough so that it is not fun (although I did not see the cleaning coming). It's worth a shot if you do not have anything else to do and you're waiting for the next Netflix Golden Girls group to arrive.
