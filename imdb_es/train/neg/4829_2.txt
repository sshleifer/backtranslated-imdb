As a normal moviegoer, I can not say that I enjoyed watching this one. It's not too emotional for a drama, it's not too exciting for a thriller, it's not too fast for an action. In addition, some moments of the film are little credible. Okay, I understand, the soldiers go a little crazy, but it's hard to believe that a person risks his life, assaults in the middle of a hostile city, and after a professor's wife yells that he runs away, without having made a question (appropriately). It would look terribly romantic if it was an animation or something, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS movie about the war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture gives the impression that it's just a preview of a movie, and it takes a lot of work. <br /> <br /> It feels as if the movie creators would like to create an image of an emotional and courageous soldier, but all these "curves" of their psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why did you get an Oscar? Why SIX? And in my humble opinion it is the most exciting part of the movie :)
