The film is basically a boring chain of frightful clich√©s that do not offer a true intercultural vision. The stage of the trip in the Middle East is described in a particularly irritating way: obviously there are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how the camels and date palms of the whole image were missing. The personality of the two main characters is very crooked and many situations are not very credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you are looking for cultural information, you should skip this movie.
