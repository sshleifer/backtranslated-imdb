- When the local sheriff is murdered, his wife assumes the position and is determined to clean the city. However, not everyone in the city is happy with what they are doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the city, the owner of the local salon (also a woman) hires a murderer to take care of the sheriff. There is no way for the owner of the room to know that the sheriff and the murderer would fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a very interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There is a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger could have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things that are wrong with the film: a cast of support without the ability to act, forced and unnatural dialogues, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the edition. I was surprised how many times a scene would start with the actors (and the horses, obviously) waiting for Corman to shout "Action". The best thing is the scene of two riders on horseback right next to a building. Suddenly, they come and go running around the corner as if they had been driving hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who apparently can be transported through the city. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge through the city to ride his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not like Corman does not have some decent actors to work with. While neither was a big star, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were able to get a good performance. But, at Gunslinger, they are not given much to work with. <br /> <br />: Now I have seen the MST3K and not MST3K versions of the movie. I highly recommend going the MST3K route.
