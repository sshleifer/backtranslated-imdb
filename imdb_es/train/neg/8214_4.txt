This does not just probe the depths of Creepshow 3, but it's close. He also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is a distraction to say the least. <br /> <br /> It's also quite annoying and tearing apart The Twilight Zone (with the library being comparable to the later Serling Night Gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and writers forgot that Serling would generate sympathy for his characters before ruining them. None of the characters is particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West is ... well, himself. He does not go to Bruce Wayne / Batman's route in the 60s, but he rarely does. He simply plays "Jay", which is not particularly enigmatic (there is a sinister spine name to compare with the likes of Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper), and makes some slightly awkward / creepy statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Seen "A stop at Willoughby" by Rod Serling? Then you have seen this. The red herring of the nutso wife has no purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a puny. As well directed as you can expect, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of several travel stories in the time of Serling, mixed with "A Meeting of Minds" by Steve Allen. Most of the actors are not so bad (except for Josh Astin as Casio, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is interesting. But like Abernathy, it's not going anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bothers a little (who would not?), And for some reason ends up being banished to a nuclear desert. <br /> <br /> Repetition of life: it's not a bad little piece, and it manages to precede Click and Creepshow 3. I guess it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of the remotes. The main character is slightly sympathetic. There is nothing substantially innovative here, but it's fine. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see the turn that is looming a mile away, but as the main character, it has some heart and is a decent story of defeat and redemption. <Br /> <br /> Final: So ... why do people end up cold stored in silver suits? I do not know And it does not make sense. So ... all the protagonists entered the bookstore and were trapped? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the boy from the first segment died. So, how did he get caught? Did you visit the bookstore before you died, got caught and ... did not die? What? Eh I guess you do not expect this to make sense because it's supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically it's no different from the two new Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth it. But there's nothing really spectacular here.
