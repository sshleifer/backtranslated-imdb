Well, what to say. THE GOLDEN BOY falls into the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy is having some funny lines (and sometimes quite annoying), but you're still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain Sardo Numspa (what name does this name have?). <br /> <br /> Who should see THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say, but my best guess would be that people like shameful movies and can entertain themselves with bad acting, bad plot and an even more shameful dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
