We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to go see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband also hated it. The only fun parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stop outside the cinema and tell people to save their money. The writing was horrible. He had all the terrible stereotypes of Hispanics who should be completely offended. The movie was not that long, but it seemed like an eternity to us. The people in the theater were so restless and silent that it was like watching the paint dry. I made my husband stay because he was sure that maybe there would be some redeemed parts, but there were not. Save money and your time.
