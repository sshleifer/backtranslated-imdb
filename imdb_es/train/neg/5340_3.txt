*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do, and he does everything possible with an incredible role. I can see how this is a movie that could look good as a script, but it's complicated, unlikely and, ultimately, silly. I saw that the fake death ended a mile away. Rene Z. strives with an assured party, and so does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can not remember (the one who is not Chris Penn) is a great sweaty actor. Look at it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie that is so smart that you can not follow it, and so confusing that you can not understand it. Look at it if you like the camera work that makes you dizzy. See if you like watching Tim Roth work with a hard-to-manage script. See him if he comes late at night for free. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
