Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends poisoned orchids to brides on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance / carriage and takes him home for his dwarf helper to extract the glandular juices to keep Bela's wife forever Young. Some second-rate actors who play detectives try to solve the terrible and terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi does it very well, but you can say she needed the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is awfully awful, and most of the actors would have been better than sticking to the waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell someone what happens in it and they tend to laugh a lot and demand to watch the movie. I got the DVD at a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a pretty accurate appraisal, anyone who pays more for this would be out of their mind.
