Pretty standard things from the movie B Seriously, anyone watching "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a group of people making their first film should know that they should not expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rework formulas that are popular. If you give them even a symbolic analysis, you will end up ruining the film for you (and perhaps write a slanderous and important criticism in IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought she was remarkably attractive. It was a memorable appearance of B-movie. Unfortunately, I do not see where he has made any film since then. I will watch her again.
