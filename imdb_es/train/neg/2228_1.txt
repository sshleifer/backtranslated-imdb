This film is weak, the cover of the box says that the hardest gang in East Los Angeles and that is actually the Santa Ana, James Cahill acts as a wardrobe queen knocking down all the tough guys in the gang of Chlo . It is false, boring, meaningless and meaningless. I tried to get my money back from the video store, this movie was so bad. It was also at the homoerotic tip away from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill should act in Gay Porn. James is in every scene, he can not act to save his life. The movie features Eva Longoria who is sexy, but James can not even dial with her !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I felt I was watching Gay Porn and that the whole movie got discouraged. James clearly wants to be with men, but instead of submitting to his homosexual desires, he hits the gang members again and again. His martial arts skills are minimal at best, some members of real gangs will take him and his weak skills and steal a new one.
