What else remains to be said? <br /> <br /> I have read all the comments here and most are correct. . However, one person even called this movie evil and Satan contaminated it (or something like that). Wrong?! Wow, what a surprise. . I mean, TBN basically made this movie. Open your eyes, please. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this was the lowest degree of nonsense nonsense that has appeared in years. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying thing about the Omega Code is the amount of money. They spent to do it. If this movie can be made, there are no limits and, therefore, we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses the omega codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in the biblical stories, the new Dogma movie will take back the place where the Omega Code never started.
