This movie was terrible. Okay, my favorite movie is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always a bit skewed. <br /> <br /> The plot rambles, throwing enough key elements from the original for the term 'remake' to be highly dubious. (She's not a virgin, but she's allergic to bees.) Wow!) There are a lot of things that do not make sense and are inexplicable, which I'm afraid Mr. LaBute does not make a horror movie. (How are two people we saw clearly exploited in a car at first, alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks emaciated and bewildered, and his character is prone to say "Rowan !?" at the least noise. The 'winks' to the original are irritating, as they become more sticky than as an intelligent tribute. For example, certain incidents reflect the original (the girl who falls out of a closet that pretends to be dead when Woodward / Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are extracted directly from the original script by Anthony Schaffers and are framed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can not bother writing more about this movie. It lacks any type of substance. Throw it in the scrap heap with all the other versions that have tainted the good names of the movies in which they were "based" (in this case, very freely).
