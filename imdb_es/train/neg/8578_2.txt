One of the dumbest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, leader of the orchestra and radio star (and the fraternity of the eternal college of nonsense), was a kind of forerunner of Spike Jones, who swallowed his guests and was voluntarily backed by his cheerful group of musicians. He was hired to attend a birthday party in a grim mansion, the kind in which poisonous darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The shindig is harassed by a creepy judge, a scary teacher, a sinister swami, lots of laughing women and enough bad jokes to fill three images of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to brag about, and neither is Kyser too confident, and he's equipped with rib-elbow material dating back to 1940 years ago. * since ****
