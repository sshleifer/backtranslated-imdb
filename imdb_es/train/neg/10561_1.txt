I watched this movie in its own time period, when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but also stamped your son as a bastard. In these days of "single mothers" that may seem very unlikely, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who stutters. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this funny movie. At that time I did not know who had directed it or what a wonderful reputation it had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because I was so frantic. I loved "Bringing Up Baby", but this movie seems embarrassing. I'm sure the knock on some church functions probably went off, but I was the one who needed a drink after seeing this again. The idea that the girl would have to be drunk to "get married" and get pregnant has just added to the misery. In these circumstances, a whole city could attack you, so the result of this movie is really the fun part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like it either. "It's a wonderful life."
