Action, violence, sex and rude language are the things that the characters do throughout the film. And everything they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is (a) known for his violent movies (no reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. The actors interpret their stupid characters very well ... I do not say that they are stupid, but I want to say that they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget unknown B-action movie. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies of the same type as Misbegotten ... do not rent it ... and, by the way, do not rent any of the films I mentioned .. I give it 1 and a half of 5.
