Would someone tell Shaq to stick to what is good in basketball? This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level. In this film, Shaq plays a genius who lives in a boom box, is that he is not an original genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. He is supposed to help a small child played by the equally annoying frankis cappra. This movie had the weakest story since the water world, the acting was horrible and I think that anyone who likes this movie would be afraid to admit it.
