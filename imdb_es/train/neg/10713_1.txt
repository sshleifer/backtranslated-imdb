Come on, let's face it. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar, as they are more commonly called, did not even exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so laughable that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren looked bored. And also, if you wanted to have a Templar in real life, why not use the Knights of Christ, which still exist in Portugal? At least they should have taken the story into account. The only redeeming quality that I could find in this film was that the artifacts seemed authentic enough to pass them through medieval or Gothic pieces. The acting was bad, the story terrible, the action horrible, and the accessories were fine.
