If it were not for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as clueless thugs, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on a 10-year high school reunion, which takes place at a supposed drop-out high school (it looks more like a fixture in a low-budget horror movie than the one the 1950s), and the deranged student of the class made a very traumatic joke. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, since only one student is murdered, as is the lunch lady (Anne Ramsey de Goonies). They make us believe that they kill the horny together, but we never see a damn thing! This is a horrible movie that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon throughout the 80s and 90s.
