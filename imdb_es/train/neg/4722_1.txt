do not watch this Serbian documentary and the Serbian propaganda look for this documentary and you will see facts and truths http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The series of documentaries The death of Yugoslavia (of five episodes) it is a carefully compiled and researched account of the extensive bloodshed that marked the end of the former federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990s. It includes a large amount of news and interviews with the parties involved, both "Yugoslav" and other types. The only real "improvement" that could be achieved with this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was carried out. In fact, this was done in the late 1990s for a replay on BBC television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help complete this admirably detailed and complete work. Maybe another whole episode could be justified? The very concise title of this documentary was made even more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the now-named Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal admission of what happened years earlier. /> <br /> nonfiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Preventable War (1999)"
