Everyone who wants to be an editor should see this movie! It shows you all the mistakes you should not make when editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's really so bad that I can not write a sentence without the exclamation point!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is wrongly copying the recipe. from the first. The funny parts can be counted with one hand and maybe with half. Clavier is overacting his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to act as Lemercier (because he is replacing it) but that is "grotesque". Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be fun alone on stage, she is not in this movie because she is not acting as she used to. I know it should be hard to replace someone who was good in a role (Lemercier won a Cesar award for his role in the first film) but he made a big mistake: instead of playing his role, he played? Lemercier interpreting it. paper'! As for the story, it's too much! Of course, at the end of the first film we knew there would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier should have tried to write a simpler story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there are no more than 3 fun parts in this. The only good things can be the costumes and some special effects. So you only have 2 reasons to see it: 1) if you want to learn to edit a movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a "brainless moment". 2/10
