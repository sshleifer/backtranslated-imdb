First a technical review. The script is very slow, it's actually a 25-minute story extended to 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pathetic, it seems that they have really taken the students out of the class to read some lines of a board of idiots. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely, "war is bad" (oh, there's a shock!) It really does not exist. Without the scene of "we let them impact and get great publicity", nobody would talk about this movie. It's so bad that it really bothers me to think about what better things this money could have spent. Believe me, I've seen some bad films of "emperor's new clothes", but the only thing I can say about them is that they were at least well filmed and well made, while the camera wobbled during two scenes on this! Read all other reviews: avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
