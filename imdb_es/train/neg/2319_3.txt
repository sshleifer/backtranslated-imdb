A lot of silly plot holes in the movie. First we see him watching his teacher practice kung fu, and die in the middle of his practice. That is good for me. And then, at the end of the movie, we see him use the kung-fu he learned just by watching his teacher when he was still a child. Is that possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is only for fans of Jay Chou, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, film styles and plot unfolding. <br /> <br /> Does anyone realize that the team captain of the basket (forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao are very similar to each other, to the extent that one would think they were the same person? Long hair, child sun look, tall and strong. The two seemed to have left a mass production factory designed to produce products that make teenage girls scream wildly in orgasm. It's not that these two actors had anything of value to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were unconvincing and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> The scene regarding Jay Chou's 4 teachers who returned to help him on the basketball court, degenerated into a useless plot when they began to beat his Royal Rumble-style opponents. Worse, when the 4 teachers won the fight, the crowd began to applaud and the match continued. Was it really a WTF? Moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the program, when they won the match, all thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired those kung fu skills is a mystery, because the program somehow shows that he acquires skills just by observing his teacher. <br /> <br /> And then his father lost a long time ago to recognize Jay. Chou, like his long-lost son, seemed too quick for the director to wrap the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou movie (instead of the usual "girl movie"). Look at it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in the movies match a lot with those on the list of the 250 best IMDb movies of all time, then this movie is not for you.
