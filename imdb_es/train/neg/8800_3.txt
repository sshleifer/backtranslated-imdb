A collection of deleted scenes and alternative shots, edited together and with an added voiceover to make it appear to take place after the first's events. Pretty good idea, but the deleted scenes are left on the floor of the courtroom for a reason and this is further proof. As it is not as funny as "Anchorman", and really be realistic THAT THE movie was not exactly golden comedy, so you get a 'movie' worse than one that was moderately funny. In my opinion, I STILL place it one or two notches above "Kicks and Shouts" or "Haunted". Cross your fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to the old school form (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My grade: D
