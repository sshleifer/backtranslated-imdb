Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a man who roams the earth performing demonstrations of self-mutilation as a way to deal with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because without hearing the comment of a director Andy Copp (which he did not have available to me) or reading the film before watching it, the viewers will have no idea what it is. br /> <br /> Gorehounds and extreme movie fans can be enticed to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splashing and disturbing images from real life, but unless they're also pretentious fans, headache inductors. , experimental cinema in an art house, you will find that this is a real task to sit down. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images accompanied by a messy sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this amazes the perfect way to test your own sanity: if you still have all your marbles, you will turn off this garbage and You'll see something decent in its place (I saw it all, but I'm aware that I'm barking completely)!).
