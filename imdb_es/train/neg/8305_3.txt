Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I've never heard of this movie and maybe for a good reason, it's horrible. The same place, the same narrator, the same director, but lacked the blurred warmth of the original. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone replacing him. History seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story," Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun seems cute, but his obsession in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the bully of the original neighborhood, is replaced in this movie by another boy with suspenders and a strange hat but with little of the threatening attractiveness of Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to match the original, even if this film had been made with the original equipment.
