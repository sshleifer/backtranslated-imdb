This is the biggest insult to TMNT. Fortunately, officially Venus does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female turtle, this will be removed from the tragic story of 4 unique male mutants who will never have a family of their own, once they have disappeared. The biggest mistake was crossing Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; The voices of the turtle were EVIL and all acted out of place. They could have done a better job, better designs and animatronics and NOT VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with these people ... it's material worth ravaging. the lip flap was slow and unnatural. They did not fully respect the shredder. The main villain, a guy from the dragon lord was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging from their bodies, what about the thing around Raph's thigh? The silly-looking sculpted plastrons !? <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, they acted like a character and they got rid of Venus, they got rid of the stupid cartoon sounds for children ... and better to write it could have been good.
