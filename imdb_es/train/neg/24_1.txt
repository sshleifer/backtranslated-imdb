I have to congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think you're a partner, you can not get all the low-cost amateur garbage pieces, whose only intention is to get some money. <br /> <br /> The filming is bad, and I mean MALO. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better. <br /> <br /> The acting, let's say: do not go to the supermarket in search of actors. The good ones usually come with a title or, at least, they have some damn experience! The director ... Mr. Jon Keeyes, find your purpose in life, as a director, it just sucks. His address is poor, the angles are ruined (not in a good way), the lines seem to be being read on toilet paper, and the damn music ... always appears when it should not and it goes out for no apparent reason. And do not go for a writer either, by the way. Making movies is not like serving a coffee shop, it requires art and skill, things that I really doubt you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a shooting movie, you should have filmed this one. return to oblivion and wait until something good has arisen ... Or just go find a job in a cafeteria. You will have less stress and you will save money to moviegoers and a bad night. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first)
