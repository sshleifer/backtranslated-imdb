I liked how this started, with some decent special effects, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There was a pretty impressive landscape. However, the film gets stuck pretty soon with a very silly dialogue since all the men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius".) <br /> <br /> Seeing this in the 90s after a long absence, It was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has mainly made television shows since this movie was released ... and continues to act. It was also interesting to see a young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not have recognized if it had not been for this voice. <br /> <br /> I saw half of this The movie before boredom It came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciate you doing this VHS tape again in stereo. But it was a weak effort. This is an overrated movie in which "elites" think it is so "heavy" and "stimulating". That's silly. He just seemed "smart" because the rest of the 50s science fiction movies were so stupid. <br /> <br /> Some of the first scenes would have looked great on the widescreen, which I did not have on stage. moment of this writing. Maybe another look: this time in the 2.35: 1 wide screen transfer would make me change this revision.
