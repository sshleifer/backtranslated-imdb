I have always said that some works by their very nature can not be translated into the cinema, and this is a good example. <br /> <br /> As a play, this is a very funny farcical satire of the Catholic. Church, with a blade wit and a central character that is so incredibly unreal that we have to encourage it even as it begins to murder its parishioners (one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting that he had not sinned since his last confession, so it feels she is sending it directly to heaven). <br /> <br /> That's just an example of how far the work goes from reality, and in the world of theater, it works. However, that kind of enhanced reality rarely works in a movie, and it certainly does not work here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Brickman has put together an excellent cast that does a great job, but by presenting all this nonsense in a realistic way. The fashion of comedy becomes a tragedy and leaves you with a feeling of emptiness in the pit of your stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for a production of the play in its place, you will not be disappointed.
