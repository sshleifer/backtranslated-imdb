This film was a big disappointment in the direction, the intellectual style, the plot and in the way he treated his subject, painting. It is a slow motion film set as an episode of Wonder Years, however, with a surprising lack of depth. Nor does he deliver his message convincingly. <br /> <br /> The focus of the painting theme is very elitist, limited to vague and subjective terms such as "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in paintings of Bob-Ross-style kitsch landscapes. According to this film, good art can be achieved by applying basic color theory (such as primary school level) and many feelings. In parts, the movie is offensive, for example. at one point it is affirmed (rather, it is celebrated dancing at the tables) that people with mental disabilities are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition are useless 'trash' (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the movie could get such a high rating, then once again, so far there are not many people who qualified it, and they chose only for very high or very low grades.
