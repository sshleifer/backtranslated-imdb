While browsing the channels on Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His accent was breaking so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. Next, I was surprised to discover that this movie was made after I had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film reproduces the stereotypes, with the figure of the inspiring teacher. The girl who played with Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this movie won a prize? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we really wanted to measure our eyes after seeing this for only 10 seconds. We changed from "Kicking and screaming" to this, and we wanted to change again. We saw the 1995 children's classic "The Indian in the Cupboard" earlier in the evening, which also spoke about the Iroquois. The following line represents our desire to flee: "Take me outside, grab the earth." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to look".
