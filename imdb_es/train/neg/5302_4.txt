Dewaana as a film goes through the usual cliches. The man and the woman fall in love and get married, the husband is supposedly killed by a friend of the family who wants the fortune of his family, the women remarry and the surprise is surprising that the husband no.1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's Chandni and many others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri, like a villain, follows the movements and is nothing more than a standard Bollywood villain. The music of Nadeem Shravan is excellent, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through movements.
