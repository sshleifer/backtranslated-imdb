There is a key aspect to the film that Jobson seems to have forgotten: he has the ability to tell a story by showing it to him. You do not need to tell the audience what to think, because they will see it. The action here is interspersed with some of the heaviest narrations unleashed in the unsuspecting public: the purple prose of the delicate fifth formator. And it should be unnecessary because there is an excellent cast here and some visually beautifully composed and taken. Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed some support. And he may have been right, he lacks a basic credibility: the 70s in Edinburgh were not exactly full of beautiful smart girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a weak spot for a passing sociopath. From the too neat and new clothes that the character uses to the cod's intellectualism that tries to tie everything together, it is too artificial for my taste.
