Yes it is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to strip his actors and publicly show their secrets. Pintilie IS THE "emperor" naked, so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It is the great moment for someone to tell the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat locked in the body of an old man. His abundance of nude scenes does not have any artistic legitimacy. It is 100% visual perversion: it receives its kicks by having the actors undress and look at their volunteers. And if you do it in front of the audience, you may have problems! Did you know that, on the set of "Niki Ardelean", he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss by saying: "Oh, Coca, how I want to fuck you"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she was unspeakably ashamed, for her little satisfaction! And, as a worrying alarm about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences, many people are still so foolish in declaring these visual obscenities as "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to expose the truth of all this?
