It's interesting to see this series as a feature of MST3K, but for today's audience that's it. I was very surprised to see the year it was made in 1952. Considering that this fact alone makes this a solid (humble?) 2 in my book. Used cars do not even look contemporary, they look like things from the 1930s. Basically, is Cody (the salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh talks about an insult to everyone else, like the military), anyway, it's Cody, with his flying nipple suit against Graber and Daley, two stupid * ss men who carry pistols and an occasional lightning gun. Quite lame in its own right, enjoy. If you want to see a really good series, go to Flash Gordan, it is full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also a beautiful woman, this has NOTHING about that. And Flash was made about 15 years before this shit, so you can give it a little slack. Something done in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. Nuff said. give it a 6 if you see it as an episode of MST3K, those guys have a lot of fun with it; A pinch of the nipples here, a pinch there and I'm flying! And now, as an additional bonus, I bring you the song Commander Cody Theme, sung originally by Joel and his two character robots, Tom Servo and Crow, aboard the love satellite for episode eight The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> (Singing at the beginning of the credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR COMMANDER OF CODY SURVEILLANCE ... HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER OF THE REPUBLIC, <br /> <br /> HE IS IN PROBLEMS WEEK ... BUT HE HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE EDITION, <br /> <br /> ONLY A TWEAK OF ITS NIPPLES ... SEND IT FOR YOUR PATH, <br /> <br /> A PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACKAGE ... .. YOU WILL SAVE THE DAY, <br /> <br /> (JOEL SINGING) YOUR LABRADORA IS A BOXING RING ... WHEN MANY GUYS COME TO MIX, <br /> <br /> SOMEBODY ALWAYS KIDNAPPED IS ALLOWED. .. AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT, <br /> <br /> DRINK HIS TEE IN THE COFFEE OF AL ... AND FLUSH CABLE WITH WIRES, <br /> <br /> ARRIVE TO THE CROQUES AND FLY WITH HOOKS ... AND PAY STRONG FOREST, <br /> <br /> (CROW SINGING) <br /> <br /> MANY GUARDIANS BEWARE ... CODY THERE, <br /> <br /> YOU Like your hair is under your HELMUT ... AND BECAUSE WE CAN NOT THINK ABOUT A GOOD RHYME, <br /> <br /> THAT IS THE END OF THE SONG OF THE COMMANDER CODY THE SONG ... SO YOU FEEL AGAIN WITH A WILL OF GRANITE, <br /> <br /> AND SEE CHAPTER EIGHT, CAUSE THAT IS THE PLANET ENEMY
