I saw this movie by accident yesterday at a movie theater. I had some hopes for the film because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The movie starts well, since at first it seems to be a good thriller. Quickly, despite the fact that the film becomes a mess with uninteresting plots, the characters never materialize and nobody in the audience cares (like Marjoke) and a terrible edition. The film has faded to black bits that are too long, a messy chronology that jumps from one side to another and many scenes that simply add nothing to the story and could have been dropped easily. After suffering the story, you will be treated to one of the worst endings I have seen in a long time. It should also be mentioned that the movie has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to if you watch many Dutch movies. It's hard to mention anything good about this movie. About a third of the audience had already left the cinema in the middle of the movie and I did not hear a kind word when the movie ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. It really destroyed any faith he had left in the Dutch film industry.
