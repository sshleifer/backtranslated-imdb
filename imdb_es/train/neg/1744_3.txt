I saw the Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of the same name) a long time ago. The basic story of garam masala is the same, but told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by the routine ones found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of the Hindi audience) .. . <br /> <br /> I have not seen the original in English. But I had really enjoyed the movie Malayalam (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a comedy that was divided aside, back then. Of course, the performance of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the cook) was very natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> I am probably very impressed by the Malayalam movie that I can not tolerate even the smallest faults. His Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overcome. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job, but does not get anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But overall it's fine, if one compares it to other recent Hindi comedy movies.
