After seeing this movie, I was truly disappointed, not because of the actors, the story or the direction, I was disappointed with the ads for this movie. <br /> <br /> The advances suggested that the battalion "has chosen the third exit" apart from surrendering or dying (the Polish information even confused that they had the option of being killed by their own artillery or German weapons, even translated the title as incorrect as "battalion out of place"). This has tickled in the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is simply to sit and count corpses followed by sitting and counting corpses ... Then I started thinking "hey, this story can not be that simple. .. I bet that this smart officer will find a clever way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, he did not, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And I also. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real events of the First World War, so the writers could not make much use of their imagination, but I even thought that this movie seemed really challenging and even a little boring And as I wrote in the first place, it's not the actors', writers' or directors' fault, their marketing staff has raised my expectations above the level at which this film could cope.
