['This little show is obviously a small prequel / spin off of the original series. <br /><br /> Compared to the live action series, this show is total shit. The live action show had smart jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically a bittersweet and bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest, but I think maybe the children will hate this shit. <br /><br /> The plot of each episode is, basically, only that Sabrina has some stupid and useless dillemma and uses magic to solve it. That is basically the idea of each episode. The strangest episode was when Sabrina used magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. Then, Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvery to become his slave. This leads to a strange, but rather interesting scene, where Gem says &quot;just love me for now&quot; and Harvey gets down on his knees and starts kissing his feet as if he were a god. (which is quite correct since it is his mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.']
