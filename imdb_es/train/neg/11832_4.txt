From the creators of Shrek ???????? ... Well, that caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now, Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means that Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all those special effects were extremely good, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was only for children. Seriously, it's not possible for adults to really love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were a lot of jokes for adults. I bet kids do not understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Even though I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I am completely disappointed. 4/10
