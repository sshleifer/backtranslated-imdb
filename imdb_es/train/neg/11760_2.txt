Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First of all, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele stars in each of them. I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT IS MISSING! It would have been a comedy for the girl raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) It's fine for popcorn television, but it was not credible in this movie (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOVE STORY? The movie was supposed to be about the rise of a young man to military power, not the captain of the slave ship who is getting nervous with the English maid in search of her father ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for this Movie, I would have to call the police, because that would be a crime!
