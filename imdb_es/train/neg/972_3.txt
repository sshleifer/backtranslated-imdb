This was a disappointing horror movie about a young brat and her nightmares. For a horror movie or "thriller" and exaggerations, it is too docile. There are only a few tense moments here, not as close as they should have been to a movie of this genre. Even those "tense" scenes were not much. The music made them more dramatic than they really were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, which is why elitist critics label this "horror movie for a person who thinks". Well, if you think about it, I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion as me: a waste of money at the video rental store. <br /> <br /> Summary: a yawn that offers a nasty main character. and in general bad performance. Very overrated and certainly not what is advertised.
