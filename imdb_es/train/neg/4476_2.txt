I just watched this movie premiere on MTV. I must say that this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I was left with the feeling that there were many holes in the plot. There is not a nice character in this adaptation due to the bad performance. I just find that all the characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, the love of Cate and Heath seems very incestuous. They seem more like brothers and not like lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie due to some actors that I respected and enjoyed watching in previous films, but as I said, it is extremely difficult to like any of the characters. The performance of Katherine Heigl was horrible, which was a complete surprise. It was terrible for being Edward's ill-intentioned older sister, and there were not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne to even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did it well and it was great to see him in something recent, and even though his character was a little bit crazy, he was the only person he sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but they went crazy and dramatic. <br /> <br /> I just did not really enjoy this movie or the music it contained. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that little appearance did not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job of convincing me that this was a movie that was not. I just imagined something so completely different.
