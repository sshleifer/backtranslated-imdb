This movie was rented by a friend. Your choice is usually good. I read the cover first and I expected a good movie. Although it was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer But I could not think of any horror when I saw the movie. It was a boring movie, <br /> <br /> not very entertaining. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was once again a pleasure to behold. But that's it. We (all four) <br /> <br /> are a bit disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> judge yourself.
