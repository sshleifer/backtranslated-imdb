Even worse than David Lynch's worst "confusaton", "Brain Dead" does not make any sense at all. The shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bounces as if they were in a cartoon of "Tom and Jerry" in acid. There is despicable development of character. Simply start climbing the "strange scale", until reaching the climax in total chaos. Do not let yourself get caught up in this because of the excellent actors mentioned above. They are not given anything to work with, and they will wonder what is happening over the course of the 85 minutes. I strongly recommend that you avoid "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless you're in to disperse your brain in complete nonsense. - MERK
