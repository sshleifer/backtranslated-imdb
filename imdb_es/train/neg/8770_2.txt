This movie was the longest movie and the safest record. I had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I think nobody had the guts to do something like that. <br /> <br /> The film as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war, but the problem is that there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring. <br /> <br /> There are even too many cinematographic freedoms like killing people with knives, I wonder which one the soldier does that? <br /> <br /> The direction of JP Dutta pales in front of BORDER The music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the great cast, Ajay Devgan stands, Saif is very good in his part and is also his first film with kareena, Abhishek is nice Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is fine Akshaye Khanna does his part well the rest is passable Rani is good, Esha is fine the rest is passable
