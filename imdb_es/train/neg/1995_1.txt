Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it was not even worth it. It seems to be of poor quality and is in the public domain, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Neagle, despite her glory, awards and reputation, is a British home girl who can not sing or dance. or act <br /> <br /> Some of the best actors of the old Hollywood characters shown here must have thought they were making a classic. The director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. I was wrong. It was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after World War II. Their "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than their musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a couple of famous songs are included and none is well presented. Skip this one and find the one who stars Doris Day. At least you get a real comedy and a professional dance style!
