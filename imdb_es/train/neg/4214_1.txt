Having lost only a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of that time with total disbelief, I can give this garbage the prize of the year turkey, no problem. To say that the plot was incredible is a great underestimation. Frankly, I'm lost by the words to describe this complete gut. Not only the characters are completely and without appearance of originality (this kind of things have been done much better in dozens of "serial killer films"), but the performance was serious. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, I hope you get your money back. Believe me friends, there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go see.
