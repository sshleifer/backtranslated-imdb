I've seen this movie today for the first time and I've never heard of it before, probably because of its poor message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the address itself is quite good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is great. But that just does not make a movie. No history, no message behind beautiful talents exploited. <br /> <br /> Or I have to make people remember, the art of a director is not only your vision, but also knowing how to tell a story. And this is what is missing in the full 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a rating of 4 simple.
