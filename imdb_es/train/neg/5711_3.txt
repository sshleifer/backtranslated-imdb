National Treasure is so overrated and overrated as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones." People who have compared this film to the classic trilogy of Indian Jones have taken seriously their rocker. <br /> <br /> I can not really figure out what kind of audience this movie was aimed at. Maybe the preteen audience likes it, but I found it absolutely ridiculous. I also can not imagine that adults or young adults find that this movie is so great. In short: it's fine, at best. <br /> <br /> National Treasure has no imagination or inspiration, and borrows what it has from "The Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 and transmitting this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to steal the Declaration of Independence so easily and run throughout Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (even if it never hurts once), while fighting the "bad guys" and experiencing what which is supposed to be an "action without stopping" is absurd. I especially loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube lying in the middle of a busy road, while the cars pass without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the episode of "Brady Bunch", in which they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except, that episode of Brady Bunch was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a huge treasure that nobody believes there is a burial in a secret ruin of the United States is extravagant. Literally, there are thousands of "priceless" undiscovered items in this treasure. Yeah sure!! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> Worse yet, the speed and accuracy with which Cage finds himself and realizes what are supposed to be "difficult" clues to these ancient enigmas are pre-infamous! Oh humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and the other actors in "National Treasure" are as stiff, wooden and flat as they come. However, when you work with such a bad dialogue, it is difficult to criticize 100% of the actor for that. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is a movie that is good to see once. I can not recommend it beyond that and I would definitely NOT buy it over, extravagant treasure hunt. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you must see it first .......
