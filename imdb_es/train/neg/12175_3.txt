Why review good movies when you can review "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is very bad. I can only imagine the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, throwing extras with a silly monster makeup to the poor and sufferer Tim Thomerson. The families of the stars actually show up to play the cameos, probably because the Full Moon could not afford the "real" extras. Lick effects, lame sets and a script so complicated that it would take eons to untie all the knots, this must be a classic of the Trancers! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... rules. Keep in mind that this is the same thing that I say about "Trancers IV". I say it because it's true. What can you beat when you see an old guy in a raincoat cut the zombies and then ask them questions like: "Do not worry, ladies, they are biodegradable"? Well, many things could be better, but still this is still a good thing. <br /> <br /> My only important reservation is Megan Ward, who really sucks. She is a terrible rival for the character of Helen Hunt; both are small candies, and would have been more effective if they contrasted a little more. Oh, well, you can not have everything. At least, the wonderful device of the "long second clock" plot is back in place, and we have more of Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh wait a minute, have a rival in the David Ogden Steirs form in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> Lately I have not seen this, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick escapes twice during the final battle. Hurray for the terrible continuity! Only one of the many highlights of this good movie.
