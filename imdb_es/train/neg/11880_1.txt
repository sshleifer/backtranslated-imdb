Office work, especially in this era of computers, multifunctional photocopiers, e-mail, voice mail, postal mail and "temps", is a territory full of satirical possibilities, a vein previously exploited in films such as "Clockwatchers" and offices, 'and with great success. However, this latest addition to the temp / humor group, `Haiku Tunnel ', directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, does not live up to its predecessors, and leaves the laughter somewhere outside the door, waiting for the opportunity to sneak in Unfortunately for the audience, that opportunity never comes; So what you get is a good try, but as the man said, there are no cigars. <br /> <br /> As the narrator / star of the film, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth), points out in the initial pictures (in a monologue delivered directly to the camera), this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of "San Francisco". It is an innovative disclaimer, if not very imaginatively presented, and not so fun. However, it is a harbinger of what follows, all of which, like the disclaimer, simply is not so funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who relies on work. as 'temp'. It is a job that suits him, and gives him time to write a little about his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does a pretty good job the first day, and Shelby sends Chief Secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go. The idea of ​​working full time for the same company, however, initially causes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but he gives in and signs for the position. He's nervous about that, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temperature), and if things get very difficult, he has seventeen important letters he has written, that now only has to be sent by mail, to rely on it (he has been holding them up because mail is the easy part, and he needs that 'something easy to do' in the reserve, in case everything is too much for him). These are "important" letters, however, and at the end of the week, Kornbluth still has them reserved, on his desk. And it does not take a genius to realize that when Shelby finds out, the days of Kornbluth as the blond boy will be over. And fast. <br /> <br /> The Kornbluth brothers, who not only directed, but along with John Bellucci also wrote the script for this film, should have taken out a page from the Ben Stiller Comedy Book, where it says "If you play it right , they will laugh ". But, they did not, and the audience will not. Because in comedy, even looking at it in the most objective way possible, when the main character (as well as most secondary characters, in this case) `plays 'funny-- as in,` he knows' he is being funny-- he is never And that is exactly what Kornbluth does here; so instead of being "funny", he is insincere and pretentious, a serious error of judgment on the part of the Kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie. <br /> <br /> When trying to discern exactly why this movie does not work, it's two basic reasons: the address, which, if not necessarily "bad", is at least careless; and second, the performances, starting with Josh Kornbluth. Quite simply, Kornbluth seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin, both use self-critical humor very effectively. Apparently, Kornbluth has an ego that simply does not allow himself to be put that way; He seems to have the need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is actually much smarter than Kornbluth, the character. And being unable to overcome that does he, as well as the movie. Instead of giving the millions of office workers who can see this movie to someone they can relate to or identify with, Kornbluth affects in a condescending way that only serves to alienate the people he is trying to reach. So, everything boils down to a case of misdirection and unconvincing, and when you consider that the script itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich topic), it's easy to understand why what this one just does not fly. <br /> <br /> The only one that saves the film's flair is Warren Keith's performance as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and who - in itself - is pretty comical. However, its effectiveness diminishes, since Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which automatically cancels his positive contributions to the project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not completely memorable; at least they make their scenes visible, and Overman even manages to raise Kornbluth's performance, if only for a moment. But still not enough to save the day or the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy, the mail clerk)), with a cameo by Harry Shearer as the Orientation Leader, a role that asks for an answer to the question: "What were you thinking when you accepted this?" In any work environment, there will always be situations that arise in one way or another, inevitably, they will become food for someone's comic cannon, and the films that represent those situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) can even become classics in their own right. 'Haiku Tunnel', however, will undoubtedly remain a long time between them, since their destiny is elsewhere, in a kingdom known only as: 'Darkness'. I rate this one 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
