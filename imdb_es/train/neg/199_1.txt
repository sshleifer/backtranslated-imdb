This is a terrible movie, a terrible script, a bad direction and a pointless ending. Also, bad performances, except for Clancy Brown, who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Seeing this movie was a purgatory: you do it to download enough bad movie karma to see a good one later. <br /> <br /> The film presents a father and a son who seem unable to see. possibly they have been related. The male leadership part is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the points of the plot a mile away. The actions of the female protagonist and that of her brother, the policeman, do not make sense either. Therefore, an important action on your part at the end of the movie does not make sense for the script.
