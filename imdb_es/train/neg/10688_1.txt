I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought that, with all the good actors, it would be worth watching. I could not believe it when the movie ended and I had no idea what had happened ... I was angry because I could have used that time doing something else ... I tried to find out everything, but I really had no idea. Thanks to those who discovered it and explained it ... well or badly, it's better than not knowing anything! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times away? How did the First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would eventually discover the truth. Does this mean that we are going to be submitted to End Game 2?
