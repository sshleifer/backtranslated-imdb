MAIN LEAGUE: RETURN TO MINORS (1998) Â½ * <br /> <br /> Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes. Rating PG-13 (for the language and some violence) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in the new comedy of John Warren "LEAGUE MAIN: BACK TO THE MINORS "there is a funny scene. It consists of a sequence in which an enraged coach throws a baseball hard against the wall behind him only to hit the cement and bounce and hit him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few phrases from a single line, it's all this movie has to offer ... enough. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally damaged, characteristically underdeveloped, predictable and poorly written, it is also simply bad. Even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with everything they got. It's so familiar that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times should the same movie about sports be made? The last years we saw this same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver", and as bad as the movie was, this is even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see it on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So, who is this movie for? Teenagers? Higher? People who are so desperate for entertainment that they would rent something like this? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others like it, has a basic point that it tries to make: teamwork conquers everything. Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. Too bad we've seen it, and many times we've seen it so many times, we have so little talent and intelligence that its cheerleaders are men in dancing costumes. Where the crazy announcers form their own "friends' comedy routine" muttering a line of themselves like "Chupan", "This kid's fastball is timed with an hourglass", "This guy retired from the ball by a time to find something you missed - maybe it was your mind, "" Someone needs a nap "and" ever see a sunset as beautiful as that work ". Where the characters have so little meaning to each other that we never know them by name. And where the unique and sincere conference scene about teamwork is so unfamiliar that it's almost fun. <br /> <br /> "The Major Leagues of Return to the Children" are so bad; It stops its beaten end right in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is back, they are about to win and - the power is going. I was thinking for a minute that this piece of junk had reached a conclusion, but in reality, its final fake scene exists only to add minutes to the execution time. The film basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw up so many putrefying jokes that are not funny. There is another kind of funny dialogue line in which a coach and a player talk to each other about why a long-time gardener is no longer loved in that position. The coach's response: "You're too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is to die for him. But that scene certainly does not make this movie worthy of your time, and it certainly is not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here is another terrible entry in this genre of film, another that is doomed with its own script, which has not been seen before, and another that is so familiar that it seems once again deja vu . <br /> <br />
