This miserable movie shows that not even some of the best of Gollywood can salvage a real landfill deposit ... <br /> <br /> I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad in this effort, but that would require more time and I 'I've already lost 91 minutes watching ... IT. <br /> <br /> Look at it now, after the death of Brando, shows how tragic the life of one of our best actors had become. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. Goodbye.
