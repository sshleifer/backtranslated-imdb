I could not believe how little and useless this was. Basically, there's nothing to laugh about in the movie, there are almost no scenes that interest you in the rest of the movie. This movie attracted some huge stars, but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves should have taken some acting lessons a few years after this movie before looking at The Matrix. Uma Thurman seemed very simple and humble. Luckily I got this movie at a very low price because it is certainly not a movie to remember for any good reason. I will not write anything about the history of the film, but as you should know, she is destined to be the most famous hiker in America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2/10. Before watching this movie, I was wondering why this movie only has a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Do not buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
