I was very disappointed in this movie. I thought that "Scary Movie" although it was not a great movie was very good and fun. "Scary Movie 2", on the other hand, was boring, not funny and, sometimes, simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The parody of Exorcist / Amityville was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I must admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen some of the movies that this parody does not look like the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the moment, which ruined some of what could have been good jokes. The scenes and jokes get too long. <br /> <br /> In addition, the same jokes are repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok, it was fun the first time and maybe even the second one. But it kept repeating itself to the point of annoying. The routine between the type of wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it repeated and ended up being stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were even repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been expecting to give her boyfriend sex for so long, she essentially had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he "creamy". But this time it was out of place and it was not funny. <br /> <br /> Bathing and sexual humor in general were more fun and timely the first time. However, the scat humor was excessive and quite unnecessary in the second movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) which in my opinion was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot was one of my favorites from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . They have a much more comical ability than endless jokes.
