The '60s is an occasionally entertaining movie, most of this entertainment comes from laughing at the movie. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take, for example, the change between black and white and color. If done well, this could have been quite effective, but because it was done poorly, it became a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; Much of the movie had a strange feeling. The performance was not extremely bad for a movie made for television, but again it was shameful at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ended up being confusing. How did this family end in some way in many of the great events during the 1960s? The ending was too boring for my tastes; Because I was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out well in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time in the 60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I saw this in class, and not in my own time. I think I can say for sure that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts in the movie. I hope you follow my advice and stay away from this.
