... but the key word here is "generally". I am known for worshiping movies that EVERYONE thinks are stupid. But in the world of films rated B, ESTA has an Absolutely ridiculous Z rating. What I respect most of my favorite B-rated movies is that they do not take themselves too seriously. Filmmakers like that treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy subject. However, I get the impression that the producers of this film took the road seriously, as if they were putting together a 10-star classic, with bad attempts at touching lines and silly camera shots. However, despite all this, I STILL gave 4 out of 10 stars, since I am biased towards movies like this. However, if you are a B-rated fan, I would try too hard to find this one.
