I'm here again at your local mall (of course, because that's where the high school kids go!) To show how horrible "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is! To show how bad this DCOM joke is, this is ... <br /> <br /> ... let's take these four sumo wrestlers and put them in this photo booth. What ... cozy! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How horrible is it ????? It's so bad that Disney Channel wastes their money, once again, with those exciting but decisive 10-second promotions, causing viewers to ask themselves: "WHEN WILL IT BE ESTABLISHED?" And then, suddenly, when it turns ON, on the one hand, this not only got a TV rating higher than normal, but it was only seen once. Oh no!!!!! Once everyone! Also, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, I will NOT go any further with what's there ... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
