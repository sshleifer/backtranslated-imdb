I will be brief, since I know that I do not need to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously attracts some, but I found it surprisingly insipid. almost the beginning The film did very little to make any of the characters enjoyable and the story sometimes became so complicated that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I discovered that "Alive" by Kitamura was nothing, a boring, extremely boring drama, disguised as a science fiction movie that invites reflection. I felt as if I was attracted to see this movie, based on its fascinating premise and its super exciting cover. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Pass it for the much more enjoyable effort of Kitamura "Versus" or his 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, I'm always ready for a good thinker of the man movie, but of course this was not the case. There was not a single moment when I really worried about a unique event that takes place in this film that is too boring and full of dialogues. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
