Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the western front, this silly and superficial version of the war is far removed from its much better contemporary. This represents the funniest war ever fought, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see something of battle, it is scarce: Does an enemy plane fly over? Shoot down (in a shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill it before it goes off. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they surrender happily. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Shy, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
