Do not even ask me why I saw this! The only excuse I can think of is that I was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for the words, the movie that is, not the bronchitis. The performance is deplorable, Richard Grieco mocks him as a serial killer who fires shots and fires with a penchant for knocking out cops. Nick Mancuso telephones in a performance as the policeman on his way and Nancy Allen manages to put on the only sympathetic role in the entire movie. The script is grim, dotted with clich√© lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco purrs to each of his victims. Terrible. Avoid.
