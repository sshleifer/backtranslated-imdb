There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's leave that part of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underestimated and underappreciated movie. Cat was ... well, just horrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was chosen because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and without fear engages with exaggerated and extravagant characters. Mike Myers leaned back in his old bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers? Kids will not mind, and the demographics of Austin Powers are not going to spy on this movie. So, what was the study thinking about? <br /> <br /> Apparently, the cat was also related to Linda Richmond. We can talk? Why a New York accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish Scotsman. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit before giving in and said "as long as you do not say fahklempt 'you can keep the accents". Meyers never seemed to find any kind of comfort, be it with disguise, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes, the few that were, were rude and inappropriate for the age. When Myers takes a hoe from the garden and gives it to the camera: "dirty ho", everything but the hoop of the shot was missing, and even that would not have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created 'Whoville' clearly had a hand in the creation of the city and the houses in 'Gato'. The sets and accessories were very attractive, which gave the viewer a much-needed distraction from poor writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was something fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to realize that he was in a movie based on Dr. Seuss's classic and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat must be neutered and never allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, there is no sequel.
