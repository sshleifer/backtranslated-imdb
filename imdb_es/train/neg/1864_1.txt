I may not be a critic, but this is what I think of this movie. Well, I just saw the movie in cinemax and, above all, I just have to say how much I hate the plot. I mean, what scares a snowman besides small children? Second, it's pretty bloody, but I bet the movie has such a low budget. They probably used ketchup so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS PUMP !!! Good try and the sequel will suck the double.
