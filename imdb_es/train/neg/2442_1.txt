I do not know why I keep doing this to myself! I still defend Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that I should get more credit and opportunities ... and then they hit you in the head with trash like this! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst that has been done in the Dutch-speaking countries. It is a Dutch attempt to create our own franchise of terror, based clearly on the classics of the United States such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers scored very high with this, but they really fell low. Intensive care became an embarrassing product for everyone involved and, therefore, a true cult movie here. It is almost impossible to catch an original copy of this and it is only shown on special occasions, such as "The Night of Disaster". For exactly 5 minutes, intensive care tries to tell a story and even create a plot ... then it becomes a movie slash 's stalk' n stalk with little sense and very funny, although very hilarious and cheap, make-up effects. The performance of the entire cast is abominable, although there are some respected names involved. The main male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy could be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, presenter of television programs and idol of many young girls. However, he never mentions what he starred in. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself that intensive care never happened.
