I can not believe that people like Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger have been involved in this piece of garbage! The script is so poorly written and the direction is so weak (both by the same person) that it is difficult to find more characters of a dimension in a movie. The dialogues are so boring that this so-called thriller laughed at the few fools who entered the theater. The configuration is complicated, inviting you to believe that you are going to see a chilling thriller and suddenly it becomes the most stupid chase movie. The character of Bassinger is so stupid, he actually stops to shout to God "Where are you!" so that people after her can continue, and then take a leak !!!! And then apparently he went into the smallest forest in the world, I mean, he runs all over the place and the killers never lose sight of him, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, is that really the best writing people in Hollywood can find that they spend millions to produce it.
