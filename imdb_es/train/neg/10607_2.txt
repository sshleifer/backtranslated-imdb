Jean Claude Van Damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel to Universal Soldier. But did that movie save him? I think he's going to hell, after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the bad guy in the movie. Fear, huh? But it is not as scary as the performance (the details are the following). <br /> <br /> Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (I do not remember the name ... well, it does not matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscular men. Of course they are the new universal soldiers. More muscels, less brain (like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights against Goldberg, but then the "mission" is aborted. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government in the new Universal Soldier project (whoever has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unnatural thing that the character of Van Dammes could do). But it is a sequel. And a "story" has to emerge. Oh, I forgot it. He has a daughter. Very important for "history". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer listens to a conversation about turning it off and abandoning the project. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the installation BUT the computer sends some soldiers chasing him (he wants Van Damme as a soldier, because he is the best (seriously?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, which was always a silly phrase to the public before they applauded him. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "story", Van Damme tries to rescue his daughter (from his wife, the reporter in the first film). It's a final show in which Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (see for yourself, it's too much fun to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not see it. But if you do, take a sixpack with you!
