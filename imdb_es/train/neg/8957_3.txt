Amazing. Do you get more foolish than this? No way. The stupidity of this film would embarrass even Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had a mediocre dialogue and the second an incorrect dialogue, then this has a cretinous dialogue. Amazing. But this time, history has also been reduced to the level of dialogue. Despite the acting and the dialogue, I liked the first two movies, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The completely moronic plot, obviously, comes from the pen of a frustrated left end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if such leftists realize how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship they are. In this movie obviously point to the United States? a democracy Why do not they attack Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-military movies? Of course, most of these places are unlikely to produce a cube like this in the short term, but that is irrelevant. It's obvious: garbage writers like this really admire this type of regimen, whether they're aware of it or not. I would even dare to say that ANYONE who strongly attacks the foreign policies of the USA. UU All the time, you have antidemocratic beliefs in your core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: aside from being so implausible that it's not even funny anymore, the film has many obvious ilogicalities. For example, for some reason, the two men who supervise the cube have done so for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism involved in the project, however, the first one suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea about human nature will see through this idiocy. Or how about that cretin character, the evil bureaucrat who speaks as if he were in a bad comedy by Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses all seriousness and, therefore, any possibility of being exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
