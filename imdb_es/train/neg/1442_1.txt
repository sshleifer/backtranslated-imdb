This is the worst shit imaginable. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The creators of this worthless film do not follow it closely. Well, the old novels are not sacred and making free versions is fine with me if you have ideas of your own. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and diluted cliches, you should stick to the original. If they had done that, this movie would have been at least twice as good even with the worst actors and if it had been filmed inside a studio with cardboard huts. But there is no imagination, only fatigue. This must be bought or seen only by collectors of Victorian novels turned into movies. <br /> <br /> Just a suggestion, and not a spoiler, to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has happened. and what to expect if you decide to watch this on television or, God forbid, spend money to buy it. Gagool, an evil old witch in the book and some forerunner of Gollum has become a good girl!
