This was the worst low budget horror movie I've seen. I'm an open-minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies, I'm looking specifically for some good underestimated horror movies. They are always good to laugh, I think I know, I've seen many. But this movie was so terrible that it was not worth laughing. I was considering turning it off in the first five minutes ... what I probably should have done. There's nothing good about it, first of all, the camera team stinks A $$. The introduction was stupid as was the ending. The acting and the special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, DO NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
