I just can not believe how many people compare this favorably with the first movie. I was moved to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film. The dialogue is atrocious and nothing as authentic or convincing as the original film. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, the image of the French police is ridiculous and the characterization of Doyle a mile away from the first film. <br /> <br /> How many anti-drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment arrive? The ease with which Doyle finds his boy is simply pathetic. As all the French policemen were only drinking coffee until Doyle appears in the United States and does REAL police work. What a joke Try to go to a foreign city and unearth the biggest stumbling blocks of the place with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A truly horrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
