The use of looted images of the Planet of the dinosaurs, this video capture (except the stolen images) concerns a group of people who shot into space and land on a dinosaur planet that is ... do not wait, it's really Earth . It's a five-minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. A bit better than Chickboxer (another from the Bad Movie Police series), which has a nostalgic home movie together with good stolen effects, this film is still an impossible job to achieve. I have left to reflect on the question: are we becoming so uncreative that we are now looting the old movies not only for the plot but also for the footage that does not match? It is clear that low-budget producers are becoming so desperate that they will really give us anything to take our money.
