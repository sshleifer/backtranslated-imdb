The film was completely misleading and the additional material confirmed my impression that it was a thief from Joeseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the river is replaced by a road and the ship becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <Claims made outside the box of the DVD were a manifest fraud to take this invented death of a journalist and present it as a real fact <br /> <br /> while some parties have Muslims supporting the 9/11 attacks for the treatment of Muslims around the world by the United States. UU <br /> <br /> I alerted the video store that the film should be removed from its "Documentary" section and placed in the war drama area for quasi-fictional accounts of real events.
