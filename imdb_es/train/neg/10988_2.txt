If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I did read the book. Whoever once wrote the screen ruined the plot. There are so many changes, that it was not really worthy of the Title. Changes of character, changes in the plot, changes in the timeline ... <br /> <br /> Who was Henry and the researcher first? They were not in the story. Henry had something of Mitch's personality, but Mitch was not a cop. No, you did it so Roz helped "sink" his body and used it as Zenia's blackmail against Roz. The real blackmail was that Roz thought that Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. His son was also being blackmailed because he hid being gay from his mother. His son was not even mentioned in the story. I do not think it was her lover either, Roz's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. Actually I was with Zenia first while I was in college. The apartment painted black was his idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, they become fast friends. Tony hides his love for West. Then Zenia went west, with money from Tony, then West and Tony got together. Finally, marry, at some point West leaves Tony again for Zenia for a short time. Only to be broken heart again. Then come back with Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test document for Zenia. Now that I was a professor at the university, I did not want to let her out. I will say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Charis's character was blond, not that it really matters. Zenia did not cheat on her for having cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father, was a skier in the Vietnam War. Eventually, after Charis took care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an adventure just below Charis's nose while taking care of both. Then Zenia gives Billy to the government and leaves with him on the ferry. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia did not die when she was cut into pieces ... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never knew) from the balcony And landed in a fountain. He had almost pure grade heroin in his blood and was likely to take something he did not know and fall down when he had OD. She was also really dying of cancer this time. <br /> <br /> It did not show any of the memories of childhood or anything that made the characters love the reader. The book was reduced to his bare bones. Then it is done in the vision of someone else. Why could not you just write your own story in line with what you did in the movie? It was different enough, and I'm sure more could have been done.
