In modern-day Europe, life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options that Melania reluctantly takes. She attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, and pays her more and more money for the time he spends with her until he finally wants to buy her directly. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments and usually transmits it as a piece of luggage without feelings of her own. However, we are in the territory of "modern art cinema", so conventions such as the narrative structure, illuminating the subject so that it can be seen, the camera techniques that contribute to the action instead of being distracted and can be abandoned a loosely consistent plot. Most of the time I had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did I care. People started leaving the screening almost before the last newcomers arrived and I do not think I've seen so many people leave. <br /> <br /> The images are important for the director: the characters emerge or disappear slowly in a dark screen, we obtain prolonged shots of nothing in particular and a scene of sex takes place in infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, the sex scenes were extraordinarily common; The missionary positions between naked people in the bed abounded and there were no drugs or related rarities. But perhaps these days is ordinary is not conventional. <br /> <br /> In general, almost without merit. <br /> <br />
