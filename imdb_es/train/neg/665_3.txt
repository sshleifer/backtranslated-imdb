In Bridgeport, upset high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenage girl Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she is a witness that he murdered his family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better, but she is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad hotel for the party. But psychopath Richard escaped from prison and is staying on the same floor of the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing his friends and hotel staff who cross his path. <br /> <br /> The forgettable bar "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad performance by Johnathon Schaech in the role of a demented assassin. The predictable script is amazing, since it is possible to predict what will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
