You want to see the movie "THE Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not that movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here seem to be written by fake third parties (poorly disguised). The people who made this movie seem to be trying to synthesize a false interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a well done mockumentary. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The movie is so petty that I can not imagine that someone familiar with the subject finds it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the one being cheated in this way, you should hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its great satire of taboo subjects, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
