Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would like to see. I also did not like the movie when an Australian man trafficked drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug trafficking. I would not like to go to that country no matter what happens after watching this movie. In fact, this movie sucks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country that I tolerate. I also prefer to stay in the United States. After watching some of the movies in the theater, including the false accusation of drug trafficking, I left the cinema and they gave me back the money because I can not tolerate this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who could be a drug dealer, forget it!
