The charming Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the "I do's" with her fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry still has to move on and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very concerned. Chloe makes arrangements for Henry to talk to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley must get in touch with Kate's spirit in hopes of helping Henry get on with his life. When the psychic begins to feel attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost seems to cut the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the essence of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally I thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs as always a pain in the ass. Still, this movie was exaggerated.
