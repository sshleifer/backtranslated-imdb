The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead wandering woman is told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and without meaning. Mona, the lazy, moody and addicted to drugs, is not nice and Bonnaire does little to make it interesting. Although there is a pretentious dialogue that tries to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, which involves some random characters, becomes boring after a while, making it seem much longer than its execution time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive homeless young woman does not attract more attention from men.
