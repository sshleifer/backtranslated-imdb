This is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the kidnapped daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that it is worth supporting him as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere, but he's surrounded by politicians and their healers, shaking their wives and supported only by the friendly Uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper appears. Some rodeo shots might have animated things, like "Misfits", but there was not so much luck with this one. Later, Gary enters a formal dinner, in which Merle presides, and, although he is invited to sit down and join the group, he reads a lecture about his snobbery. Where did this sudden eloquence of the cowboy come from? The most unbearable scene in the film is a ghost party that Gary celebrates at home without finishing by his absent wife, Merle. It will never end? One to avoid.
