First of all, I will not tell you WHY I rented this movie, since I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is very similar to any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. Of course, there is an important person on the plane and the kidnapper looking for revenge. The sad thing is that some of the methods to stop the kidnappers have already been used in other films. Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> Although it is Ice-T (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts to ACT while not busy putting the "c" again in front of the rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less surprising Kim Oja as an air hostess who is "surprisingly" OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers, who naturally returns to pursue them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave my favorite part of the movie, when a kidnapper used a PLASTIC MOLD to fly a door lock ... BRIGHT. <br /> <br /> The argument was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The script: atrocious. It got to the point where I could say something, what I felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding special effects ... the only special thing about this film is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title: the DID movie took place in the air. But due to the less than stellar performances, the only fury in the film was that of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to even separate a movie, just because it's bad. Please, save yourself, do not choose this.
