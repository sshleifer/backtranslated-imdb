Let's be honest; a lame child who dies and his soul is transferred to a scarecrow. It's not going to happen neva! OMFG This stupid and loser child who can not fend for himself gets a drunken bastard to pass his mother's ass. Just when he dies, look at the scarecrow and let his spirit enter the scarecrow. The drunk covered up his death making him look suicidal and thought he had got away with it. Later we see that they take him out of the trailer and then win another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter that included the drunk who calls him the loser and the scarecrow who bounces with "You need to know, loser!" The scarecrow moves away from the building, calls it "daddy" and then decapitates the poor man. We can see how this incredible film develops from that. He is going to kill many people, later. Mainly he kills the people who made him have a hard time in RL and he is going to kill people at random, just for laughing. There is no laughter here. It also adds a punchline to each death. Every time he killed someone, he made some karate throws and finished everything with one of his characteristic punches. In the case of someone who had hearing problems, he would say "Here, have an ear of corn!" Then push it in the ass. Or we can take an example from the movie! He just killed a policeman and was on his way to kill the only person who had defended him. His father, the sheriff, shouted to the madman to stop and he said: "Hey, stay a while!" and threw a dagger that threw him to the chest and nailed him to a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two guys and launched the auction line "I have to split!" and he killed two guys by putting a scythe in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to put cream on my pants. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, do not be gay.
