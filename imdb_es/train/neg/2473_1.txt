If my grandmother made movies, they probably would do much better than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are fine. Especially the mother is a good actress and the child also proves to be very good, especially in the scenes in which he is supposed to be scary. But does the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script? The script does not have an evolutionary atmosphere to become a suspense thing. If you like being chased by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise, stay at home and sleep. oh ... actually there was something funny: the movie is from 2001 but we did not realize because the image is so bad (as in mini-dv) and the cars are very old (like 70 and 80).
