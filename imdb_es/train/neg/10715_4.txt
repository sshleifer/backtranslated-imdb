What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never got going. There was a bit of excitement when we discovered that Angie is not really pregnant, then we discovered that she is, after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually contributes a lot to a movie, was frightening and his entire character was not even close to being important for this movie, apart from making it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a drama with comic elements. I think if the movie did this, it could have been a lot of fun, since both actresses are pretty funny in their own way and here, sitting, I can think of many scenarios that would have been a riot.
