The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than boys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. The girl from Jersey goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration of not being lucky, listen to some girls celebrating the $ 300 they won the night before. She gets an audition at the bar where they work and surprise! The place is completely full of "two year olds" that open up when you see the girls dancing. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are nice, especially Cammie (the part of the "fashion coordinator" was cute) and the doorman, but let's be honest, the drama was horrible and completely ridiculous from the beginning. Violet and her father seemed too ridiculous as they interacted throughout the film. And check out that Violet also gets stuck on the keyboard with the break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time, how could production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new minimum without any major public protest without saying, "They warned you!" Instead, it seems that COYOTE UGLY intends to try to kiss each of the main bars of the world. Advertising girls in a bar, but showing a thin story of "chase the dream", disappointed all the male teenagers you targeted! <br /> <br /> And, finally, the music. I found absolutely no breakdown of the music I found in this movie, especially when it was necessary (the hospital scene). Each scene felt like a short music video that you just want to stop until the bar opens. But the climax was a definitive laugh: a song similar to that of the 80s, which is expected to Cyndi Lauper jump on stage and play with Violet. Wow, I personally thought that Bon Jovi was also going to jump with long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Besides the really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple of cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be ashamed of. If you saw it or did it, it just seemed to kill time. Or lose depending on how you look at it.
