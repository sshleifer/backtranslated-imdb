This was a disappointing movie for me. I came across a boxed game called "Classic Film Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually enjoy films made in that style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I do not think it's a black movie at all. There seems to be a tendency these days to label and market each B and B film made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a male protagonist pursued, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the action of the film takes place indoors. Those are the only black elements that I could see. There is no widespread paranoia, nor any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and not as convincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested to hear what other black film connoisseurs have to say about it.
