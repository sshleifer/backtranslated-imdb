If you can do it through the titles / intro of "Classic Meyer", you can navigate through anything. But, would you like it? I did not find much there to dig my teeth. I suppose if you get into it with low expectations of enthusiasm, you'll be delighted (at Charlie's Angels). But for my money, I would like something more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel like I'm asking for porridge at the teacher's feet. the man got the goods. but he simply will not share.
