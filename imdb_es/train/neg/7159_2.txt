I thought I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but this movie competes with her. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who falls asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance began. I woke up, and started looking at him again. Why did I deserve that? The whole movie was a torture, I have to use the fast forward to see it complete. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could do this. I have to think that he did the director a favor, or really needed money, because movie after movie he's doing, he's ruining himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? It is not scary, stupid plot, the characters are horrible (but I really liked that of Jared Harris), the effects are very poor, the lack of deaths and blood, etc .; In three words, it has anything. And I'm serious. I can not stand how a director can make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was most disappointed was when I saw on the cover of the video that the movie was presented by "Stephen King". Do you think I could never present this shit, right? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my review of "The Return of the Texas Massacre," there will always be worse movies, so it does not deserve 1 in 10)
