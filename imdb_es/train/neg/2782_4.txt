I just watched the movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring all who can with them from the old country, and invade and take care of what the Americans have been working on. Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration and a much worse way of telling people about this. That's the main. Another thing, the writing, direction and filming in general is at the level of the fans of the village. The actors did quite well, but it was not their decision to save this pile of garbage. Some jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. I could not wait to get out of the theater, get my money back.
