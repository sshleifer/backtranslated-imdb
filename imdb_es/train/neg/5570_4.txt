value it. <br /> <br /> entertainment: a trashy script that has been written by unintelligent people in front of typewriters a thousand times ... pathetic performance that is frustrated by history ... OK production value, included good set / location and gorgeous girl .. -information 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie has no social message. is free of ideas ... but if I pretend that I was 10 years old and my IQ was 70. I feel the message is: do not be afraid to love? - rating 0/10 <br /> <br /> objectionable things: nothing special, just the hedonic and arrogant Jewish attitude that the writer / director presents. in general terms, well, nothing degenerate -8/10 <br /> <br /> the general rating is 4/10
