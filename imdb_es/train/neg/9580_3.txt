Rob Lowe, former actor of the brat and a beautiful child, stars in a movie set in a high security American prison. I felt that his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY is not that kind of movie, it's more like a "Man on the run" movie like THE FUGITIVE. He also winks at the issues of punishment and justice with James Coburn, who introduces himself as a spokesman for the justice lobby for victims, but any intelligent discussion about how society should treat criminals is completely ignored. as the film degenerates into old clich√©s. of shooting and car chases
