Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw some pretty bad pictures, over the years. The sound stinks, so does the quality of the image, the direction, the performance, etc., etc. The only good shots (that is, funny, because they are so bad) are the special effects. In general there are about 5 minutes of laughter. The rest of the movie gives you brain damage.
