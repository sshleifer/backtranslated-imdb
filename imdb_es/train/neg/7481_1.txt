Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that his teenage career ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films released in years, an unmistakable disaster in which the two protagonists indulge in a frantic exhibition of their brand tics in an effort to compensate for a bad script and bad leader. This thing should have been stifled at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope that John Cleese has been paid a lot for having his name associated with this disaster. He is the only artist who overcame this stinking stench, more or less unharmed, and his only fault was that he did not realize that the rest of the cast would sink the image.
