This movie must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got this by accident. I thought it was a joke before the real movie. This was terrible, I was waiting for it to get scary and never did. This movie had no real facts about the true zodiac killer. The filmmakers clearly did not even bother to investigate anything about the murders ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about anything that is true to their name. I'm upset because I did not realize it was not the movie before. I try to like something from each movie, I do not hate movies ... never ... except this one. If you had not given him stars, he definitely would have done it. 1 out of 10
