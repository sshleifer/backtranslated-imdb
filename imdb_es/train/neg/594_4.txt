I just rented Creep and it did not impress me at all. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt bad because the blood alone was shocking. <br /> <br /> I left my living room several times with the desperation that something would happen with this movie. Have not we seen all this before? I did not like any of the characters in the guy in the sewer. I felt bad for him. But, once again, I could not think why he was still alive and not killed by the Creep. So many questions must be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see the similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not a good one. judge for yourself
