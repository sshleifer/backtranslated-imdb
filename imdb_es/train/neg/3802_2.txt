I know that actors and actresses like to try different types of movies (well, nobody wants to be pigeonholed), but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better than this. "Angels in the Outfield" is another film in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes out and saves the day. Do I need to tell you how it ends? The film is simply a bit of escapism (examples of great escapism are the various science fiction films of the 50s). If these films had some political background, or at least offered us a new vision of life, then they would be fine; This is simply useless Much closer to the diabolical than the angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect they do not want to emphasize this in their resumes.
