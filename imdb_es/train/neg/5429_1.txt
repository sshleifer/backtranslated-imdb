The movie starts with a nice song It seems a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking suspiciously but suddenly we are forced into a comedy With stupid routine idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like older children Their scenes are Pretty fun first and then they get boring. There is a boring sub-plot that Tanushree's brother was killed. Towards the end, the film tries to get serious with the villain who kidnaps our heroes, but here he becomes stupid. from HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase at Payal's house <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it makes you fall asleep <br /> <br /> Priyan's address is very bad music (Pritam) is a routine, except the first song <br /> <br /> The cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap aspect in everything <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene, where he is going to pay his rent and I was glad that the actor is not noisy and exaggerated like other movies, but No, he becomes his habitual person and it becomes irritating most of the times that Tusshar should not speak in a movie, his dialing over the phone it is terrible. Sharman is the savior. He is the only actor who acts very well in this movie. Kunal Khemmu tries his best. comic movie as an adult, but not very impressive Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan has less possibilities and it is usual that Payal is not an actress Murli Sharma is terrible
