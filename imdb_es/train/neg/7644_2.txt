It's been a long time since I last saw such a bad movie ... The acting is very normal, the story is horribly boring and I have no words for the execution. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood, a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one on the TV show, where the hell are you?) did it right, the cast was 80% of the forgotten actors. If you were expecting a relaunch of your career, then I think it could never happen with this in your CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and clearly should remain an actor) did it. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the others. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you ever consider seeing this, I recommend you use something less traumatic, because it's not only a total waste of time, but also a weak example of how bad cinema looks.
