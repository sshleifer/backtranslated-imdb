This is one of those movies that appears on the wire at two o'clock in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while ironing. The performance is second category. Poor Mathew Modine seems to walk asleep throughout the film. And may God help Gina Gershon. His accent is too exaggerated. It does not sound like a real English woman. It sounds forced and false, much like his performance. He should stick to what he does best, a lesbian scam artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. Empty, insipid and silly. How are we supposed to care about these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman got lost in Central Park. Really? It is not that difficult to navigate through Central Park. You just have to follow any way out. Not only did I not care about any of the characters, I hated them. The only reason I even got stuck with this train wreck of a movie was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy and there is nothing that surprises us. The script was horrible as was the performance. If you catch this fish, give it back!
