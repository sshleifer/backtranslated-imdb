['For me it makes sense that this film is receiving praise from Hollywood because many times in Hollywood everything is just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who like the movie may be reacting to the countless songs that are spit on you instead of the content of the story. However, this movie is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy seems ridiculous. In no way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the performance of the Oscars, so many that they have been excited BEFORE the film came to light. I can not even believe that Condon is set to be nominated for an Academy Award when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a story of anything. A lot of songs do not make a movie.']
