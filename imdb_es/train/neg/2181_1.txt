I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This movie was boring and obviously aimed at men who like to look at corpulent women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it completely lost my interest. It seemed to be in the same genre as Ed Wood's films: the bottom of the barrel.
