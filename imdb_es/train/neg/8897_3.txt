I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before seeing this, I had listened to the original Broadway recording, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the hell? This movie is missing many songs from the musical to scream out loud! Who decided to do all that ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he ever did! The film was more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Scottish Highlands. And who the hell decided to cut all the Meg songs from the movie? <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered: "Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they would probably be angry about the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie. <br /> <br /> Song and acting wisely, Mr. Kelly, you passed the test. audition with great success, but you're in a movie that lacks a lot of text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
