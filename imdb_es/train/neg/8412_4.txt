I just watched DreamGirls yesterday, and I was very unimpressed. Despite all the buzz of the Oscars, this is nothing special. Anyone who is really impressed with this movie has never bothered to see any of the true musical classics of the film. Except for the great musical and dramatic performance of Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is just a glorified television movie without style or style. Only a group of amateurs singing to each other! <br /> <br /> Now, the first half hour was good, but I was irritated by the way Eddie Murphy's fabulous raveup was cut short and interrupted by the montages. Those were easily the best songs and the best performances in the movie. And the part of the "rise to the top" movie was the only part of the movie that had a coherent point of view or any impulse. The remaining hour and 45 minutes were a formless, incomprehensible mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually boring and included too many sound-like melodies. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to convert any of the melodies into great show pieces as he expected them to do. Each number in the second half was only one close-up after another of people who "sang" to each other. And the way they shot the large number of "love me" of Hudson was criminal! Condon just shot him on stage, without any drama! God, it stunk! <br /> <br /> And notice to everyone involved - that the "dialogue to sing and talk" things might work on stage, but they DO NOT WORK ON MOVIES (see the shameful flaws of Evita and Phantom). All that "I'll give you something Efff-ieeee!" The shit should have been left on the floor of the editing room. Those are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Once again, the film, with the exception of Eddie Murphy's incredible performance, was nothing more than a glorified television movie. There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to give Oscar the "one to beat" the pre-release. In general, this movie was, with the exception of Eddie, NOW CLOSER TO a movie of Oscar's caliber! (except for Eddie) I would classify it just above with Grease 2. GREAT disappointment, especially after all the hype (very expensive!).
