.... And after seeing this pile of garbage, you will not be surprised if it has not been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie from any point of view, but when I point out that it is one of the worst movies that has the name of Stephen King in the credits, you can begin to imagine how bad it is. The film begins with two characters with their mouths open to a scene of horror: <br /> <br /> "My God, what happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I do not know, but sure Hates cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera moves to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung dead and mutilated. Boy, this guy is right, someone hates cats and with a deduction like that he should be a cop. Oh, wait a minute, he's a cop and when a movie starts with a cop making such an obvious observation, you just know you're going to be watching a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confusing. Finally we discover that the monsters of the title need the blood of the virgins to survive. Would not you be looking for a virgin in the biblical belt of the Midwest instead of a coastal American city? Having said that, at least we know the motives of the monsters: that's the only thing we learn. We never learn how they can change shape or how they can make the cars go invisible and this jar with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR. The monstrous mother is killing several policemen with her own hands or exploiting them with a police firearm (!), But if her monster race is immune to the firepower of the police, why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or be invisible? The disappearance of the creatures is equally ill-thought, since they were killed by a massive attack of domestic cats. If cats can kill them, why did not the monsters kill all the cats that were in the garden? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around, but the monsters never thought about killing them. I suppose that is so that the production team can reach an end. It was when they started the movie that my complaint was found. <br /> <br /> We were invited to several scenes in which famous directors of horror films like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King created cameos. I think the reason for this is that every time an unknown and difficult actor read the script, they instantly decided that it did not matter what, they were not going to appear in such a bad movie, so Stephen King had to call his friends from terror to fill them. out of the cast. That's how bad it is SLEEPWALKERS <br /> <br /> * Incredible since it seems that it was not the worst line in the movie. The worst thing is that "that cat saved my life"
