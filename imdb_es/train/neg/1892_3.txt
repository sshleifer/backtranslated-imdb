I read the comment of Chris_m_grant from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A fantastic 1924 documentary. This geography of the early 20th century in today's Iraq was powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in the Bakhtiari nomads of Iran, the mountains and landscapes of Zagros and have seen the film Grass, A Nation battle for life. These traditions that you saw in the film have lasted for centuries and will continue as long as life lasts. I am from this region of Iran myself. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region in Zardkuh is in Iran, not Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking an Iranian for an Iranian is almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
