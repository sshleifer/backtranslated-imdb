Where do you start with a movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> Do you mention the cast of unpleasant heroes? Exaggerated acting? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> No. You just said that anyone who pays money to watch a movie as poor as this one needs their head to see it. I know what I do. I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no anticipated word from magazines like Empire (usually a bad sign if there is no previous copy available for quality magazines). However, theaters should really start thinking about granting refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after I opened with two other classmates. The only other person in the movies was a guy on his own. <br /> <br /> And that was on a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign had failed miserably or the news had spread through most of the country of how stinky it is. <br /> <br /> Not since the days of The Avengers (1998) have I felt so little changed since I saw a movie. If a partner comes with this in a video in a few months, make sure he pays his electricity bill while he sees it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not breaking or leaving the stage; Keith Allen retains a certain dignity in the midst of cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does not do any favors for his career after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is as nice as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> Of course, taking into account I used to be in The Word, the expectations of any spectator on their acting ability had to be quite low to begin with. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad considering the obviously limited budget, but that script is atrocious. . If you want to hear a lot of unpleasant characters, say "Fak!" for a couple of hours, then this should be correct on your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles are required. <br /> <br />
