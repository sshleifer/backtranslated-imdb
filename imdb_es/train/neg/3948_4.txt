This is not the crazy video, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It's 75% a repeat of The Boogeyman, and it would have been banned for the same reason, whatever it was. <br /> <br /> At first I was confused because I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) could have been a different person. Lacey, but she was someone problematic because of the psychic visions of a boogey man similar to that of the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a psychology student who looks a lot like the boy In cheap romance novels and butter commercials, Go to the house and, indeed, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder occurs as she described it. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then, the film changes to a replay of The Boogeyman's story with some additional images that we did not see in the original. In particular, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% are there. Why rerun this movie? Did you find the images in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know and, even though the psychologist tells Annie that she is cured, we all know that the ghost will never die.
