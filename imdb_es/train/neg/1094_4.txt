It's hard to describe, if you were a fan of Russ Meyer's films in the past, you will surely be pleased to see that Haji still looks very sexy, although Forry Ackerman has not been doing so well (what is he still doing? these movies anyway? If I approach him with a camera, will it be in my movie? It was a pretty funny premise, a superhero whose gigantic mammals are his secret weapon, but sometimes it did not work in all its extension, and the jokes They were on the same level as Joe E. Brown's average comedy (or Abbott and Costello if that's what you like) - basically just bad word games, yet I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons Good job, but it's still a fundamentally weak production.
