For those who like depressing movies with bad characters and a sordid story, this is for you! From the gloomy atmosphere of New York City, which is presented as an extremely dark and almost hopeless place, to two different main characters who lack a sense of morality, this film is a real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The reason he won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at the time that Hollywood, completely new and free to show what it wanted with all the abandoned moral codes, wanted to celebrate that fact . The filmmakers then were like an immature six year old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. Then, Hollywood gave the theater viewers (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness and other sights and sounds so wonderful that only their crooked brain would consider them attractive ... and then He awarded his work. <br /> <br /> I also expected, I am sure, to impact conventional audiences. Well, he succeeded on that level. The audiences were amazed by what they say and heard, and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to show trash and earn money at the same time, could not help giving honors to this piece of golden garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, when I saw him again in the 1990s he left a bad taste in my mouth that I never saw again to see him. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, but so what? The acting is good in many movies. No one said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good in his youth days playing crazy people. It was something like the Johnny Depp of his time, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then he will become the "Rain Man" later on. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid that it exceeds good performance. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and it is not worthy of its numerous awards; he just pushed the envelope in a big way in 1969 and that is why he remembers so fondly in the hearts of film people and critics. There are two hours of blasphemies and religious, sordid gunfire, glorifying the weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets into action, it's not a surprise), and in general they are despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song "Everyone talks" that helped to make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was fake because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson I did ... and few people have heard of Neil (which is his loss.) And, as mentioned, the name "Ratso Rizzo" stays with you! <br /> <br /> The movie is a milestone , but in a negative sense, I'm afraid: this marked him as "official" that Hollywood had down the toilet, and since then he has remained in the sewer.
