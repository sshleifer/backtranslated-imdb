Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll see this movie on TMC, there's nothing good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it is half done. I thought seriously that it was one of those soft core movies with fucking plot and fucking acting, filming shit and fucking effects. But no, I do not even have the pleasure of that. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I expected maybe some laughter, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw in a single line or not. But now I have to sit here and see the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I can sit here writing until I have 10 lines
