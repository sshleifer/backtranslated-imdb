I have seen many, many films from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was 'Unknown pleasures'. Yesterday night I saw "Platform" and I thought that the other two films of Jia Zhang Ke should be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. I will not see 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow night because I just put the three films in the bin! Whoever gave this movie, 'Platform' ten out of ten, needs to see more movies. The photography was very poor: it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters due to the lack of work in the foreground. The plot was so disjointed that I overtook it towards the end out of frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious swindlers!
