Let this film serve as the death sentence for the "big spin" of the 1990s films. Known in some circles as Kyser Soze Syndrome, this cinematic scandal was now killed by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation on ONE BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the Soze motif in a much more obsequious way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very questionable head of hair) plays Jack Green (known to everyone as "Mr. Green"). It may or may not also be Mr. Gold's intellectual brain. Or, perhaps, Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit that can possess members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most exaggerated examples of film excesses that I have had the distaste to endure in a long time. Witness the fractured temporal structure, the painful jump cuts, the incessant internal monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This style of direction of "everything and the kitchen sink" makes the work of Quentin Tarantino look calmer. The smoke and the cinematic mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was so bored telling this hackneyed story while watching her. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of revelation moments that are supposedly shocking, but they only come as News for Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green, since I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he struggles as a recovery reader in a University Literature class in English. His lack of ingenuity can only be compared to the lack of moderation shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Liotta spits, cries and smokes through the film in a shameful scenario of exaggerated speedos and leopard. <br /> <br /> There are no redeeming qualities to REVOLVE. It's another Ritchie film misstep and he could even get over his remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie so far.
