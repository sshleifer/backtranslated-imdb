What is that in the heavens? It is a plane? Is it Superman? Errr, right? Is a turtle!?! Look, that's what happens with the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans knock down a Russian fighter plane somewhere in Arctic territory and the subsequent explosion thaws and literally awakens the gigantic prehistoric turtle called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly creature as it quickly destroys everything and everyone in their path. The governments that argue finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a completely new and super sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store. The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens, it results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera lies on his back, looking defeated when suddenly shots from the armpits and rises in the air. How can you not love that? Then there is also a sublime plot about an annoying child who is able to communicate telepathically with the monster, but that is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people! There is very little more to write about this Japanese science fiction effort (and reissued in the US), Apart from that, it is an obvious and totally shameless scam of classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and the designs of the monsters are extremely bad and, unlike the mentioned films, never manages to create an apocalyptic environment. Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unaware of the scene they are in and even the scenes of original Japanese chaos are not very convincing. However, the very personal and personalized theme song of Gammera is quite good, so you get an extra point for that.
