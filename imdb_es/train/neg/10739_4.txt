'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a live to a video film. It is the story of a man who believes that his daughter could be a star. All she needs is to take her to the stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which you have to kidnap and blackmail. The problem with the film is not the basic plot, but how it is done. Everything is supposed to be fun, but it is not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow and the final sequence has no climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene in which you want to laugh, but only for the pathetic thing that is all the configuration.
