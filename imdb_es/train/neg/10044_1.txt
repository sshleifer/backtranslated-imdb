This is the biggest failure of 2008. I do not know what director has his mind to create such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story has been stretched to fill the vacuum of 3 hours and the most unpleasant are the action acrobatics performed by the actors. It's as if everyone has superpowers that can run between bullets. There is nothing that happens to them. and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was of the man of Anil Kapoor, at the best moment when he plays the role of villain with a comic act that Hinglish speaks ... Akki is also doing a good job ... But the film simply forgets it.
