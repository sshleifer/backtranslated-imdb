There were moments during the movie that I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason I endured the whole movie was because I could not believe how bad it really was and I thought I had to improve. This really was a horror movie. I was horrified that I wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life and I will never go back. The other two hours I spent mourning for the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone who wants to torture and tell them that the suspense will kill them.
