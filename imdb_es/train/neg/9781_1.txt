I do not think he's too far from the base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I've seen. I have been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day", "To Hell and Back", "Bridge on the River Kwai" (all in black and white) that have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I have seen better dialogue and acting in high school written by students. Act an act. The plot, however, is not a bad premise, it is only poorly implemented. However, it's like a traffic accident, it seems I could not turn it off! A film does not need large amounts of money or big sets, that is, "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is not an excuse. What were you thinking?
