I saw this recently with my wife and discovered that it is better than Caine believes, although it is not much police. The best British film actor does not seem to be very interested in this role, which is a pity, since he could have raised it with more conviction in his interpretation. Rex Harrison seems even less annoyed, perhaps not surprising, since his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, once again, his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a woman as beautiful as I've ever seen, but given very little to do, the movie could have gained a lot by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically playing a comedic character quite out of tune with the serious tone of the film. Music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many senseless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades). <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an furiously unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weakest films.
