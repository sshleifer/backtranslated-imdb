I chose this film to replace the sad choice of daytime television and accompany my thirst for femme fatales. Well, for the above, it's better than daytime television ... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> You have your points, but after the first 20-30 minutes, the good points are resolved and you come to the conclusion that you are watching a movie made for television that was set up with little time for do something that stays together. In short, a terrible science fiction channel type movie. <br /> <br /> It has its points, like the future is dirty, as it was shown by "Blade Runner" ... of course, this is not "Blade Runner". The Captain looks, feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you want to be with. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, it ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda" that reappears where the crew's muscle is made up of poor copies of the intelligent "Aliens" artillerymen, the mystic is the vampire Willow intensified sexually, and the new Captain could be like Jan-Michael Vincent running in "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits"; he only put on his uniform with epaulettes; He has very little right to it. All of them running with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks a lot like the 'Eureka Maru' since they are fighting against a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are divided into several different tribes or sects. evolutionary qualities ....... just like the Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> It may have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one has the feeling that he took the part as a scream! He probably had fun doing it, but it does not help the movie that much. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "ok". According to the way one could watch the DVD once without turning it off; If they see it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. One could see it once .......... but a few hours later, I wonder what it was that made them see everything. <br /> <br /> For me, that was the femme fatale. ............ when she was fighting.
