I was so anxious to see this one of my favorite television shows. I saw Universal as the brand of a theme and a recently known title that still impress me. Computer animation on a stage like a solid name "The Jetsons" or a dimensional view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic. Soon after, until the end ... I could not believe what I saw! How lucky I was to be able to forget everything I had seen! Tiffany's songs and her main theme in a new arrangement were in my head. Anyway, I want to see this space age family (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all computer graphic design like Toy story or Bug's life. The best style for Hanna-Barbera in my opinion.
