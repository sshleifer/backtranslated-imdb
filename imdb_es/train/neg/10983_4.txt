When the BBC showed this work for the first time more than 30 years ago, it would have been something very different for the time. So, would some people have found it quite frightening and could have been impressed with the special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at the work at this time, it does not seem so scary. Also, even special effects can leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Would a train be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT to a dark tunnel? I do not think so ... but, if you see this play again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel runs directly through the RED LIGHT. (Maybe it was like that in the Dickens era)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path leading to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Surely there would have been a series of suitable steps with handrails for the Signalman to rise or fall in the cut. (I can not help but notice things like that) <br /> <br /> I will not take anything away from the performance, both Denholm Elliott (Signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not entirely sure of what's happening ...... I mean, was the ghost the traveler, or what? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story? (Well, maybe I'm the only one who does not) ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ... <br /> <br /> The game has a wonderful atmosphere in everything, with great character. Suffer not to be so terrifying these days, and a little if not very confusing in some places, and have some rather unusual signaling practices ... Thank you for reading my review.
