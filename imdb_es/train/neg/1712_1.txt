If Todd Sheets came out and admitted that this movie was meant to distort the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie in which every scene, line and even every nuance of acting is designed to be a parody. I could probably shit alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the lyrics and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's dad and the other dad walk, I repeat, they walk down a stairway crowded with zombies. This is a small ladder and, although they rub against the living dead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the former sailor turns around, says "God, you're a horny bastard" and shoots only one. The other one is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around it for about forty seconds, while it is surrounded by zombies at arm's length. Then, almost casually, he runs out of the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes have to be seen to be believed. However, I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so funny. Congratulations to Todd Sheets for including so many people in his film and having the impulse to do it but not for anything else.
