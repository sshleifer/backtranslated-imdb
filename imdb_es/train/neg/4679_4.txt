What a frightening movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from some interesting scenes, the film is mainly occupied by hysterical divers who scream, cry, sweat and generally go crazy when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it with a simplistic look to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene in which Denzel Washington explains to a radio technician how he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you. have a stupid thriller that is not worthy of acting. <br /> <br /> Let us hope that the true nuclear Navy of the United States is not in the hands of a script of this type. <br /> <br />
