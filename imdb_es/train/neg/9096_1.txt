I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the 'same characters' with different people is * such a * bad idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this case, they should have shortened their losses and told them to do it. Instead, they get NEW actors who are horrible at what they did. Seriously, I felt that I was in a high school or (bad) university game with the acting lever that these people reveal. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was this your first movie? Surely it seemed. <br /> <br /> This film is also parallel to the original in a few lines of expression. I had just finished seeing the first and I put # 2. I was very excited to see the second one and it ended up being the worst show I've seen in a long time. Almost never * NEVER * turn off a movie, but it definitely went away after about 30 - 40 minutes.
