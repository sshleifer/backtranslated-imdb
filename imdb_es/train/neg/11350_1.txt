While there has been 3D technology (I think in the 1950s), an animation has been created for it. I remember specifically, a caricature of Donald Duck with Chip and Dale in it. I do not remember the name at this time, but the plot was that Donald was working in a circus, he was feeding an elephant peanut and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts. This was done to see 3d probably in 1960. If you happen to see Meet the Robinsons in 3D in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the film and explained the details of its origin. There are probably around 100 cartoons made specifically to be seen through 3D glasses. This statement was a bad move because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. On top of that, this looks like a bad movie.
