One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it is something plausible. I would think that an antimatter bomb would cause considerably more damage than it was intended for. But I leave that to the physicists who could have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> It's a crisis facing the earth because solar flares are getting out of hand. They are approaching Earth, so much that it has become unbearable, as if the whole Earth were the Valley of Death. The answer is an antimatter bomb that a spacecraft will have to carry to the sun and explode there. That will deflect the flares in the direction of, say, Mercury, as long as it is not in direct alignment with Earth. <br /> <br /> Who to deliver it to, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep his mind on the business in question and not on the fugitive son, Corin Nemec. The personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation that in This crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. The idea that he may not survive does not enter his thinking. He is doing everything possible to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems like a bad combination of 2001, a space odyssey and a trip to the bottom of the sea. Boyle seems to be following Gene Hackman's example as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently the only one in the cast who realizes he is in a turkey and acts accordingly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is unconditional, True blue and opaque. Except possibly the desert rat Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film was directed by the famous Hollywood flop film supplier, Allen Smithee. The film gets up to four stars for the cast involved and arrived in time for a Thanksgiving size.
