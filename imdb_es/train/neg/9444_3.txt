There's only one thing I'm going to say about Cat in the hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy that sucks ... I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only stunk but were not exactly appropriate for children. Oh, and by the way, the way the hat cat spoke was annoying ... as far as the plot that I forgot completely. Who cares that I suck anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers tried to make him sound like him in Austin's powers without the swinger talk and he was very successful, but it was very annoying. I do not see it, it belongs to the last 100 .............................. the jokes are so ingenious that they are funny
