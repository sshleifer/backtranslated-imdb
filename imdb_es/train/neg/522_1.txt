Around 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but because of its lack. They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny things should have been with as much language and talk as vulgar as they could. When this diminished (very rare), we sat and watched (we did not laugh, yes) and we expected the following rude or offensive remarks. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we had read said how good this was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it "smart" and said it was not a gross sexual comedy. Was it the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've come out of ... and I do not regret it. I'm tired of trying to see comedies in America.
