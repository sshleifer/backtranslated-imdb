Carlo Verdone once managed to combine an excellent comedy with intelligent and subtle analysis and social criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and he became another boring director "more sacred than you". <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be summarized more or less in a line "working class = kind and warm, while upper class = snobbish and tortuous, but love wins in the end". <br /> <br /> Such a clich√©d cliche for such an intelligent director. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to talk about in the movie. Each character is a walking stereotype: the self-made man who forgets his roots but who will become "good" again, the despised woman, the rich and rebellious girl who falls in love with the honest but poor man ... Acting is just average. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing in all aspects.
