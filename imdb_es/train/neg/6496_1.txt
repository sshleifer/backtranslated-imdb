This movie was a disappointment. I really wanted to see a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and does not turn it off until the end, but I forced myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not turn it off was because I'm a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him act on it. I was speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Thanks Christian Slater for putting humor. If you had not been in this movie, I would have bored my head. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins should stick to the acting. When the movie ended, I did not even understand the plot. I was confused and annoyed.
