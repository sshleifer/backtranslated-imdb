This is a gore fest of the late 80's, slightly interesting, with some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can overcome the ridiculousness of all this, you could actually get a little enjoyment of this. The acting is horrible and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between bloody slug attacks, but the movie is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are pretty good, and the blood is well made. It reminded me of the remake of Blob, probably because of the thinness of it all. All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I would not suggest watching this movie unless you have a strong stomach and you like this kind of thing.
