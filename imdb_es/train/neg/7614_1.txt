This may be one of the worst movies ever made in production. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the man walks ... and walks ... and walks (spoiler). There are about 15 minutes of walking. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that there are many problems with lighting, and it is almost as if they had filmed the night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The performance was TERRIBLE. It seems that they found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took away the people who were rejected. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of everything sacred, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize. The director must be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for imposing this on the public.
