This movie is a twisted nonsense from a movie, set in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends with a strange and violent guest who simply sits and watches the 4 family members at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this film, with sexual drugs and violence so widespread that I am surprised that it has surpassed the censors. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it will only attract those we should not be encouraging to, rather than any supposed underlying message that the rest of us take into account. A film that is pleased with the worst element of society and anyway is an authentic caress ... A disappointment of a man who made the sublime films Dead or Alive and Audition.
