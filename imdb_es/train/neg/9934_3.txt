As a casual listener to the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, since this movie is very "of its age", in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s) this seems like shit to me of hippie purist propaganda, but I'm sure this movie It was not made for me, but people who were active during the 60s. I expected there to be a lot of drugs with the St Stones, I was disappointed, I actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much that I felt like I was working with them to come to a conclusion of this terrible movie of God. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suspect that they follow a similar style of direction, a kind of "amateur" that gave the feeling that the Eurotrash television program, misdirected, cleverly prepared and lacking in Real entertainment value. My only good opinion of this is that I did not waste money on that, it was free with a Sunday newspaper.
