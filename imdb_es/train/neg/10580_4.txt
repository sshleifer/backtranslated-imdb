I saw it last week after picking up the cheap DVD. I had wanted to see it for years, finding the scheme of the plot very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought that the main actor was very flat. This type of part required a performance like Johny Depp in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a scam), but I think that television budgets do not always extend to this kind of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought the address was confusing and boring, just to remind me that Carpenter has not made a decent movie from In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story, well, I was also disappointed! I guess there was no way I could meet my expectations, but I thought the reward and the explanation were bad, and the way he finally got the movie against the weather was the least possible. <br /> <br /> This was written by One of AICN's main collaborators, and it can be said that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result of a good initial premise. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD to the store where same day!
