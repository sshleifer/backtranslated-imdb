I do not usually comment, but there are things that have to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The performance, by Jeremy London, was horrible! I did not think he could be so bad. The plot could have been good, if it had been well directed, along with a good solid performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that you read about and think you have great potential to entertain, but you will be disappointed from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I got good laughs. I would not waste my time if it were you.
