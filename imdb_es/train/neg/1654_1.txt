Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoilers specific to the scene (but who the hell care) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1's. Even for the most unusual films, I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, humor, even a good rhythm to be as objective as possible about the score. Looking at it within its own genres or subgenres. But here there is absolutely nothing that redeems. I can not remember again when a movie sent me to walk around the room when it was over. The only reason I came to the end was because I could not seem to change the channel; I just stood there horrified, watching to see how insultingly stupid the next one would be. It was like watching a snake digest a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and separate this baby, okay? First of all, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. The images are all comedy style. The scenes cut are only images of the traffic of the street passing through the night again and again. The music and the score, not only do not contribute to the film, but they are unpleasant. Not to mention that he has nothing to contribute anyway. The performance is like the cardboard that comes, all around and that applies to Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" that caused this train to be illuminated with green light) as well. These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose than the director Peter M. Cohen had met them at a bus station minutes before filming. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no 'An original bone in your body. He has no imagination. It does not show us anything that we have not seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or "twist", of this film is based on attacking men and the "idea" that an empowered woman can play men "as they are played". Anyone who thinks that this is somehow a twist or that in some original way, obviously, has never turned on a television before. Crooked and shallow women are common. Hitting men is the norm. It is not stealing anything specifically, it is worse: it is stealing from clich√©s. I can not imagine a woman making a film that would describe other women based on both stereotypes and this feeling of contempt. It makes me want to rent "In the Company of Men", or better yet, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be a "sharper" version of "There is something about Mary" so bad that you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The movie has no information about women, men, dates, sex or really anything. Cohen is simply content to regurgitate the myths with which he has been indoctrinated from other sexist films. At the other extreme, the film does not work as a satire either, because although it is full of exaggerations that one might see as "satirical", it does not have that basis in reality that the satires need. He does not even know what satirizing is. Then there is the dialogue, which is little more than the characters screaming obscenities at each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yes, good f ** k you" (repeats) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, which could excuse everyone Other Discriminations: there are many films without frames, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and an obscene dialogue that has been fun and, therefore, good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a second. He does not have comic abilities or times. All situations are completely false, they are not based on any fragment of truth, especially enough to slip away from laughter. All the characters are widely drawn, so they WILL SEEM to relate to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at "the carp scene", the "classic cult" hair gel scene. One of our clumsy antiheroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena's vibrator (Peet). For some reason, the light shines on her as if she had found the holy grail. Why does Cohen think that men react in this way to vibrators? I do not know. While rubbing on himself, he throws it down the toilet and then tries to pull it out with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena approaches him. Oh, my sides. <br /> <br /> But interestingly, people really like this movie. Of course, people also like "Friends" and reality shows, so I should not be surprised. All this has a common thread though. "Whipped" is a big piece of evidence to me that there is only one huge pocket of people in the United States who will laugh at any joke just because it's about sex. They will like any program or movie (or think they like it) just because it's about dating or relationships. Their lack of quality does not have any problem for these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly record everything related to appointments related to the sale of televisions, movies and products. cheap, empty and effortless. <br /> <br /> The only consulate will be that when I die, because I saw this movie, I have a loan to recover the 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
