The typical thriller has been done many times before. Scheme of simple plot; Liotta's police are obsessed with Russell's wife, and try to hit old Kurt in order to have her. This is beyond predictable, does not even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and you can not think outside the box here. I guess then the only reason to see it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done in an original or interesting way. There is really nothing to say about this movie, it is not particularly bad, but there are no positive points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. Idem Liotta. Stowe has an annoying cher-esque voice. I read the outline of the plot and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it and it spread before my eyes exactly as I had imagined it. I did not feel a drop of emotion along. I have no feeling for this movie, it's as if I've never seen it. Considering this, it's a pretty useless movie, right? Still, I will give you 3/10 for some reason.
