I just registered to comment on how terribly stupid this movie is. In addition to being an Executive Decision or Air Force One scam or any other type of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate watching a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid script and clich√© to work with them. It is bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you find an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself moaning over and over again, you must conclude that the director is not the brightest light bulb in the film business, nor are they the producers to decide to take this story to the screen first. The mostly low-income actors who can be excused to take on this task, because they probably showed up to get the money and the exposure, is not that being part of this movie joke is going to give them any prize or prize. recognition. You may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment to get involved in such a loser. It does not make sense to summarize the plot or even give examples to prove my case, since doing so would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could endure. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you to do a good work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from seeing this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work. Be warned
