A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of the devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy Mendel's brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she is already an expert jeweler. He also begins a romance with her, and then, when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, leaves her and betrays her to the family, which excludes her. There is a secondary argument in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her, and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar, but it is not clear why. Unfortunately, much is not clear, including what is happening with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe that there is a fire inside her and that maybe it is not from God, and what this means, and what the magical beggar tells her. To a certain extent, the story touches the plight of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet, Sonja is not exactly liberated. Nor is the idea of ​​being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman and, nevertheless, it is the referring bastard who quotes Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the part; she is supposed to be a Jew from the Midwest and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times she has taken the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is tough and takes over, but ultimately, the movie is a disaster.
