** HERE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Recapitulation: Mia (Helin) returns home from the capital of Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her parents' 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest daughter, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla divorced and moved from a city. Mia is still single and focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between sisters and conflicts arise as they confront each other and have personal problems that are difficult to manage. As the party continues (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are discovered and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: Being the work of a new writer / director was disappointing Watch this movie to follow exactly the same tracks that the oldest Swedish comedy / dramas have been following for years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This movie is based on three basic areas. 1) A shameful mood based only on characters that make a fool of themselves. 2) Pain and 3) Anxiety. This movement has the focus on the last, almost forgetting the first point as the film progresses. However, there is no loss, since the humor there is not funny. The performances of the cast are good, I suppose, although they get lost behind all the anguish and soon they forget. I had hoped that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to spend time than watching this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
