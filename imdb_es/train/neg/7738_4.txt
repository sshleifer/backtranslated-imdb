The movie was "OK". It's not bad, it's not good, it's just fine. If there was something else in the theater, this would be omitted for a long time. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also sucked, but I'd prefer to see this before FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or that other young punk, this will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
