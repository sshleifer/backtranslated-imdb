This is just a butcher shop of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the plot of the book. And, there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you should ask yourself if the writer had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and even the best Carlito) is released from prison at the beginning of the original. Here, Carlito retires with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail de Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires with and presumably will marry another girl. <br /> <br /> Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzm√°n plays a totally different character in this movie. It was Pachanga in the days of Pacino. Now, he is Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much more important role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where does the character of Sean Comb come from? Also, I think this movie really hides the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing about. And, the mafia does not receive the treatment they did in the book. They are also deleted in this movie. But, magically, the Pleasant Avenue group is here for the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book tells a great story. This movie could have told a great story. This is just a big disappointment. Read the book. It is a better use of your time.
