The absolutely putrid slasher movie does not have a redeeming quality. She has the Camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... fearful as the murderer, her jokes when she wastes people are not even fun) about adolescents who fight the war and act in a slightly naughty way or resist their supplications for his good behavior. We go through the whole gamut of boring and clich√©d murders, like the cut in the throat of a child who looks for his glove with Freddy's claws, a boy who gets a chainsaw, a girl who is drilled, one who is pushed into the garbage (full of leeches). ), one that is roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> You do not have an original idea to offer and it is simply a waste of time. That's unless you want to see the tits of Valerie Hartmen (who plays the slut Ally). Most of the violence occurs off the screen, so even that will not be satisfactory.
