I felt that the film was dry ... very disappointing, without plot ... I waited for something to happen and nothing dried up like a bone ... a waste of money ... One of the worst movies of Robins Williams ... If you do not believe me, wait a few months, it will be released on DVD because it seems to be a pattern for movies that do not work well in theaters, as the rentals before the end of the year ... This is one you do not want to see or Say why I spent my money on that! Also, because it was such a new movie, there were only 8 people watching it ... This was a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that I needed something more emotion or something to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were also very low, you could not hear what they were saying.
