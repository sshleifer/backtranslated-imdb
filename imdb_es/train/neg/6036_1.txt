Starring an unknown cast that seems likely to remain that way, this "movie" is another cheap slasher movie that amazes me how it was released. I have no problem with horrors and slasher movies in particular, in fact, they are my favorites. But when they finish THIS BAD, really takes the monkey and it is not surprising that the genre is so difficult. The story is as clich√©d and unimaginative as possible, with a group of people in a cabin in the woods getting hit and hacked by this zombie / ghost. It is not the story that stinks the most, but the atrocious acting and dialogue, the quality of the home address and a horrible soundtrack. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and some incredibly lazy movies: these idiots are out in broad daylight, but we must believe it's nighttime. What the hell was the director thinking with this movement? What, I only had one day to film all this? Was I scared of the dark? (It's funny to see a policeman walking in broad daylight with a torch acting as if it were black). <br /> <br /> I suppose the positive side for the actors is that they look like people who work in the local supermarket. So at least they could escape this movie without being noticed. I am sure that one of the "teenagers" plays bingo at the local pub, but she is between 40 and 45 years old. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good to laugh, but it's just another waste of time and movie.
