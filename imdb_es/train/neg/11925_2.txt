This is a very strange movie ... I was not really sure what it was, some people from Low London find a dumb child in the forest that everyone thinks is a kind of oracle and somehow makes them all, his way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster. The film ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me quite dissatisfied, almost annoyed by the uselessness of it all. I did not care about any of the characters, none of them had the opportunity to fall in love with the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I being weak? It was too strange. What's wrong with Runner? Why does Emilio shoot the child? ... That did not make any sense, without meaning. Can someone help me understand this mess of a movie?
