Power Rangers, the completely horrifying children's show of the 1990s, continues to annoy young children with its complete ease and horrible configuration. <br /> <br /> This program was not an entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence by showing children fight each other to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were another demonstration of how to promote a violent television show and such. <br /> <br /> I have never been able to discover what was the purpose of this completely ridiculous show. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst shows for children ever made.
