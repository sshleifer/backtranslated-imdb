I am a fan of horror and gore movies and this movie was so bad that I felt embarrassed not only by the "actors", but also by the director and the poor imbecile of a producer who really put his money to this stupid one. <Br /> <br /> From the title, you would expect a great carnage, something like a story and, at least, some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like an episode of Three Stooges a little more violent and sexual. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While I was watching this shit, I turned on another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept seeing Stern. <br /> <br /> Watching this "movie" I realize that I could produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into the making of movies without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be careful ... there is nothing here at all, but a lot of conversation and very little action. This makes "KaZaam" look like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany did not ban it because of sex or violence. Other countries need to pay attention.
