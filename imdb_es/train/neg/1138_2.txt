This was a complete disappointment. The performance is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt I needed to stop it, but unfortunately I overcame it and I could end up a bit embarrassed by the poor movie. It's okay. if you are o.k. with corny moral plots and you do not mind watching a movie that misinterprets Whitman greatly. If you want a cheesy fiction story, go ahead.
