['&quot;Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all forms of life,&quot; reports a possible victim of &quot;The Seedpeople,&quot; a silly and flaccid remake of &quot;Invasion of the Bodysnatchers,&quot; &quot;Day of the Triffids,&quot; and about Thousand of the udder. And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, one might ask? Because, according to the same dolt, &quot;the seeds can persecute us&quot;. Yes, I can remember a horrible incident when MooCow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by the voracious seed of the dandylion ... Yes, of course. Unfortunately, the &quot;monsters&quot; in this little seedy turkey look like little furry muppets, some of whom roll as evil, others who sail on ropes. There is not even the slightest hint of terror or suspense that can be found here. For reasons that are not explained, the seed monsters are eliminated by the 50 volt ultraviolet lights, although they can walk around daylight, which has approximately 1,000,000,000,000 times more ultraviolet energy. As you can see, we did not think much about this cow flop. The MooCow says to go to weeding your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P']
