This reminded me of SOO much of the "dirty weekend" of Michael Winner with his horrible feeling of low budget in English. <br /> <br /> First of all I must say that I am a fan of exploitation and serious cinema. I appreciate, say, 'Demented' for his ineptitude and 'Last House on the Left' for his sheer brutality without shame. And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin offs. <br /> <br /> This was simply useless. Something like a British budget director thought: "Let's redo" I Spit on your Grave "without making it too heartbreaking now that horror is fashionable with Hostel. <br /> <br /> All this just does not work or to have a point, what about the daughter of the rapists, why bother that the man is an expert in security cameras?
