I do not know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big vonnegut fan and I'm very familiar with the story of this original Showtime movie, beyond belief, but even if it was not, the bad acting, the VERY poor casting (Sean Astin is the brilliant, athletic and individual). Harrison? The guy is completely generic!) And writing below the standard made this gut barely visible. Someone pointed out how cute the Maculay Culkin line was. If you read that and thought it was pure comic brilliance (unfortunately, it was probably the most INTENTIONALLY fun part of the movie), maybe you like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fan or you're not completely crazy, do not see it. Please.
