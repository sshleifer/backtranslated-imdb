This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY amazing. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailroom for an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are housed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum), and all the other interns they work with have the same abnormal model look as they do. One thing I found obvious in this movie is the way one of the twins does NOT end with the boy. I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit. Nice try.
