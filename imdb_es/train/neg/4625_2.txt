How could 4 of the 16 previous voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half of previous voters give you a 7 or more? Who is voting here? I can only assume that it is mainly children, very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; It is difficult to think that acting acts; the characters have no character; And the dialogue is terrible. I saw a rainy afternoon in the science fiction channel. In the sad event that it is ever broadcast, I suggest you read a book instead.
