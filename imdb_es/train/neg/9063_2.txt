The fact that most of the budget for this presumably was included in the heavy duty distribution list should not have mattered if it had been done with talent and imagination and a certain sympathy for the satirical intention of the original. Instead, we have incredibly bad dance sequences and songs with picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is achieved by backing out to reveal that the action has taken place on the stage of a music hall, appropriate enough for a production which is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than brecht The acting talent is used shamefully: Migenes and Walters are good, but they do not have to work hard: at least, Migenes has a great voice and some feel the material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but struggles with the character, dressed in a fake false accent. The Peachum of Harris is shamefully polite and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of letters, scripts and music are often uncomfortable: it was a bad move to base the film on the Broadway version of Marc Blitzstein, but at least his words were slang, unlike most of what has been interpolated in gestures of fidelity. And the attempt to overcome the low budget filming in claustrophobic angles in sets covered by fog illuminated in blues and orange gaudy as if some cellar of pateo Vittorio Storaro completely fails, the film seems cheap, of poor quality and without thinking. Shameful.
