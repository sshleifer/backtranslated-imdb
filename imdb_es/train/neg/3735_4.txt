The actress Patty Duke wrote a perspicacious, funny and crude book about her career as an actress, her crazy love life, and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost reject her forever. With this rich material to draw (and Patty playing herself in the final act), one might think that a television director like Gilbert Cates could bring everything together in the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of the autobiography of Duke. . For those who have not read the book, the incomplete narrative (jumping in time) is not absorbing, we are never allowed to orient ourselves in what is happening, and production seems atrophied by a low budget. The actors are grumpy, and the value of having Duke appear finally does not bear fruit: the false reality of the film is so thick at this point that Patty can not bring stability to the stage. It seems as if the producers were sufficiently sincere (and conscious of conscience) to anxiously direct the film towards Duke's maximum diagnosis and mental freedom, but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process.
