Fragmentary film about a couple of people in Austria during a heat wave. This type of film has been made more frequently and, above all, better. The stories really have nothing to do with each other, apart from the pathetic ending: "people are cruel". Ugly meat, nasty people and a movie that goes on for too long without really having a point ... Ultra-realistic? Just ... boring? Indeed. Not even the beautiful Franziska Weiss can save this one! 3/10
