Oh my. I decided to go to the cinemas with some friends, wanting to see one of those soft Christmas movies to feel good, and I leave disgusted. The movie failed. Complete stop Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, played his character and shot horribly, along with Vince Vaughn, who has always been one of my personal favorites. They try to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. Something bad, mixed with good, but everything went very wrong. The first ten minutes or so were not so bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It did not improve, the rate remained the same, there was NO character development, and it is certainly one of the worst Christmas movies invented. Do not look at it, whatever you do.
