A strange mixture of the farce and the sickly black comedy of the 80s, smartassy, ​​Chevy Chase type, "every ten lines that you get funny". Slightly entertaining at some points, but absolutely tasteless. There is a ski sequence that includes retrospective screenings from "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". (**)
