Absolutely horrible movie. A total loss of time. <br /> <br /> the background music is so loud that you can not understand the speech. Well, if you really listen carefully, whatever you talk about is really unintelligible. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is bad, the editing is not present, the background score gives a headache, the action is of poor quality, the dialogues are unintelligible, the performance is abysmal and Good , Kareena used to look like a fighter, now she looks like a hungry fighter. Hell, you can lose weight, but you can not win grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie, I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go see this.
