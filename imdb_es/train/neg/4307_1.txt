Apparently the intention to be a movie thriller ends up being almost ridiculous. It prompted me to exclaim "Oh my God!" more than once in the complicated elements of the plot that were simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Fantastical or absurd places only for the pure novelty or dramatic and improbable situation, almost impossible, the human reactions and circumstances are too much to be Understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to discover how bad an image can be, you will want to see it. Otherwise, take some time to see some dry paint for a more productive time investment. <br /> <br /> (The fact that a movie released in 2003 was already shown on television in July 2003 could give an idea of ​​the quality of the film)
