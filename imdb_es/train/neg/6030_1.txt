Well, now, I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: that moment when all the people who are born again in Christ will be raptured to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to die in plagues and fire. and the anguish of psoriasis while the Antichrist fights against Jesus (in a strangely warlike way). And I know that books were best sellers. . Anyway, among believers. And I mean not to disrespect all of that. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that they kept this movie in a sack and hit it with the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure The books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need repetition. If you have seen this movie, you will most likely read the book. I may be one of the only people on earth who actually saw this just because of the experience of making the wrong move, and I was not disappointed. Especially not for Kirk Cameron, the creepy little "Growing Pains" gremlin, who grew up on that show, found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has been directed to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you are spreading the word of God in the movies, which do not even reach the theatrical premieres. Well, that's not strictly true: I guess this was the only movie that was made on DVD FIRST, with a coupon for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters. I still have the coupon! How many people do you suppose appeared? I do not know about you, but he never came to my city. Of course, I live in New York, where we, the liberals without God, sit around the Bible taking pages from the Bible and using them to roll up the joints. There you go In fact, I will bet the three million people on the island of Manhattan, none will be kidnapped. <br /> <br /> Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD, where you'll learn the spooky details behind the scenes. of these movies. All CAST and CREW must be of the same religious mentality. They do not come out and say this, but they listen carefully to what the filmmakers say. It's like a group of people Pod gathered to make a movie Pod. What creepazoide is that? Honestly, these things only preach to the converts, is not it? Can you imagine someone who does NOT subscribe to the whole apocalypse issue observing this, giving him a pat on the forehead and saying, "HOLY HOOVER DAM, I better save me SOON!" Anyway, I'm hooked. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially Gary Busey's, which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse to take part. He hit his head on a pavement when he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What about all the shots of poor, innocent dogs complaining, with their belts crawling uselessly on the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven? What's up with that? Are we supposed to feel bad for dogs and, if we do, what are we going to do about God? Does not it seem to the people of IRK that there is no place in heaven for man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is one more reason why I am an agnostic. Good night and good luck.
