I do not think they made this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was good. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first movie. This movie feels like a soap opera. The writing is so bad, it's absolutely simple. The jokes do not appear, the performance is flat, it is rolled like a soap, it lacks direction. The first film had a good emotional thorn behind it. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple then, but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that movie. But this time, there is no cohesive story. The characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is quite good. That was his only moment of creative success in this movie. I heard that they filmed a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2', but please, God, do not let them make a third delivery of features ...
