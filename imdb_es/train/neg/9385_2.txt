The page of "Trivia" in IMDb affirms that the filmmakers protested because this movie was cut by the studio to "simplify the plot". If so, that effort was a total failure, since this is one of the most incoherent narratives I've seen in a movie. I would hate to have seen it before the plot was "simplified". <br /> It is sad to see Warren with so little character to follow that neither he can do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in the 70s mode instead of her Hollywood-era glamorous outfit and personality, but it's sad to watch her wander unhurriedly through this party to do her husband a favor. Later, he would actually hook up with the director and marry her, who, he will notice, never directed anything again, but strictly did the first or the second A.D. I work on television from now on. That should tell you enough right there. <br /> <br /> I call it "interesting" because I have an automatic hobby for American films of this period, and this role adds perspective to Oates' fantastic departure in 1971 (Two - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand) . But the "detective of the 1940s as a fish out of water in the 1970s L.A." The theme, which is the only thing that the film really has to say, is sold in a way that is too hard. A similar theme would be handled much more effectively two years later in The Long Good by Altman. And as for Oates playing a tough guy on a condemned errand, three years later, he would give his definitive performance in Alfredo Garcia's Bring Me the Head. If you have not seen them, do not waste your time with this!
