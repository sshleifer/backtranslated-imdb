You must have to agree with the other reviewer. This has to be the WORST movie, let alone the western I've seen. Terrible acting, unimaginative and pathetic dialogue (and much less inappropriate for being supposedly in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery pack featured on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the mike boom to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely horrible. And yes, it contained all the clich√©s in the book, from the slow walk down the dusty and empty road to the "shots to remember when", when a main character dies. Luckily I saw it on free television. Do not waste your time.
