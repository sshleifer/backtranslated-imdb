An American family in dispute, on vacation in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that this ghost town was once a nuclear bomb test site, and a deadly presence is haunting them. I generally love mystery-horror movies like this one. "Cube", "Duel" by Spielberg and "The Birds" are excellent examples of films that do not give answers but that, nevertheless, leave us intrigued and wanting more. Apparently, the writer / director of "Disappearance", Walter Klenhard, was trying to make just that kind of film, and the fact that he achieved it depends on the viewer. Personally I think it came almost halfway, then the movie just went down. <br /> <br /> The actors are all kinds of "ho-hum". They are not especially bad, but we, as a public, never really feel their fear and react to situations in an unrealistic way. Is anyone else SICK of the characters that are just going to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them some kind of justification to do it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> When it comes to movies made for television, it's a fair above average. Director Klenhard should be congratulated for really milking the desert environment for everything he offered and some of the scenarios were amazing. There is a really great scene where two characters find an old nuclear test field where the sand had melted completely in glass as far as the eye could see. I wonder if that was real ?? <br /> <br /> There's nothing to talk about, and the 'creatures' or whatever that is is after these people never show up, not to mention that they're not even given a real clue to what What are (Mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil Indian spirits? Oh, that really comes down to us!) or where they come from. <br /> <br /> Here are also many clich√©s. Why is it that the people of the cities in this kind of movies are always really, really stupid? Why is there always an old man that everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? How about a new scenario, friends? <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent, but ultimately fails in that in many ways it is too familiar to fans of the fodder of direct terror to the video. Hey, I've seen much worse movies, and the disappearance is not bad, is it too much? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
