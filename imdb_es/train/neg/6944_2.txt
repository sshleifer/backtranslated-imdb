The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized, and given an opportunity for revenge when (after Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder therapy) they put him in a room with a man tied to a chair. And I told this that it was the culprit. You are given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution: exercises, bats, nails, hammers, torches, what you might think someone could use to physically hurt another human being. <br /> <br /> We're going through too many scenes of torture before discovering that The Man Archer is torturing, not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when everything is said and done, we do not care ...
