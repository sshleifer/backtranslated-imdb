Well, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time I make a movie, but I hope the movie has at least a little bit of a budget. The main problem with the copy I saw was the terrible overwriting. I know that in some films this must be done and I accept it, but when they are overdone with a voice of totally different actors and they continue to do so through the film, it is true. Magic to overwrite away. In addition, it seems that the games were built without care, because in one scene, the sliding glass lid in a top secret laboratory has a massive crack that goes through it. I felt really disappointed with this movie and I just hope that Stevens' next project is more finished before sending the movie to buy / rent. The story of this movie made me wonder if I was watching a science fiction movie or not, some parts seemed strange to me, but they never fully explained what was happening, it seemed very confusing.
