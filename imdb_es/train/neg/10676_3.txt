Working with a camera: Why does the camera work in this exciting movie? This is annoying and distracting. Editing: the flashes of the still images were too short. Many of the other scenes were too short too. It only flashes. Sound: the background music was too loud and covered the voices. One should not have to rewind and play again to capture what was said. Nobody reviews these things and makes them do it again. Please reduce the volume of background music in the future. Is the adjustment of the relative sound levels the work of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had too many loose ends. The basic plot had potential. I think the movie needed more work. Was it hurried? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started great, but it faded towards the end. I do not really understand this, you know you have the storyboard before production starts, so why do not you take care of all the loose ends in the storyboard? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so critical.
