This movie succeeds in being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However, this is due to the fact that you can not make face of this mess. It almost seems like a series of established challenges to determine whether or not you're willing to abandon the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel belittled, you'll sit through this horrible movie and develop a real sense of compassion for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then they realize that you actually paid them a lot of money. do this and you will lose compassion for them, as you did with the movie. I can not talk enough about this horrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would have done and, in that case, it surely would have been his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To begin with, you force yourself to sit through a window. When opening a dialogue like the one you have never seen / heard, this has to last five minutes. In addition, it is narrated to suggest that the viewer can not read. Then, we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines starts up, it's as if he were operating only to put lines on the label line of the movie poster. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I normally enjoy) and he does everything possible not to drown in this, but finally he does. Then comes the last insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and, somehow, she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion, although she should stay with American-type movies. <br /> <br /> In general, you may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know I liked it a lot, I mean, let's all be honest here, sometimes it's comforting to take delight in the shortcomings of the the rest.
