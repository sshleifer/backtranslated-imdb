Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a movie should probably give it a pass to this. It generates the same sensation as when looking at a curious series of individual images that seem to have some relation to each other, but never join in a totality. <br /> <br /> While this isolated approach to create a kind of film montage may be attractive to some students or critics soaked in the internal language of contemporary cinematography, it is totally irritating and condescending for us commoners who fall of the car. Openly avoiding accessibility can be the intentional hallmark of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me, it seems to me that Andy Warhol got hot. The only redeeming characteristic that I find is in the values ​​of production, and it is not going to cut them all by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch, listen and wait with anxiety. and in vain for an intelligent development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. The calligraphic credits begin to roll of unexpected form just when their interest begins to be shaken. I have the same big yawn and disappointment when reading what I think are very well informed and complete comments about this film that never lead to anything really understandable. Ideas and images without an external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a Philistine who wanders the streets of Hong Kong in search of a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
