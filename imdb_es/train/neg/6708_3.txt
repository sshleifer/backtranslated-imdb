Turn your back or you'll get into a big problem with the back of MY BOYFRIEND! Only a happy ending can flourish your innocence that is full of pessimism and pessimism at the moment you are seeing this. It is safe to say that the whole movie is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to the zombie shows that defy nonsense to the fullest. We get a name like "Johnny" from time to time, and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason to explain why our "dead corpse" comes out of his grave to survive until graduation night, which makes the film totally useless. Without a feeling of sadness, her mother is convinced to tell the doctor that she is dead. Johnny takes a bite of Eddie's arm later. The spectator is asked a difficult question: Why does the movie have to be this corn ball? There is an answer Any resemblance to all living or dead people is purely coincidental. "Live" is a coincidence. "Muerto" has nothing in common with the movie. Show this to your girlfriend and she will skip the senior prom, turning your life into an abandoned ruin. Straw!!!
