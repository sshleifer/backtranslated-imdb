I see a lot of scary movies (or at least they try) and this has to be the worst, if not the second, the worst movie I had to do to try to sit down. I never knew the depths of the massacres until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I expected for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half. The credits were shot and I still had to see what the pain was like firsthand. Maybe there are some viewers who enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but again I know those viewers who understand if they do not commemorate me, especially when we had to turn off the video, and that is NOT done. with our observation (we had to make an exception, obviously). <br /> <br /> If you were ready for a new version, I would give you a chance as long as you had a maximum of 1% of the original built-in. That is all.
