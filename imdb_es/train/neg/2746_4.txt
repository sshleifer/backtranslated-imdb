I was afraid to take my nephews to this movie, since I did not think it would be well done. The children of 6 and 10 years were ready to see it, so I collapsed. I must admit that it was not as bad as I had thought, but it was still far from the book. The film seemed successful with the understanding and sense of humor of 10-year-old children. I discovered that the 6-year-old child understood what was happening and he was presenting solutions to the problems that were taking place. Finally I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems because it is more fun to see what happens if they make "silly" or "stupid" decisions.
