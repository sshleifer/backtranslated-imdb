I have almost always been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the film would be improved automatically if only those extremely annoying songs were eliminated. However, things have changed rapidly after seeing that horrible Black (no songs) and this movie, (many songs). While Black was weak to the extreme, page 3 offers a gripping story with strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost incidental and combined almost perfectly with the film. Certainly there were no women who were sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water fountains as they turned wildly on the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the audacious and cheeky approach the director used. Nothing was hidden and almost all the scenes were completely credible. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film for Hindi speakers with at least a little understanding of Mumbai life. The first one because the subtitles in English were below the average and contained many errors that, sometimes, completely reversed the meaning of the real statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the description once you have experienced it yourself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely qualify this as a work worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the gossip of the drivers were a nice touch and simultaneously served as a source of genuine humor, as well as another perspective of the whole disaster. However, the film falls short in some places, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that detract from the general direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that some of the saddest scenes were not done very well It was a fun touch to watch, instead of waking up any feeling of sadness and the whole scene tended to look a little silly. However, these are minor problems, because the movie, in general, is really a rare gift to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a cynical, pessimistic and refreshing perspective. Actors, not "heroes", that's the key. The opportunity to glimpse credible human beings in an extraordinary environment: everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the magnitude of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
