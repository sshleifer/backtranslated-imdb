As with most of Ben Affleck's films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That's if you want to call this a story. Many points were connected without any thought. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say it because, that would mean that the torture would have lasted longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this is no exception and only the other actors can survive. Even then, the performance for the most part was devised and was not credible. The journey along the path of memory with actors who had not seen in years was not worth the price of admission. Everyone thought it should be said, they are also quickly joining the ranks of "has-been". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or to see this movie. I made the wrong decision. In general, I would give a laugh ... mainly because that's all I got.
