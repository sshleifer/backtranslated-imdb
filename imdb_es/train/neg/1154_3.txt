May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are making an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, insecure, and questioning her life and her future. Being attracted to the boyfriend of his daughter Darren (Daniel Craig), his actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but in spite of all its announced realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a mostly unpleasant collection, even repels the characters, and asks the viewer to get involved with them. Reid shines like May, and it is her skill and commitment as a beautifully underestimated actress that rescues the film from a completely depressing mud, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such unpleasant characters that it is getting more and more Difficult to take care of what happens to May As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are, in fact, so selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly Kureishi meant. As indicated, they are unwilling or unable to elevate Bobby and Paula above the two dimensions in their ghostly selfishness. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing Reid's performance, but little else. A shameful shame ...
