Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, not creativity. I'm sure the writers were in more than just oxygen when they wrote this one. Based on the previews, I thought this would be a fun movie. But if you are not aware of the latest stupid pop culture, then you will miss most of the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log without doing anything and have more fun than this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
