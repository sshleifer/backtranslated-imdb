God, what a horrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and images here) but, for what? All this behind "Natural Assassins" seems to be an "ingenious" aspect of how media can turn into total garbage, but unfortunately the film becomes garbage in itself. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of television shows that use violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said very cleverly about this film that denounced the fascism of the media with fascist film forms. What truth ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you have after going through this load of shit!
