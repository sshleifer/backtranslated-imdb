Elfriede Jelinek, who is not yet a household name, is a winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. His novel generated a film that won the second prize in Cannes and the best prizes for the male and female protagonists. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art been degraded so much that anything goes? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> is Britain's favorite orthographic representation of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the world of cinema, a turkey is a monumental failure, measured by ticket receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing shame of this widely praised movie can not be overstated. It starts very badly, as if it were made to annoy the viewer. The credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the acclaimed author, a stone piano teacher. She lives with her husky and dominant mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies unseen during what happens in the action. <br /> <br /> Review The piano teacher is difficult, beyond recording the unpleasant. What we see in the film (and we could read in the book, as far as I know) is an absurd, exploitative and meaningless story of an emotional pendulum that oscillates here and there without moving. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is used minimally, initially shows herself as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. Not quite, because there is a handbag in the scene of two steps with his mother with a deep voice from the beginning that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotiv (why not use a pretentious word when it would make a simpler one), Elrika's mood would alternately be the. <br /> <br /> A young gallant, Walter, studying to become a 'low tension' engineer, whatever it may be, and playing ice hockey in his few moments of leisure, is also a talented pianist. He meets Elrika in an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the simple way of so much art, he immediately falls in love and begins "cherchez la femme". <br /> <br /> The repressed Erika has a taste for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a handkerchief from the trash can at the private stand where she watches. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and is reluctantly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and in a short time pursues Erika in the Ladies, where they engage in a mild and extravagant oral sex. Erika maintains control over her loving lover. She agrees to send you a letter of instruction for other pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, chilling and jealous for Walter's kindness towards a nervous student who literally has the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert. Erika fills the pocket of the student's coat with broken glass, causing severe lacerations in those delicate hands that touch the piano. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (avoiding genital self-mutilation, etc.) has Walter appearing in the apartment that Erika shares with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied, slapped, etc. The sensible Walter, for the moment, is repelled and goes out into the night. <br /> <br /> At this point, there is still almost an hour left. The spectator can only fear the worst. Erika traces Walter to the ice rink where he practices ice hockey. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally can not resist the hands that pull his pants. His 'baby sauce' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Rejected but hooked, perhaps eager to take revenge for the insult that recently vomited on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. At one point he is locking Mom up in his room and slapped Erika, and the next he kicks her in the face, has sex with her and renews her declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I advise you not to do it. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if he is in a good mood. I could expand on the defiant description of human relationships transmitted by this film if I wanted to. But 'I prefer not to do it', because this is a cheap and nasty movie that appeals to basic instincts and says nothing. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to say that Erika repressed by the parents longs for love, looks for it ineffectively in pornography, rejects it inappropriately when it appears literally, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly mind that she does not like to be hurt, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world has, for reasons not explained, atrophied it Apparently, it makes him a monster that seems to be a superficial lover, but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that is his essential nature, no matter how hard you try to tell yourself and the world differently. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a little twist. Before going to the final scene, where she must act as a substitute for the student with underwear that has lacerated hands, Erika keeps a knife in her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. She stabs herself in an area that does not threaten life and leaves. Roll credits. <br /> <br /> If this won the second prize at Cannes, how bad was the rest of the tickets?
