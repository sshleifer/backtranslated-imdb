How the hell did they do this? Presenting itself as a caper comedy, the "$" misbegotten is essentially two hours of people muttering fragments of sentences. The usually reliable Warren Beatty seems drunk, and the usually gracious Goldie Hawn acts as if she's taking depressants. As for Gert Frobe, her most famous role, Goldfinger, was infinitely more admirable than her character here. Not even the guy with the LSD champagne bottle can save this litany of uselessness. <br /> <br /> Am I comparing this movie with "Plan 9 from outer space"? I would not do such a thing, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotically done but ended up hilarious; This was idiotically done and makes you feel that your brain melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they co-starred in "Shampoo," but then starred in the terrible "Town & Country." Maybe they just should not co-star in movies. In general, I'd rather have my skin ripped off than having to see this again. Horrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should remake it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
