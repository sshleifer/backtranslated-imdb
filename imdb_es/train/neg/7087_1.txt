Normally I would not write a comment online, but this is the worst movie I've seen. Not only was it filmed as a series of soap operas ("The young and the restless" are actually filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has tremendous cuts. It has no action. It is full of useless garbage. <br /> <br /> Here is an example: a boy wants to kill the main character when he was fired because of him. So (after a lot of crap) here they are: the guy puts a knife in his throat and says something like "You're already dead". Then the main character says, "If you kill me, you're dead, I told the police that you're threatening me." So the man (murderer) says: "Oh no ... the cops are following me!?! Oh ... my God." <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe that this movie really exists. So: IF you want to see the WORST movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
