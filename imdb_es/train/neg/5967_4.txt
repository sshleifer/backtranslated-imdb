Just think, it costs a total of $ 250,000 to make "Employees". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, there are no special effects that I can see ... I know, it must have been spent on that expert, handmade, economic and full of tension script. Shoot, that set of bars must have cost a package. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not kill him and produce something for less. I'm just surprised that nothing has exploded. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think it was not a horrible movie. The female tracks seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It seems a shame that this rather mediocre project has been made for $ 5 million without any loss to production, and also could have made 6 more Indian films of merit of $ 5 million dollars.
