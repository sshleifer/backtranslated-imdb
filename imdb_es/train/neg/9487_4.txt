The cast, although it's nothing special, everyone does a good job, the story seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the ending has a good turn; So, what's wrong? <br /> <br /> For starters, the special effects are really bad (if this was done in the 60s) it might look good, but in 2003 there is no excuse for images as poor as these. . It makes me laugh that the cover of the DVD is very proud "of the creator of special effects of Jeepers Creepers". <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction is weak, this film simply does not capture the essence of the story, a doctor feeding the inmates of the hospital with the souls of the Devil (or demon-like creature) must be tense or scary; it just is not. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a pretty bad movie, and although bearable and, at times, slightly entertaining, it's probably better to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> A pretty sad 4/10
