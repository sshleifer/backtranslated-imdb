This is the third parody of scary movies and I hope the last one. This time, the parody is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reason. In my opinion, this movie was very useless and unnecessary and not even fun. Maybe I laughed three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this was just plain silly. If your jokes consist of beaten corpses and people who constantly throw things at each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your intelligent enough person stays at home and saves money and, please, stop doing this kind of movies, they will keep getting worse 3/10.
