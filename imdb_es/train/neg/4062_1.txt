Few films have left me with such a feeling of restlessness, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how it ended there, I just wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful and derivative garbage, the main impression is a bit like this other movie of "not answering the phone" - but worse The evil of Everything, the rape and everything, is shown without any distance (unlike strong things like "The last house on the left") and absolute contempt for the victims (perfect?) And all involved, letting the viewer be treated like a sadistic voyeur. In the end I wanted to shower. No credits for the director.
