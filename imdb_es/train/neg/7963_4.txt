I'm a big fan of the old horror movies, and since I'm middle-aged, for me it's a movie that was made before 1970 and that most of it was made in the period from 1920 to 1960. I'm not a big fan of the Most modern horror movies, with one exception that is Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could remember the stories there, but I really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also that of a really clean guy was a great ending. Although all the stories were great. So, why do I like them so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, the bits of horror were accentuated by the approach of a face horrified by fear, and the funny bits were really fun! This sequel either lacks these elements or is totally absent! I'm writing this only having seen it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com, hahaha. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get the maximum turnover, they're telling you something ... 4 out of 10. Also, here it's hard to find Romero's experience, they should have told him to reduce it to a PG standard (no I do not know what has been classified, but I think it's PG), and that's not good for a movie with nothing else going on. It is shown on the Encore cable channel if you are dying (yuck yuck) to see it.
