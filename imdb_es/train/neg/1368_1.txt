One is the highest rating I could have given to this film, considering that neither negative nor negative numbers are allowed. Pee yew, the useless mess of a movie with many wasted b-list actors who have done a better job, written and directed by a boy with the mentality of a twelve-year-old boy who smiles and laughs at the stupid puns and the poop jokes. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat of All in the Family) who tells the character of Marilu Henner that "sways in both directions" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor that indicated the lack of general memory of the movie ... cheeky humor? Rent of Animal House, American Pie (only the first part), Old School or Office.
