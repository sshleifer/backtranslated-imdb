Start with the good: several times Swayze speaks Zulu with his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. That's a big advantage, since normally movie audiences in the United States and the United Kingdom think that everyone on this planet speaks English (in case you're one of them: no, they do not). <br /> <br /> But the performance is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in Holland (it makes your fingers bend, and not in a good way). I like Swayze but this is horrible. The muscles of his jaws do extra hours and he frowns at the whole movie; someone must have told him he looks like a madman. No Patrick: it seems silly and it's a compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for an acting style that does not match the style of her co-workers. His performance is so relaxed that this film could have been set in the current days. And it is not. Your dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best performance came from the people of the African Continent and Onided Onyulo as Umbopa that I liked the most. Clear, warm and with character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: it is mwah-entertained on a rainy day. Pity. It could have been better. Get the director.
