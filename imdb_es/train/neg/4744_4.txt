Worst DCOM I've seen. Forever. Well, maybe it's not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The performance and the story were good, but the effects SUCKED! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this movie very boring and the movie ended suddenly. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a four for Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and that fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
