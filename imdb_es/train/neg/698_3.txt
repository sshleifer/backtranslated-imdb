An uninteresting addition to the Stalk 'n slash cycle that dominated the horror genre in the 1980s. This was filmed as Pranks but was released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is an obvious theft from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only recognizable face in the cast and this was her first horror film (she also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).
