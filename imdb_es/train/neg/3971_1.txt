Give me back my money! Give me back my life! Give me some credit. This movie was worthy vomit. Useless and slow. What a waste of energy and totally useless. Okay, I understand the premise and the sound of the idea, but, give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, remorse of mothers, husband blamed! Clich√© yes ~! Get a life! I'm sorry, but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I prefer to watch the eggs cooking! There is no real explanation as to why this happened. Prison? Why? Lost? obvious but why? Acting deserves an Oscar like What am I doing here and the cinematography? Am I doing this for a salary? How much did this movie? Well, this foolish fool hired a copy. Enough talk
