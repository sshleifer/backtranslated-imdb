What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a pioneer ... is now scraping the background ... Is this the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here, take a somewhat interesting (albeit exaggerated) premise, and turn it into a chewing gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is a villain like Chaplin, and all other actors seem to have been cast down because of their "appearance," and not because they were appropriate for the role. Too. I will rent "Paper Moon" again.
