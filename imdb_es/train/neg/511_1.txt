I was one of the many extras in this big bomb. I found myself in the right place, working in security for the career scenes in A.I.R. As it was known back then. Thank God my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit around the whole scene. It was more of a big party than a set of movies, but hey, the pay was good. The attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who would know. The funny thing was to see the cars on the track in the really slow speed and then in the movie it accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many of the scenes were changed as they were filmed, I guess it cost me time and time. But everyone was doing so well who cared!
