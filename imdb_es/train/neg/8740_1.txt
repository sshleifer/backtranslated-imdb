My friends and I rented that movie last night and had one of the best laughs in a while. The movie is not supposed to be funny at all, but it's so ridiculous and lacks any realism. First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is called and I really do not care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the maximum security terminals. Not only is it pathetic, but it is overcome when his enormous efforts culminate in his discovery of the Lego room, which houses the super computers. This is simply funny. The tense mood we are supposed to experience is completely spoiled by the child-like room. The ending, like everything else, is very, very cheesy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer appears "just in time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun of, definitely see it.
