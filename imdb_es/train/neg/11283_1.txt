I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the line of the plot was thin and confused, the prestigious line of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. The work of the camera was experimental in some places and, although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it only made observation more difficult. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narration throughout the film almost as if the whole plot was dictated to the audience. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although it must be admitted that he is the secretary of the stereotype office. NO, under any circumstances, go see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up with a little lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
