I saw this with a growing sense of uneasiness. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these particular people in their attempt to escape from Devil's Island? And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves, murderers and prostitutes to find redemption, forgiveness and changes of heart in such a forgotten place of God ... In any case, it's not a movie nice. Whatever Gable had for charm is not found in this portrait of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as endearing as he always was, that is, for me, not at all, and the whole aspect of the film makes it look like it did. 10 years before. Compared to contemporary films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", this seems prehistoric.
