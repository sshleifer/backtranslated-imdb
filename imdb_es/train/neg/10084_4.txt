This movie was fine, but it certainly nullifies the claim that homosexuals "are born that way", especially when a woman can leave an unhappy marriage and simply fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems that Kate's gender preferences were activated and deactivated like a switch, making this movie seem a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> Also, as is common with movies that try to push an agenda, it was unfortunate. that those characters in the movie who had questions or disapproval about the gay lifestyle were labeled "fanatics." And there was no happy medium. Either Kate's friends and family embraced her completely or they totally rejected her. This is not typical of the interactions between homosexual and non-homosexual family and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, but not necessarily approve the decisions they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these types of interactions. For a film that tries to represent tolerance and acceptance, it seemed like a very intolerant film! Then, in the end, apparently, Kate decides after all these years that she wants to be with Mac and everything is incredible. Is that really about being gay? Come on!
