In the first place, this plot is very exaggerated: the girl wants to do it, everyone wants her, the snobbish girl intervenes, all eyes are lost, the girls cross them, all love them again, etc. Heroin, in addition to the problems of single parents, is so predictable that it can practically be recited along with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate the way they continue to disguise classical music. They send the message that all people involved in classical music are tense, snobbish and closed-minded. In fact, I do not remember exactly the date, but I remember that at one point in the movie, Holly says: "Why do you have to be so tense ... so classic?" It's really insulting to see classical music in this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I've reviewed it dozens of times, but the only reason I can come up with to make this movie is to promote Britney Spears. It just does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> And, oh yeah, while the actress who played Holly (I'm not sure if that was really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it was not as amazing as they did to be especially when she was singing. She was on supporting all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
