ALIEN LOVE (as this film is known in Britain) is a very strange movie. I do not mean that it is a film of an esoteric art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it is a TVM with oath, sex, some really good T & A, a bad script and a very retro feeling. You can imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier, although, of course, he would have eliminated the T & A <br /> <br /> Going back to the bad script, one of the problems is that few of the characters have any kind of motivation. , especially Amanda. Why are you picking up Connie at the bar? Just so she can meet an alien. See what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and many other films from the mid-1980s had this kind of plot, most of them more defined and convincing than the one seen here. The story follows a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical path. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I found that ALIEN LOVE can be seen and not only until the T & A shown. As a sci-fi sex comedy, it's much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS EASY
