If you want to see a real "quality" movie, buy The Eden Formula. This wonderful movie must have cost all $ 50 to make it. It presents a slender script, pathetically bad sets, lighting and camera work, and a papier-mâché monster that can laugh completely (it seems that sometimes they used a guy in a rubber suit and / or a glove puppet for the monster - but they were all equally terrible). <br /> <br /> All actors speak their lines as if they had never seen them before and were reading a teleprompter. The special effects are much more than bad. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really original and witty title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scratch the bottom of the barrel so hard that you make your way to the bed below. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
