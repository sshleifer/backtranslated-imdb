When I heard so many compliments about this work, I decided to see it when I tripped on the wire. I do not see how this "motivates" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the issue at hand. I guess if you're interested in stories about women's private parts and how they affect their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is quite boring and boring. In any case, I found it a bit degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who also saw this and she thought it was horrible too. So, it's not just a boy "I do not understand".
