I gave her a 2 only because Natassia Malthe (like the vampire Quintana) looks very sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly very little logic in this movie, but so are most sci-fi vampires. Movies The movie probably tried too much to break with the traditional stories of vampires. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There is too much blood and too many scam scenes that made me feel bad. A good vampire movie should be more sensible that you do not need to see much blood; We all know that when a vampire jumps on a human, he / she will do what a vampire will do. A few moans or shouts are all you need to describe the scene (like the end, when Quintana tries to sexually awaken Rosa, all he needs are a few moans, the rest is his imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
