'Porky's Poor Fish' by Bob Clampett is a cartoon populated by ghastly word games and one or two good moments. Located in Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black and white Porky caricature and one of Merrie's melodies of books come to life that were popular at that time. Typically, in many of the first Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather forced opening musical number and in the climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a disheveled cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he expected. Unfortunately, the audience gets much less than they expected. As was sometimes the case in the series of books that come to life, the focus is on punitive signs that could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium. Laughter is scarce and, while the caricature is almost saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there are very few recommendations to recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' on any of Porky's other cartoons.
