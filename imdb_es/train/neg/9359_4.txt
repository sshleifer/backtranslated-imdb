This movie is probably pro Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why do I write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian town. At the end of the film, he is apparently Muslim due to his clothing, which has kept his amulet and his clothing in general. He has a six-year-old boy, who wears the same headdress and, therefore, is probably a Muslim, although the mother is Christian. Therefore, the main character chooses, apparently, to be Muslim and his son becomes a Muslim. None of the other main male characters, who are Christians, seems to beget a child. There are more Muslims in the world than this movie in the end, so it seems.
