THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over addressed, exaggerated mess, especially that I've seen leaving France. There is nothing worse than a French production that tries to surpass the films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of a horror / action / contact movie with so many aspirants. I almost stopped him halfway because I knew it would be worth nothing more than the French who tried to brag. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a promising way, like a kind of expansive horror movie, but it quickly changes the genres, from horror to action, from the kind of files x to the friends movie, that in the end, CR is everything and nothing either. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought it was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fading and fading at the right expository moments, made me moan. I thought that only movies made in Hollywood used this trite technique. <br /> <br /> The scene of the chase, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so exaggerated and exaggerated that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax at the top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the murderer (s) with Cassel and Reno playing "friends" like Nolte and Murphy at 48 HRS, derailed completely the little credibility the movie had by then. . <br /> <It is hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, which despite having many problems, does not even come close to the horror of this over-baffled and confusing movie.
