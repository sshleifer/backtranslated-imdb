I wanted to see this movie and then I realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was flooded with unnecessary insult. Now I'm not a donkey in any way, but screaming obscenities at each other is not a good movie. Ewan Bremner is possibly one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witness to his performance in the terrible Life of Things) and his accent "Cockney" is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these movies "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" have to suffer before the filmmakers realize that the word f, the word c, etc. do they not replace the right dialogue?
