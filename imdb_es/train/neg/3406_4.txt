The Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck of being planned at the time of the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. The "stars" make fun of the performance, Lea Thomson actually turned aside, when she was asked for something more than her usual innocent, wide-eyed smile, probably to mask her risky attempts. The movie is sometimes hilarious, when it starts asking too much of you. A small child keeps a multimillionaire robot in his closet that breaks when he is given too many orders by hordes of clich√© roommates. This trite and unpleasant machine, "Jinx", is an important player in the ridiculous premise of the film, which seems to be part of the Short Circuit, part of 2001 by the Airplane team. I will not bore you with this, suffice it to say that you can only laugh when you face that. Having said all this, it's nice to see it in a SeaQuest, Saved by the Bell. Romance and technology, beware, are as incredible as the others. Also, if you're an eighties fan, you can not miss the fun performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie of Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Lea Thompson. In addition, Joaquin Phoenix makes an unreliable turn as a kind of aspiring Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not approach this movie if you're not a garbage fan.
