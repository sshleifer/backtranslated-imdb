I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians with a total of about 15 people. We all expected a good piece of Christian cinema. What we got was an extremely painful, extensive and rather boring movie attempt. It has attractive production values, but it also has a poor performance, a weak script with a lousy dialogue and does not have a true sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group considered that this movie reeked of more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. The striking effects and crisp-looking cinematography can not save this bad or bad movie. I give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is so high because I rented the abominable "movie" Werewolf (1996) the night before I saw this movie.
