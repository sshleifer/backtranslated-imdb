I rarely comment on movies, but I have read the other comments and I can not believe there are people who applaud this celluloid garbage. I know that there are certain people who have their own agenda, but we are going to take it by merit; badly acted, badly shot and the story was felt when the director was inventing himself as he progressed. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film that involves young children, since the creators of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want. All I can say is that it's a terrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateur and I'm glad they could not make a movie like this legally today.
