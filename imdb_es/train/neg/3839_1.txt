Some movies are so bad that they are good. This clearly is not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a true child. The performance was terrible, the direction was bad and he traveled too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over with and finish with her. <br /> <br /> Neither Melissa Joan Hart never considered me a talented actress, but all the films she made were quite low. budget anyway. Like most of his other films, he defrauds his characters by harassing them too much, talking too fast as if speeding up his words would make it more dramatic. She really gives the feeling that there is a team in front of her and she is talking to a camera, when she should be involving the viewer in her character. It is quite disappointing the whole movie, and any leg left to stand, was ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing about the movie is when it stayed stuck in the end. But even that was not satisfying enough to suppress my disgust for such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in the movie is softer than dry toast.
