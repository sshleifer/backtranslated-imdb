Many people thought that this is a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spacecraft crushed to earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spacecraft, then killed some people on the ground, but for no reason. Also, it's in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the predator came to earth but nobody did it. He sent a signal before that, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the director of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He did not live on earth, it is not his business what happened here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not tell the critics the story clearly. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think this is a problem. Good movie.
