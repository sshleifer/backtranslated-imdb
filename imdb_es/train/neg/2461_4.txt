There are probably more people who fear the dentist than, say, little monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect theme for a horror movie, actually. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he finds him cheating on his wife with gossip, he clicks and brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, offer a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and I can probably guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> Like I said, a brilliant idea but it did not deliver as well as it should. In particular, the ending is a big disappointment. Last note: look at Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, Eternal Sunshine ...) on this one. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
