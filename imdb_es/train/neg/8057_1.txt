What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. The edition tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer and, at the same time, provide a powerful headache. The plot is confusing and obviously extends from what started as a story (story or film). The plot only makes less than ten minutes of good story, and this stretches painfully until it reaches the minimum length for a movie. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thinner. In the end, the plot is so thin that you might even miss it if you do not pay attention, which is hard to do when you watch this movie. The acting is not even a little impressive. The characters are badly written and boring, without interest. One of the worst things that is wrong with this movie is that, apparently, who was in charge of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be (not that blame it, not I could do it). decipher it either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit the scenes at all. Also, what about all the sexual nuances between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this was in order to attract young men, but it was very cheap. And the first scene had something to do with the rest of the movie? At any conceivable level? Absolutely? The two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the movie, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt that anyone really enjoys a film so poorly made and an attempt as brazen and horrible as that of Hollywood for a rather interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend it to teenagers with little attention span who do not mind a really bad horror thriller as long as there is some sex and gore (although that can only be true for the Killer Cut, which I saw). 1/10
