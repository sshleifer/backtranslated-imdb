This "documentary" is proof that talent is used for medium purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy to seek the truth of what really happened on those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something that even Venezuelans do not know with certainty. /> <br /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things are found both by omission and by knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex for foreign audiences to easily understand, and they take advantage of that. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show pro-Chávez protesters firing at an empty street (what the hell did they do that for?) In a way of saying they did not kill anyone, but they did not bother to show the images we all saw here, of opposition protesters (and a journalist) falling dead or wounded on the other side of that "empty" street. They can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one authorized to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were on all the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, something that would show how ineffective it would be to be security measures to monitor the president. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military guard in charge in the National Assembly (our Congress) was asked why they did not act against the snipers and said "because they were not there to act". the president ", is not that a confession? <br /> <br /> There is much more, the fact that the military of higher rank announced that Chavez had resigned and 2 days later said that he had lied because" that is politics "and today is the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Chávez administration. <br /> <br /> It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies represented in this" documentary ", made with the intention of selling to the world and image of the good old Hugo Chávez who governs for the poor and the bad rich opponents who want it at all costs, when the truth is that between 60 and 70% of people reject their government, and that percentage includes the poor . <br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought this can see a different version that is being made b And a group of Venezuelans who show no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br / > Nazi propaganda has returned!
