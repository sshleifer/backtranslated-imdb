<br /> <br /> The first story has to do with a young man in a closed house who implores the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) tells us three stories to show why. Couple in a car accident they meet with two psychopaths. It takes up to two totally predictable turns. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well done. Predictable but nice. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man who flees after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and he runs into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Although good performance. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It is a beautiful and lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful designs, a nice erotic sensation and a good sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely terrifying. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupidly. <br /> <br /> In general, it's worth seeing the first one, but that's it. Tune into that and then turn it off.
