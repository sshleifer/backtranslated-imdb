This was shown on the biography channel and was as informative as a children's comic book! I gave him 2 out of 10 for his attention to detail, because for the most part he had a feeling of 70 and the three ladies who played with the three original angels looked like them so the makeup was good. <br /> <br /> This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel, but it lacked everything normally seen in one of his biographies. There are no interviews with cast members, crew members, members of the production team, etc., or with their friends, family and biographers of those people. In fact, now I know as much about the program as I did before seeing this movie that was based on the (supposedly) biographical book. As for actually learning something that nobody knew about the program and it was not common knowledge, that never happened.
