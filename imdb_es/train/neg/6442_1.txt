Not only does the author of the film, Steven Greenstreet, obviously idolize Michael Moore, but he also follows in his footsteps using several of Moore's tactics on the film's propaganda. However, Moore has experience in distracting the viewer from this approach, while Greenstreet is obviously less skilled here. <br /> <br /> Having been aware of all the issues related to Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the biggest community complaints, that Moore was being paid $ 40,000 of funds Utah state educational programs to basically promote the John Kerry campaign and announce their own liberal movie, were put in the background by Greenstreet, while minor problems were sensationalist. br /> <br /> The marketing methods for this video have been equally skewed and objectionable ... promoting the film by stating that "Mormon's tried to kill Moore". This is not only ridiculous, it defames an important religion with which Greenstreet obviously has some personal problems. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all the major news agencies noticed that Moore's visit came and went without incident or credible safety issues in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has opted for this movie to boost their movie. The film career to the point that he has even left film school to help accelerate this. However, this seems to have been a serious miscalculation, since Moore's visits to approximately 60 other universities and colleges across the country in 2004 diluted interest in this rather common event. Greenstreet's assumption that the American public would be interested in this film because of the conservative and religious angles promoted does not seem well founded. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the movie, This divided state, is something of a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's reelection and, therefore, seems to be more politically unified than any other state . The division in the title of the film seems more indicative of the abyss that exists in the ideological differences of Greenstreet with its religion and state. In any case, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and the hilarious restraint of Woody Allen in Sleeper (1973) that says "the Quakers hit me".
