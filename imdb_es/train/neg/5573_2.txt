I do not understand why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, in fact, it's one of the best Godzilla movies. This movie is horrible and one of the few Gojira movies that I can not see again (the other one is G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too cheesy to be in the Heisei series, a series that tried to turn the old Godzilla franchise into credible action films, which revolved around ideas that seemed more valid in 1974 than in 1991. It just sounded ridiculous, especially with some of the themes, such as the World War II scene, with the Japanese soldiers. Praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a sad and serious tone, takes the exuberant former capitalist commander and his death, a serious twenty-one in a film that his fans somehow denote as played to laugh, like a ridiculous game with illogical fun guilty, if it is Well, easily one of the most insipid films I've seen, however, I think it's more likely that it was just the talent that the filmmakers lacked and this was the case of a serious-action film that has been spoiled. It was made even worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond comparison, from the jet packets to the android, to the hokey sound effects emitted from all over, it's impossible to take anything seriously, and yet, the movie expects you to do it, there are no elbows in the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost all Godzilla movies, there is a useless romance, and this is no exception, although one can say something about the fact that this is especially useless since then and inexplicable. There is, literally, no reason presented for romance, it just happens and there are lives that make 360 ​​degree commitments for it. Apart from this, the other terrible aspect of this film is the dialogue, both Japanese and English are horrible, awkward and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar's DVD aggravates the problems, making everything look grainy. Blurry, thin and simply ugly, the same was for sound. The first time I saw the Japanese version of Region 2 and the differences are day and night, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the remarkable note, the fight scenes, in fact, are visible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), here there is little to praise, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is the case of this failure. It does not even come close to deserving the reputation and the fans it receives. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
