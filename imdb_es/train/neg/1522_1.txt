You must know that I am the type of person who sees the worst of the films until the end, often out of sheer curiosity. I even looked at Leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation to tear my eyes out and hit them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I took a frantic jump to the stop button and ran back to the rental store just to put as much distance as possible between me and her.
