A non-existent plot, tons of misdirected / super-corny scenes (snipers / snipers of world renown that can not even hit their targets a few feet away, more what about the end? ---> a group of agents of the law that vandalize a carnival shooting gallery? WTH?), technical errors (how many bullets can you put in a Glock magazine? More than 100? These people fire their weapons without having to recharge them). The film is so bad that even the senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Foreigners, Terminator) can not keep this garbage. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted a good 100 minutes of my precious life in this case). Let's hope the director stops making movies or learns more for his next movie.
