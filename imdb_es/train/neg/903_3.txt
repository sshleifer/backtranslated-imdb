"Stella Dallas" from 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck has not exactly aged, as someone thought that a semi-updated version of the story is now a real puzzle. Maybe they thought that the cheerful and lively Bette Midler could do something with that, but this grainy writing defeat. Try that a waitress has a baby out of wedlock, and years later, give the young woman to the rich father of the girl so that she has a chance to have a better life, can not escape the old adornments and feelings. Midler works better with a film director who can control his excesses, but that does not happen here; Stephen Collins is as solid as the man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is the daughter of Midler. This is what used to be called an "image of a woman", a riot, but does not pass the exam because it remains too faithful to its origins in the thirties. * 1/2 of ****
