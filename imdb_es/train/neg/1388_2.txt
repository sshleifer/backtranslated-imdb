I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing some flashes of the Jet Li that surprised us at Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, many of his fighting maneuvers are so clearly false that even that made him enjoy himself. The flying kicks would be much more impressive if you could not see the cables that hold it while it flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Very caricatured and very disappointing.
