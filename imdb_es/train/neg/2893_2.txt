What is this supposed to be? A new version of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? How slow, boring, bored, who gives a damn movie about these people! Just painful to sit down, I turned it off before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; As I said, can you say "king fisherman"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We're not supposed to think that deeply, I suppose. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler the opportunity to become violent with him? If they were such good friends, how did they split up? If Cheadle has so much control, why is he still seeking the advice of shrinking on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on many levels and why this just sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average scores? I do not agree At all. Even the best movies are lucky to get such an average rating, and this shit does not deserve to be in the same universe as them.
