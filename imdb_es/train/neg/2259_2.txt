For my life, I can not understand why they would want to make a film about the "Jerry Springer Show". It is so incredibly garbage. Some forms, unfortunately, is a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one episode. It is part of our pop culture. I saw this in the United States recently. It's pretty bad I'll admit it. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant by acting. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in that. She is basically playing herself. All he needed was his lover, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. Therefore, I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show." It's more pleasant than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
