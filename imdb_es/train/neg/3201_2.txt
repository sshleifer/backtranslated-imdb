Joe Don Baker is fine to be a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was good in Goldeneye and made a very good Bond villain in The Living Daylights and has appeared in several other films. One thing he can not do is to take a movie as a protagonist, which is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, so he kills the assassin's brother and accompanies the assassin to Italy, but some guys make the plane go down in Malta and the assassin escapes. The rest of the movie is to see Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don be stopped several times, Joe Don torture a bartender and be interrupted, and so on. The movie is pretty bad and you will not find yourself exactly pulling the Joe Don character. You will be surprised how many times the hero Joe Don is taken a blow and how incompetent he turns out to be. The climax of the film comes when Joe Don chases the murderer across Malta with the killer dressed in a priest's tunic and then they get into boats and chase them all over Malta. This film also presents one of the worst final lines to finish a movie.
