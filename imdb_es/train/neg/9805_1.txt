I never understood the popularity of the Saban Power Rangers show that was simply an Americanized second-class version of Japan's super popular super popular series of the last three decades! The good thing about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that the rangers are the best, but that they would be wrong. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much better Super Sentai is compared to the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is completely horrible, try Super Sentai instead! In search of a better program, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
