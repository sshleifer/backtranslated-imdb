It's been years since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) stumbled upon the terrifying plot that involved replacing humans with machines. However, since then a war between cyborgs and humans arose and we lost, now we are a super lady of the type. the character of Olivier Gruner's daughter (who also inherits only half of her minimal acting ability), which I think is the film's minimal connection with the first, however, when the super woman is created, she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter of the future pursues her. this confusing science fiction clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, so I can see why people liked it even though I was not a fan of that movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to devise different ideas, develop a beautiful appearance and provide tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap scam from The Terminator with a muscular woman who has so little ability to act that it makes Olivier Gruner look like a great actor and the action sequences lack the explosive range that was the main point of sale of the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but I deserved a better follow-up than this one. The original also had a good cast as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes, Jackie Earle Haley, this does not present anyone and this time is just a boring movie with a pretentious environment. In fact, after seeing this, he was inspired to add half a star to the original. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
