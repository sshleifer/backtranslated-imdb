for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, here's your chance and then go back to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he's moved to another prison, where the wrestling champions lurk about his looks. Twitch plans to leave prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone is shot, and the movie becomes Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is trapped in everything, so he and Twitch go looking for her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the performance is below average, has a lot of (really annoying) rap music, and badly edited battle scenes. On the positive side, he has that Hispanic guy, who stars in every suspense / action / thriller movie ever created, and closes a door on this. <br /> <br /> It is not very hectic, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a big fan of the original, that's fine. <br /> <br /> If not, you have been warned.
