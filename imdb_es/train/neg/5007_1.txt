There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is handled very badly. In the middle of the film, everything changes and, from there, nothing makes much sense. The reason for the murders is not clear. The acting is horrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. It was excellent in the bedroom, but here it is terrible. Buffy's Amber Benson, she has to change her character one day. Even those of you who enjoy free sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie lasted 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one), there are no scenes deleted on the DVD, which means that they never bothered to fill in the missing parts of the films. characters. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this one.
