My roommates and I almost made a short circuit on our television because of the numerous shots of saliva we made while watching this hilarious piece from the 1970s, important pseudo-zen dreck. I read about this campfest for years and explored the local TV listings of the night to look for YEARS in search of this elusive mob. Several years ago, our local ABC affiliate was known for showing great movies for his weekend film at night (ie, "Frogs", "Night of the lepus", etc.). Then, one day it happened: at 1:40 a.m. on a Saturday (more than 5 years ago) there it was! We had more than 15 people and the movie did NOT disappoint! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith is the dumbest and least threatening bad man since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> Look! William Shatner has a variety of things on his head that only lightly resemble human hair (or something organic). <br /> <br /> Listen! The jaw drops in a psychobabble madness of the 70s that makes "Chicken Soup For The Soul" sound like BF Skinner. <br /> <br /> Feel! Content that any decade was better than that of the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the plot surrounds a middle class group of middle level to - holes that they decide to aspire to his boss --- boss (Griffith) by joining him in a cross-desserts career spanning California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, which look more like Christopher Street than anything else. On the way they stop at a canteen, get drunk, smoke together (like Robert, "Robert Brady", Reed, smoke an articulation is an image that will not forget), start a fight, try a rape and act as a group. from the suburbs of middle class jack offs. Even though I have an excellent copy that I recorded on TV I WISH, it would be released on video so that everyone could enjoy their half-madness.
