I read the book "7 years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and it fascinated me. Then I immediately took the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw him in '98, I liked it a little. Well, now I saw it again with full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how EVIL everything was said: <br /> <br /> when they enter Lhasa, people start to stick their tongues out and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that it is the way to say hello in Tibet . , so they greet us again ... in the book that Harrer explains, that sticking out his tongue is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet, and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama, but not for these two Europeans! Not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in the audience. In the book, Harrer mentions that nobody in Tibet used glasses until that moment (sorry, he forgot the reason, but it is also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! And what about that Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha"? Children ... and the tailor-made Tibetan clothes of Harrer and Aufschnaiter, not of suits by European designers! Why are there so many events that really happened removed from history, just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (the female tailor ...) that does not matter? Like the whole story of harrers son, rolf. The book does not mention a single word about him or any member of the family of harrer. but that was fine for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about the person of Harriers. it's about tibet. I am very disappointed by this "adaptation" of the famous book. And I bet Heinrich Harrier was also ... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.
