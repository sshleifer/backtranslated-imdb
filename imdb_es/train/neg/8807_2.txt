I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days" or something like that ... but not quite. It is not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes her eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> That plot gives rise to a series of unpleasant scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> Very VERY BAD MOVIE. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
