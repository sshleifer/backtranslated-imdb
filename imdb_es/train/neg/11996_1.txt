I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie contains six stories. It's a new concept that flew over Hollywood. So it is not a new article. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and becomes a boyfriend so that reporters are interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is not a good actress yet. When she screams, I get angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in its serious parts it is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He is in a crisis of middle age and he is attracted to a much younger woman, with the oblivion of what he really has in life; His wife and children <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor in Juhi are actors / actresses of natural birth. They are great. But this story is to lose weight for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is going to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but she catches a cold and takes her wedding away. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She has an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she does not know that she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. Meet Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to take Staphani to that man, but he falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's films. He is very upset, it's not funny. But in this movie I liked it a lot, as if it had been growing in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is newly married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to have some serious action with her, but every time his family gets between them. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but it's fun! I like your movies. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. Making a story from six uninteresting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there, the stories are played, but they are not significant for the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Release that woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more films, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan can not play comedic roles, but really serious films. That is written in his life as an actor. This movie sucks, and it's a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
