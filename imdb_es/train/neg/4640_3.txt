Hunters chase what they believe is a man through the forest, although the audience sees that he is a werewolf. Hunters never seem to notice this, because after shooting, it looks normal when they decapitate. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplanted the werewolf's eyes to a man who lost his in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, can have sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) even before the bandages are removed. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he discovers that his wife has also been cheating on him. When a smoke machine sends clouds beyond an amateur painting of a moon (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it becomes a werewolf! His torso grows larger, the shirt is divided, and a giant wolf mask grows on his head that has red lights in his eyes. Your pants remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, although sometimes some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows give it a dismal look. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a good amount of blood and blood. and those are pretty well done. There's even a pretty good beheading later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, a pretty bad doll does the work. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is a kind of occult expert, and he also accidentally runs into a little man with crutches called Androse, who is also an expert. They try to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who have done it wrong. A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to beat Beaton, who does not care about the lesbian scenes, so nothing comes of this. <br /> <br /> Pretty cheap, but between nudity, blood and blood, and nothing else. A difficult story to combine (more or less) The most dangerous game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, is something entertaining. Available alone or in the box set Scream Queens Vol. 1.
