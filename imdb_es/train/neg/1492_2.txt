I rented a lot of Blockbuster movies last night, and this was the first one I saw (it was a Saturday night, I wanted a "horror movie correction") ... Wow, this was horrible , almost shamefully so ... Stupid slasher-type story that I really thought had ended movies like Scream; the amateur actors who offered clich√©s and an insipid dialogue that is hard to believe were written and read from a page; and bloody scenes that are not to get excited (especially when presented in a movie with a deficient script). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no movie is 100% useless. Here are the few good things I can say about this disaster: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: love this actress. She is the only cast member who shows any acting talent. The only reason I risked renting this is because his name was on the cover. She absolves her presence in this dreck with professionalism, although at times she seems baffled by her performance in such a stupid story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Involuntary hilarity: this is the kind of film I remember seeing back when there were still movie theaters across the country and they used to include trash as the third movie in a triple bill with a movie of suspense of prestige that was finally making its way inland. Unfortunately, in this direct era of video, most viewers have to put up with these turkeys alone now without the community experience of being part of an audience that teases and throws things to the screen because the movie is so terrible. What leads to ... <br /> <br /> # 3 porn stars that try to act !: Mainly in the hand because the producers do not need to convince them or beg them to deviate from the prolonged sex scenes, but this compensation it usually means that they actually speak some lines that are supposed to promote a story (apart from "ooh yeah baby", or "harder!"). And, proudly, they all deliver themselves with seemingly foolish expertise when they try to act. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not an Irish mother and sometimes tries to make an accent, which keeps the smiles. <br /> <br /> It's nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I got out of this alias well, also known as "Evil Breed"
