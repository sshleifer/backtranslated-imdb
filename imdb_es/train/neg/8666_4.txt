This thriller made on television is all talk, little action. He works hard to set up his complicated plot, however, the writing is so confusing that the exhibition is still cloudy at best. In the end, I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. He has a scenario of almost ten "little Indians", but he leaves it halfway in favor of highlighting Sally Field and his discovery of a murderer. Campo overreacts here with a lack of grace that I've rarely seen of her. The first presentations are good, but the writing deviates quickly from the course and eventually overflows. A lot of hysteria and thunder and constant ray effects (which do not add anything). A curious failure of producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could not you give us something more than a script full of clues and Sally Field hidden in a closet?
