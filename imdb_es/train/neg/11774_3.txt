He made the unfortunate mistake of watching this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well filmed from the beginning, but that is the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was horrible, I wonder if the real gogo girls were hired. But it was the plot that was really ridiculous, in fact, it was ridiculous and not boring is the only reason why I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention some of the scenes that really made the audience laugh: <br /> <br /> Pushing the girl in the field: who would have thought that a child who pushes another child could be behaved badly. A true revelation. <br /> <br /> The bus scene: the girl gets on the bus. But, according to music, the world is running out. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this really shows the skills of the plot writer. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skills. Why not make her do the three 'sins' at the same time? At least then the movie could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> Running down the stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls goes flying down the stairs chased by a meat that eats Dau, do not wait. . she * is * simply walking quickly trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> Running covered in blood: this is definitely my favorite scene and an appropriate ending to the movie. A half marathon in red paint, completed by a vault of stairs and over the bridge, only to be sent flying more unrealistically by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is carried out by the most obsessed girl in the movie, now that fits the character for you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this movie was created 16 years ago. old men and their companions. Unfortunately, having met the director in the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But, if you're in a sarcastic mood, and you'd like to laugh with some colleagues ... then do not do it. even think about it.
