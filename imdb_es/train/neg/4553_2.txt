I read the book Celestine Prophecy and I expected to see the movie. Keep in mind that the movie is based loosely on the book. Many of the most interesting points of the book do not even appear in the film. It's a "B" movie at best. Many events, characters, how the character interacts and meets in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that appear in the book is very smooth, it is choppy and it is sent to the view as if it were a child. The development of the character is very poor. The personalities of the characters differ from those of the book. The address is similar to a horror movie "B". I understand that it would take six hours in the film to present everything in the book, but the base lost many points. The casting was very good.
