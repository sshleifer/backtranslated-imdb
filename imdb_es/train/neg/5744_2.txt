This movie was horrible, just said. It was so bad that I checked into IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I'm an expert in horror movies, per se. I have seen "Redneck Zombies", "The House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my idiot. And I know that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the film is composed of frightened people running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are launching lines that are not of sequence, without emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction is shattered. There were so many shots at a low angle; I thought that Leif Jonker had a 3-foot-tall tripod. He used what I call the "Maneuver of Leif" several million times: that is, move away from an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently, the film crew could not get up early enough to shoot a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and played it in reverse. With this lazy direction, you're really impressed with the final bloody scene. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) bloody movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the foundation "Dead alive." If you are a shooting fan and you are looking for a challenge, give "Darkness" a try. <br /> <br /> Movie quote- <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time to die!
