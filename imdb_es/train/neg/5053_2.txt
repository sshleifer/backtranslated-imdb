I read another criticism that expressed the opinion that Platoon was an endless cycle of marines who killed people, were killed, used drugs and talked trash. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with that because the film actually had more than that, but in a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this did not have a real plot, which is a point where I agree. <br /> <br /> It is a self-indulgent stone at its best. I really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic for those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to "glorify" this aspect and the grand finale is too champagne, great, the search for Oscar "let's create a lasting image" for my taste. <br /> <br /> The problem What I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his ilk is that they do not understand this simple concept: to describe the terrible and deadly waste that war is for war. YOU SHOULD NOT EVALUATE OR REFLECT WHEN it is an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at this time with Iraq. In case you do not understand the point, let me put it bluntly: if I saw how bloody World War II was and how destructive it was in the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, then why should the representations of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that case? <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support the US decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not agree with the theory that "this war is wrong because the people died and suffered." I do not think the motivations are always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> This does not say anything about the fact that the final or the big final "turn" was a bit stupid. However, this is not the first strange outing of the Stones. Wall Street was a magnificent movie, until the last 30 minutes or so, when it made a terrible "wrong turn". JFK is probably one of the few movies that Stone did that really ended very well. <br /> <br /> But it hardly matters in this because there was very little plot until that moment of the film to twist. And that's why I gave her such a low grade. He was virtually storyless and, ultimately, boring, unless he fell in love with manufactured marksmanship.
