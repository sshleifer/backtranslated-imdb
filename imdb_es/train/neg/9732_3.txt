First, the leadership, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee you it will ruin it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, then it's really fun to watch. As with another critic, I loved the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other, between dodging the jets of flame that shoot out of her arm in the car. Another great pitched scene was to see John Landis as a producer of a radio program that is toasted in the room. In fact, I found that the last 15 minutes of the movie were a burst of non-stop laughter, I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper wanted it to be like that.
