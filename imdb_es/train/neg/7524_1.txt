A handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. I do not want to discuss your opinion, but I totally disagree. The first time I saw this movie impressed me a little. But after comparing it with other films, particularly with the late maestro, Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it were not for the title of the movie, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 is not related to the original Game of Death, (except that it shares a character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see how the Death Game 2 similar to Enter was compared the Continue The plots have striking similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two places are similar, in which both are very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both movies (women are sent two guest rooms in both films). Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis' henchman are missing a hand. This is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, the director has used his imagination and given Lewis a pet monkey . The list continues. <br /> <br /> With regard to other aspects of the film, such as the script and acting, I felt it was very poor. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed for them to act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are no less skilfully executed. However, as the plot is insufficient, I could not relate to the characters, therefore, the fight sequences were more exhibitions instead of having a meaning for the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this movie is recommended for any martial arts fan, but for those who enjoy a solid action movie, with a good story and strong characters, I would not really recommend this film . My views on this film may seem very biased and unilateral, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film failed to meet these standards. In any case, they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> In reference to my evaluation, by granting this film 1 of 10 very severe, the film is visible barley and should be grateful to have the fight sequences it had.
