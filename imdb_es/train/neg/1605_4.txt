Recently, I saw the documentary "The revolution will not be televised", also known as "Chávez: inside the coup". At first, I thought it showed a genuine internal view of the events during the coup d'état in Venezuela in April 2002. What bothered me was the fact that the tone of the narration and the music that accompanied it were suggestive, and that At no time were criticisms expressed about Hugo Chavez. This is peculiar because if a documentary gives an unbiased explanation of what happened, there should have been some of that too. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, given that the documentary is several years old, there is currently a lot of additional information available on the Internet, and it was not difficult to find, for example, "Urgent research on Chávez: the coup of the 5 European television corporations that financed the film that It presents flagrant falsehoods about Venezuela. " List the many errors and intentional or unintentional falsifications in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you will find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary, "X-rays of a lie". For me, it seems to be a good counterweight to "Chávez: inside the coup" It's available on video.google. After seeing "Chavez: inside the coup", I strongly recommend that you see "X-rays of a lie" and form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowingly or not) part of Chávez's propaganda.
