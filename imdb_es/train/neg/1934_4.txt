Follow the usual formula to put a new recruit, this time the first African-American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman disaggregates to the Armed Forces, through the program of training of deep-sea divers of the United States Navy, directed by a racist fanatic (Robert De Niro). If the program was not bad enough, it has to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black peasant in the south, is the expected model of righteousness. The girls, one could hardly call them women, are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent artists, Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook, have even more superficial roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A boat is called a ship. Robert De Niro greets inside, discovered. After a brutal assault on the hospital staff, he was transferred out of his attire instead of being arrested. Someone shouts "I'm leaving here" in the early fifties. (Maybe it was a common expression at that time, if so, "my bad"). People address each other by rank: "Lieutenant", "Companion of the sailors", "Commander", as they do in the Army, while in the Navy they are simply "Mister" (if he is an officer) or he calls them by his last name (if they are enlisted). I did not bother to check if there was a rank called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a difficult fight. Apparently, everyone in the Navy hates blacks, except for a man from Wisconsin. He stutters and is despised by others in his class. It is like the scene in "House of animals", in which the applicant of a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is an enlisted man, a second-class sub-officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of her arguments she begs him. She just wants to be a doctor and he must join her, renounce the Navy and lead a quiet life. "And let life happen to you?" He replies. Yes. Yes, I only know a doctor's spouse and let life happen to you. You can greet him from the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These types of movies were common enough in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", that kind of thing. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational characteristics. You learned something about becoming a bomber or an artilleryman. Here, the technical details are skipped, perhaps because the writer knew nothing of them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not follow what was happening for a few years. Of the emergencies without which there would not be a movie like this one. If I solved the mechanical problems well, it was because I guessed correctly. The address does not help either. The film abounds in close-ups, so many that they lose the dramatic impact they might have had. And emergencies are confusing because they are poorly focused. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Do you want to see a better example of this type of movie? Almost everyone will do it, except maybe "G. I. Jane", in which the abused hero is a heroine. Try the scenes of the training camp in "The Young Lions". There the victim is a Jew. Or try "From here to eternity", in which buttons of easy compassion are not pressed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and who is active to provoke conflict, such as "Cool Hand Luke". No easy excuses are offered, because easy excuses are too easy. <br /> <br /> Completely formulated, and not well done.
