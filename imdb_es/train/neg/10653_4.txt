One two three four five six seven eight and round, haha. This is a must, first to see the work. There's a lot of work to be shown, see those close-ups, man, you'll enjoy it. A few years ago, a video clip was surely based on this movie. It is a slasher but without suspense. The ending is also fun, and the clothes on the wood in front of the copper, Jesus, look like a clown. Most of the murders take place off the screen, the blood flows but is never too bloody. There's also a lot of fight scene, and well, nobody got hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, I've never seen a big one like that, it will not ruin it, you should see it. And being a slasher, there's also a lot of T & A. To guess who the killer is, you'll be stuck a few times and that's the best part, but what about the history of copper in the forest, huh! But even because of its cheese, this is still one that many would like to have. I'm glad to have my copy, one of those flaws in the slasher. But man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are over 40, then this is one of the way back to memory.
