Cliff Robertson, as an intriguing husband married to a wealthy wife, offers an excellent performance here, if ever there was one; It's as if director Michael Anderson kept shouting "Mark the line, think zombie, but less animated" through his little megaphone while training Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is hardly better; Jennifer Agutter, of the fame of LOGAN'S RUN, is hardly seen in what should have developed as a fundamental role. If the quality of the performance was three times better; if some of the most open parcel holes were filled; and if an adrenaline injection were applied to the rhythm, then this yawn could be brought to a level acceptable to the multitude of Hallmark \ Lifetime television channels. As it stands, his score is so inexplicably high that one can not help thinking that chronic sleeplessness is using DOMINIQUE to catch some sleep time. Maybe the television telemarketers of the night are missing a great opportunity not to sell it as such.
