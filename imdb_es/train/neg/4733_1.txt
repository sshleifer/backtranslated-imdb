I can not believe I really sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst performance since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: The movie begins with Jojo and that other girl sitting on the beach, drooling on a beach of blond hair and skinny. "hunk" who looks like he has not been to the gym one day in his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and all the girls in the movie love him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. We soon discovered that Jojo's mother got her life's work in Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move out and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A great storm arrives, and it fills your pool with unpleasant water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the chick falls into the pool and is face to face, yes, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the "story" really takes off. Basically, they want the siren to fall in love with the "hunk". <br /> <br /> This is a pre-teen movie with such a bad performance that makes the 80s look like the pinnacle of performances worthy of an Oscar. This movie has all the possible clich√©s ... the best friends, the "gallant" everyone wants, the "bad girl" and her friends, the old scary ... whatever it is, it's there. I took one for many people to see this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please, do not watch this movie. Do not do it so I suffered in vain.
