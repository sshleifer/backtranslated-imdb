I'm glad that the people of IMDb have been able to decipher the genre of this film. He had a suspicion that he was trying to be a comedy, but since he also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama, he was not sure. For a comedy, it is incredibly devoid of the slightest foray into the realms of humor, until the ridiculous end of "twist", which confirms what is really a complete waste of time the entire movie. It is difficult to describe how amateur the HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this movie have any idea what they were supposed to be doing? It is really worth seeing to be able to stare at the screen with disbelief and amazement at how terrible it is.
