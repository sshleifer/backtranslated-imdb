I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and found the whole thing so ridiculous to be beyond grief. (On the one hand, if Stallone is climbing freely by himself, there is no need to carry any equipment, but I guess those hanging carabiners look like "mountaineers", so let's throw them). For those lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks something like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well, the Hollywood moguls have many more ridiculous and smelly things to swallow.
