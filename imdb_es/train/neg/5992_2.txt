The most embarrassing moment of this film is when Brady Corbet says "You have bloomed", near the end of the movie. I practically died. I'm still not sure why the writers put that line there. Was he supposed to create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I've never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do a lot. This movie does not do it. If I did not have the great Thunderbirds brand draw card, it would have been released directly to television or canned in postproduction. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits pile up and play Busted's song "Thunderbirds are go". I can not believe I wasted $ 7 watching this through pay-per-view.
