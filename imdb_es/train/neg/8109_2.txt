*** Contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it incredibly boring and superficially done, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed topics: since we eventually have to die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; Or should we find ways to not face that question, like Sabina? How important is fidelity in a relationship? What part of professional life can be mutilated for the good of our loved ones? How much do we have to get involved in the political life and social problems of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read Kundera's novel, but after being disappointed by the film, I certainly want to understand if the story was ruined by the adaptation of the film (as I think) or if It was boring from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that defined the film as a masterpiece. I just do not see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them are the following. <br /> <br /> 1) They throw you the three main characters and it is very difficult to understand what it is that motivates them when choosing. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are there just to fill in the gaps, but they do not add anything to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I did not do it I like how he pretended to be Tomas. Nothing is good for him. He is so egocentric and selfish. He is not human, in a certain sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked with someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina can afford it. His lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. Besides that, the three main characters are very successful in their respective professions, which seems strange to me. a) How can Tereza effortlessly become such a good photographer? b) How can they do so well in a country that lacks all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The false accents of the English spoken by the actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even my mother tongue. In addition, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US. UU It is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film saying that Prague was beautifully represented: I guess most of the films were filmed in the place, so it is not difficult to give the film a feeling of Europe from the East and, given the intrinsic beauty of Prague, it is not difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the final type of trivial Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, away from the temptations of the "metropolis", away from the social struggles that their fellow citizens live, separated from their lives professionals, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing that they are happy, by the way. And that? Would they have died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I do not think so. I considered it a kind of cheap trick to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the film that is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you're left with nothing. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them, they leave you on your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated the "Stop the music in the restaurant scene" (which some comments praised very much) Why Sabina has such a strong reaction Why Franz agrees with her I really do not see the point, the only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad temper and a very strong personality, that is, what is special and special about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked very much (that's why I gave him two). <br /> <br /> The "photo shoot of naked women", where the envy, jealousy and insecurities of Sabina are beautifully presented and Tereza. <br /> <br /> The other scene is the one that represents the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians.The photos of Tereza, taken to inform the world about what is happening in Prague, are used to identify the people involved in the riots, I found it quite original and the sens Desperation and Tereza's fault is well represented. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small possibility that the film was intentionally "designed" in such a way that the "Tomas types" will like it and the "tereza" will hate it. If this is the case (although I doubt it very much) then my comment should be revised drastically.
