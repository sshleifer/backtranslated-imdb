You can not resist this too much knowing that it was done in four days, and I expected it to be a countryside anyway. (Actually, it's not that campy.) With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it half-heartedly - Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is really paid attention to, what surprised me a little; I assumed that the whole purpose of these ultra low budget horror films was to attend to the most basic sexual fantasies and not care about the story, but they use many words like "technological" and "physicality" in the script to get their point across. (Although it is possible that the story is important just to explain why there are so few cast members). Nobody cares about this stupid story, and the only things that are interesting in the movie are the ridicule of cults and soft-core homoeroticisms (which are not so nervous). I would have enjoyed it more if there had been some random murders for no reason. The film is grainy, with an aspect and level of performance with TV quality. There are some "attractive" scenes that are good: children writhe in bed in their boxers, feeling awake; or being tied up and making orgasmic faces while pouring wine over them, and some of them are kind of funny. And I liked the excavations in L. Ron Hubbard and the predicted irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense homosexual connotations, but it's still not good. 3/10
