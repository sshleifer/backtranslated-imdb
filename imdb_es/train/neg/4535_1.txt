Slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book. This is surely a case in which the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the stage, excellent. The worst part was the slow interaction of the actors, which was combined with endless and significant glances. The editing is abrupt and uneven. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a bit credible with a terrible script. It was surprising that, although set in Peru, there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering the stage, even in the flashback scenes that represent Peru in the seventeenth century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
