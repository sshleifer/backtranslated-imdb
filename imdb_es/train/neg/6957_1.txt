Avoid this, unless you want to see an expensive but poorly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear: a cardinal sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This film tries to combine the western epic, the intrigue of drugs and the costumes of the old regime. What? Well, consider this. Cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights. Or what about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do a 'What's new Tiger Lily' with this bomb? Rewrite the script and then double or subtitle. Heck, it's almost that now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American public, have roles).
