NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this has to be the poorest attempt to make one. Calling it "a movie" is also a stretch. It's not worth seeing these "random-of-obvious-false-and-sticky-violence-and-an-ugly-woman-trying-to-act-sexy-bad-edited-evil-together-clips. /> Viewing this is as interesting as seeing some holiday photos of a random family, and it has the same quality you'd expect when you send your 10-year-old son to the forest with your new vid-cam, and tell him make a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
