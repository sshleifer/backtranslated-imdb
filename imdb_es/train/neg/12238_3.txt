A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two Christmas icons together, but ... <br /> <br /> Rudolph's brilliant nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this film, like the Force in The Movies of Star Wars did not need the explanation of "mediclorianos in the sanguineous torrent". But mainly, the movie left me cold because of Winterbolt's complicated conspiracy to destroy Santa. He has the power to put suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things in such an indirect way? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the family ... Frosty frames comedicamente exaggerated Pinky and the Brain and "Phineas and Ferb" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are made that way on purpose and they laugh out loud) It seems simple and direct compared to Winterbolt, which is expected to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly strange moment (and gracefully) when a character throws his two weapons at the bad guy, like the boomerangs. . I understand that if you do not want guns to be fired in a family movie, but why weapons in the first place?
