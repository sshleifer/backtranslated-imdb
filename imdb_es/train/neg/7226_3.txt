I love comics. Even though I have trouble fully understanding the stories? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and deterioration. So I thought I knew what I was doing. Surprisingly I understood the main plot ?? but some extremely bad decisions were made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean the "CG human actors" looking very bad, up close? ??Why?! It did not work at all! Horus, and the other Egyptian gods, were created successfully in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a pity.
