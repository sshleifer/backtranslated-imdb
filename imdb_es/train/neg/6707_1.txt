Please make me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've had the misfortune to see. I consider the film an insult to my brain, as well as to my back, that both suffered from sitting down and watching this movie. I still have to see what damage has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences. What a pile of garbage! And do not make me talk about acting ... Somebody, please, help me forget! "Strange science" - come back! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" that this movie is the first one here on IMDb ... And I have voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** p, but This is so bad that I can not even believe it. Did anyone really have the idea and thought it was worth becoming a movie? Did someone actually read the script and decided to produce the movie? Did someone read the script and audition? Did anyone see the movie and decided * not * to put it on a shelf to accumulate dust for eternity? * These * are the questions I want answers to. Not the philosophical question about that tree in the forest and well, you know ...
