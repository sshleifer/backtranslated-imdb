It is considered that fashion highlights every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, however moronic this illogical "logic" may be. However, within the story and the theme of the film, there is no gray area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist is the "villain of the story". Under no circumstances can what she did be justified. The sexuality of women is just an exaggeration in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It is the betrayal of the last. The man ended up spending his resources and time on the waste of raising another man. To make matters worse, the weaker arguments raised by the 3 female characters 'liberated' in the climax are pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are not an excuse to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and, what's worse, there are no other children. So in essence his life has been wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
