This movie is just another average action movie, but it could have been much better. When the weapons came out, they really needed help with choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb, who made that brilliant sequence of action in Heat as they moved down the street since the robbery, would have turned the boring action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the movie was fine, it was predictable but visible, better than you would expect from this kind of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, which we had been waiting for, but it was like seeing something of Team A in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run through a house trying to kill each other, the same old man, the same old man.
