This movie is easily the worst in the series. Although New Line may be looking for sales, everyone knows that the only reason it won more money than the previous one was because of its 3D finish. It was not that the 3-D was good either, because it was the 3D of 50 with the red and blue lenses (anaglyph). It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Beyond that, this movie was so badly made! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse direction. This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like an episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the horror audience, because it's corny and not scary, and it's not funny or funny. Funny for comedy. Just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play all this like a camp and have it far away from what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember that most of us were fans of this series just prayed that it would end at this point because of how bad it had been. This is one of the films that helped to take the horror of popularity and to believe that audiences really wanted to laugh with a stupid comedy to see a good and terrifying horror movie.
