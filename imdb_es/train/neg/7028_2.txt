['Somewhere between Food Court and Zip&#39;s, the mall in this movie <br /><br /> It has an explosives store. This is the only place where the title character. <br /><br /> You can buy the pump that you plant in the mall in the dull end. <br /><br /> A fictional city has a new shopping center, built on land that was <br /><br /> condemned. Linda girl (I did not understand her name) gets a job like <br /><br /> Waitress there. She lost her boyfriend in a fire at the place where <br /><br /> the shopping center is stopped. The evil owner of the shopping center hires the arsonist. <br /><br /> Responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security. <br /><br /> The guard ends up dead. Rob Estes, eons before &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, is a <br /><br /> Photographer / reporter trying to find a story. He gets hooked with Cute Girl, <br /><br /> and his &quot;funny&quot; friend, Pauly Shore, and try to find out if Eric <br /><br /> still alive. He is, living in the basement of the mall (?) And traveling. <br /><br /> Through the air ducts and offending different people who alter their <br /><br /> ex girlfriend, including the incendiary. Eventually, he kidnaps her. <br /><br /> and the ending involves the bomb and everyone running from the <br /><br /> Scene before the great kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is next to the <br /><br /> ride like the mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /><br /> Of course, you probably do not need a sketch of the plot since all the <br /><br /> The story is in the title. Someone named Eric is taking revenge against <br /><br /> People like ghost of a shopping center. This also means that there is no <br /><br /> suspense. We know that Eric is behind this, but we still have to see <br /><br /> Estes and Cute Girl follow the movements of a silly investigation. <br /><br /> Look like Fairchild, who we know has been in collusion with the <br /><br /> owner of the mall all the time, pulls out a gun from our heroic duo in the middle of <br /><br /> a party full of people, but nobody says a word while she takes them to her <br /><br /> Office, and his eventual death.

It could be better than your own apartment! <br /><br /> The fans of Pauly Shore, both, take note. He cheats a security guard <br /><br /> Out of his cabin by the moon of the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /><br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, this is where you can see a granulate <br /><br /> Take black and white from the south coast of Pauly, although there is no weezil. <br /><br /> This is just rubbish, and positive proof that I&#39;m about to rent alone <br /><br /> about anything in the video store to stay in the horror section. Is <br /><br /> The movie is not Eric&#39;s revenge, it&#39;s the filmmaker&#39;s revenge for me. <br /><br /> be foolish enough to see it.
