This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete the disaster! Except for a few giggles and one or two blood scenes, this movie is a complete waste of time. Calling it "Campy" does not even cut it. "Campy" implies fun that was not this movie. You spend the first half of the movie thinking "you have to improve, right?". To be fair, it does, in the end, when it finally explains who the teams of "brothers and sisters" are and what they want, but by then, you almost do not care because you've spent the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what . Did Mr. Onorati and Ms. Pacula cross out someone from THIS to be stuck in such a horrible movie? <br /> <br />
