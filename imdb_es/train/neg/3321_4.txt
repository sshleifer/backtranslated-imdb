Usually, after the first minute of a movie I know I will hate him or adore him ... but now I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning was excellent; the "this is based on a real story" and blah blah blah blah was funny. Afterwards, the cartoons and the description of the life of the guys with photos made me think that I had made the right decision. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing the fun fake aspect of Toronto was great. In addition, the situation and the appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> I mean, maybe it was the first 10 minutes of the movie ... that then seemed like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just that I do not understand Canadian English humor (it's possible, English Canadians do not always understand Qu√©bec humor either), but hey ... there was enough for that in a short movie, * nothing * plus. Maybe that could be a meaning for the title? Anyway, almost everything was full, and very few things seemed even fun. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "making of" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind that that made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I rented the movie, interested in the "disappearance of annoying people". But still, I did not know that the whole universe would vanish, and even with a point in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are Canadian English, it seems that you could appreciate the local humor, considering the surprising number of people who gave this film an 8. Otherwise, just think twice before losing your valuable time ...
