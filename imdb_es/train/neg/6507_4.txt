You know that this will be a corny movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It was made in 50's 2. It is black and white. 3. He does not have actor names! 4. Screams make up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, not to be overcome: this film brilliantly incorporated the four previous elements to turn this into a true cinematic error. <br /> It's okay, shhhhh, but I'm going to discuss the special effects here, or the lack of them, <br /> <br /> Did you catch the scenes under water? It seems that it was filmed poorly through an aquarium: notice the layer that flutters in the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated reuse of archival material (shots of the house, bridge scenes, great enhancement of the KRAF-Tiness of this film, not from "PLAN 9", I have seen such a creative use of the footage. <br /> <br /> And, where there was no missing special effects, do not worry, scream YES the place of the special effects in this movie too.Yes, this movie even skilfully used that old trick trick. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - put your brain in a daze (several fermented beverages DOUBT help), sit down, and I wonder: why the hell did they put this in the movie again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
