This movie makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. Boredom is exquisite in beautiful images. For once, Hamilton is relatively easy with soft focus shots. However, what I found difficult to understand about the film was that, although Anja Schüte was about 19 when filmed, the girls are portrayed as much younger than they really are. All this Lolita business, especially when there is an older man involved, leaves me quite uncomfortable. The heroin is actually shaved in the pubic area so that it looks even younger than her. Come on, sex is a good time past, between consenting adults. Another thing that seemed strange to me was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, at least it is not appropriate.
