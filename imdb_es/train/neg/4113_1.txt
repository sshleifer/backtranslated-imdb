I have to finish watching a movie once I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was dying to sit through. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" like the movements, the way bad guys throw hundreds and hundreds of bullets and it seems that they only hit innocent bystanders, the predictable result and all the bad performance was just horrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends' apartment and goes from "what the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, do you want to @ # $%! ???" in 1.2 seconds ... Just bad ... Save an hour and forty minutes and play with your children (or dogs)!
