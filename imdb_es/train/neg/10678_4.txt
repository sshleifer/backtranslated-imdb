This movie looked good: good cast, evergreen theme and an explosive opening. It was downhill from there. Why was it filmed by handheld camera? Shake, judge, part capture scenes and simply confuse the viewer. A bad choice, by the way. As if this were not enough, the worst edition in memory is assumed by a drugged spectator, obligatory if he wants to enjoy it at all. And then he commits the worst sin of all. After taking the viewer to all kinds of improbable and improbable scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they put credits without revealing the outcome, the end, the reward, what was the reason? How can you expect to succeed making thrillers without an ending? Doh! This movie had a great promise and ended up making a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort of the writer and director.
