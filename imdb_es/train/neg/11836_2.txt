Ultimately, too silly and meaningless. Yes, there is the metaphor of the golden cage, but probably most children miss it. Forgettable. Instantly. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we have come to expect, super real. The plot could best be described as thin but tenacious. Although the end seemed arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The underground world of the sewer is a suitably unpleasant reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money also seem to count very much there. Oh, yes, and there is a romantic interest in the fact that the woman is the smartest, the most intelligent and the most acquired of the couple; this in itself is rapidly becoming a stereotype (anti) stereotype. Probably your children will love it.
