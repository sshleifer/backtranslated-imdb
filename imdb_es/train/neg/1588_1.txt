This was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this movie was mainly to show the newcomers, who were very good for the newbies, but above all, the movie was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all the shots, one would think that the police would have intervened. Even the coin of being a bug in Sean was stupid. The way that Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is the error, was not realistic. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie hit quickly. Poor job Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The countdown to the end was not synchronized with anything. It took more time to fight. And what a coincidence, every time Billy went to shoot Sean, he ran out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was ridiculous. He was so stupid when Sean hits him in the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
