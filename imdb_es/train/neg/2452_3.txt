Seeing this again recently, I found it comforting to see how they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the reduced budget and the comfortable actors meant an inevitable failure. In any objective measure, this was a disaster, but it was easy for me to imagine how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone were to do it with sincerity, and with the money to employ the artists and scriptwriters more talented Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, that will not be possible for long. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any kind of budget, this story simply could not be filled up. Fantasy only provides so many opportunities to make an interesting film. There were many moments in this movie that were potentially more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did, although, of course, you always have to use your imagination due to poor performance. The way they tried to show the world of the specters from Frodo's point of view, for example. Or the way Galadriel showed Sam what was happening at home for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really appreciated in this version: the moments of silence. There were times when a dialogue was discussed without background music against a fixed wallpaper. Compare that to the great swooping camera of Jackson's films and the intrusive score that seemed designed to highlight how each scene was the most moving and powerful scene we had ever seen. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, they were calmer and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and his colleagues achieved this with more than US $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million more for marketing. , a huge tax cut from the New Zealand government, and he also made huge savings when filming in New Zealand, not in the US. UU However, despite the marketing claims, the intention to be faithful was never there. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said it in an interview, when she said that they deliberately did not read the books again before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy movie "in the line of" Lord of the Rings, and that the one he really wanted to do was the King's Return, because he had many battles but no character development. . <br /> <br /> In contrast, this movie tried to be truer. Of course, many things were wrong, the performance was horrible and practically sank everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally, they cut a lot and adapted other scenes, and for this they deserve credit. While Jackson added many action scenes that did not serve the purpose of the plot, Bakshi cut scenes from books that did nothing to advance the plot anyway. In fact, there is a curious similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films near the beginning, since both deviate from the original books in the same way, although, of course, some of this might be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> This was not a good movie, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview to the Onion AV club that only animation could do justice to the Lord of the Rings. His version did not work, but he could have been right.
