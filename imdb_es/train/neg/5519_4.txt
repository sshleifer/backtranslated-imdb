Ok, the previews of this movie just tell you that a young rebel goes to live with her grandmother during the summer to get ready. That is not really the case! It is a rebellious young woman of 17 years who reveals a secret and it is up to her mother to believe if she tells the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I did not enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan's performance. Actually, this movie would have been great if they had had someone else, maybe a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes away a lot from the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I think that if you put it Lindsay apart, you will enjoy this movie. The ending is quite big (and sad).
