I just watched this movie last night and, being a person who had very low expectations to begin with, I was still disappointed. The most obvious error in this abomination of a movie is that the main point of the plot (the boy who was awake during the surgery) had NOTHING to do with the result. It would have ended equally as well. So, what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 trials for malpractice against him and did he not think that people would ask questions if a patient died at his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba lacks talent and Christiansen is almost as bad. Everything was laughable from beginning to end. I'm pretty sure that if you could feel someone piercing your chest with a scalpel, you would feel more pain than that.
