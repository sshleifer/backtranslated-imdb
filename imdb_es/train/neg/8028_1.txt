Please! Do not waste money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch scam made by some high school kids. I could not finish watching it, and I usually like to watch all kinds of series movies. How the hell could they find a distributor for it? !!! Funny though: Check out Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money that should have been spent on actors, camera and editing. Even that would not have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark zone" has already received too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making movies like that ... you're not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
