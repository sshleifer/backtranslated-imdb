This movie is terrible TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies in history. I can not even imagine Gigli being worse than this. The previews made us say "NO", but after looking for something in the middle of the dreck there, we decided to go ahead and give it a try. <br /> <br /> STUPID. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. It's an image and it can look good with explosions, but not even the guy Bruce Willis got in "Die Hard." If he took off his shirt and ran fighting with bad guys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara, she is always good. Gandolfini fails again (if it were not for The Sopranos, he would wash) as he did in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck monopolizes all scenes and, as others have said, there is no character. He has some motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.
