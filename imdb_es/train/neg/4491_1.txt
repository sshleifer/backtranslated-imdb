1/10 and that's just because I'm not going lower with my grades. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie of the "Trilogy", do not buy it or rent it. Trust me, you will not miss anything. the Architect does not bring new information: _ (spoiler) _ there has been more NEO before him, it is like nr.6 or something like that. You could already imagine something like that in the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first Matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where have I seen this before? Oh, right in the first movie, the roles were reversed! Like the action scenes, nothing new only with more opponents. the action scene (the more than 20 ships) in the BIG battle we did not see (maybe in Revolutions?), betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy who held the knife and wanted to stab Neo?) EGM soon. <br /> <br /> in general, a cheeky tactic to make money (especially from the guys who went to see it more than once), which evidently worked like a charm.
