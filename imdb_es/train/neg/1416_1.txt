Strange ... I like this whole team of films and movies in black humor; But I did not like this at all! It's horrible, horrible and surely nothing funny. The pity can not make a complete plot of the film, dislike neither. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; It could have been eliminated It should have been in another shorter format, surely. Maybe he expected too much from the crew, how to save the movie hahaha. It is also full of overused clichés of characters and situations ... I do not understand why people liked it ... "Poesía", "esperanza"; No, mom, I did not see any of that! ^^ In general, it is empty and raw, pitiful and hopeless. Oh, damn this ........
