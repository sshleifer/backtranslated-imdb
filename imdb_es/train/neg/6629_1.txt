If you've seen the 1975 Sholay, do not watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the 1975 Sholay, go see it. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could have gone wrong when making a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychopath at best (Probably the 40 minutes of the reel that should not be burned). If you eliminate the rest of the movie and only see Amitabh playing with his character, it would still be worth watching. But as insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason I think that Raj was assigned to Prashant Raj is because he looks a lot like Amitabh in his youth. Sushmita Sen gets along well, with grace and makeup. But the prize for the "WORST performance and any role to date" must be for Nisha Kothari. She manages to degrade her performance to such levels that even the drama of high school would eclipse her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
