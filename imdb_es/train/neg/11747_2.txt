Although he got some favorable press after playing in Toronto Intl. Film festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. One: it's a very low budget Canadian movie. Two: It is written, directed and performed by the same person (usually a bad sign, unless they are Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But even though I saw it with low expectations, it was a much bigger disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In a few words: bad script, bad acting, terrible direction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. He claims to be a comedy, but I just laughed twice. Also, there is horrible music at full volume. How this got some attention, I'll never know.
