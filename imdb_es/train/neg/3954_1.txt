The full movie is flashbacks to Boogeyman's first film and, in an inexplicable way, images from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves movie. It is framed with some more current images (from the beginning of the 90s) that are boring, badly performed and cheap. Not only is the movie almost completely flashbacks, but it will REPEAT the same flashbacks throughout the film. So you see the recycled material again and again, as if you had not seen it already. As if the originals were not bad enough. I had never seen a movie so padded ... Someone was pulling the last dollar out of these movies. Total scam And talk about the stuffing ... why do I have to write 10 lines about this garbage? If I can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines, that should be enough.
