I'm not really sure how to begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies, since they tend to be the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and inept direction. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all those qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch include the Thunderchild, the woman crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train crash ... Wow, there are so many negative effects! However, on the positive side, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done. <br /> <br /> The acting was as bad as it could have been, since it was based directly on the H.G. book. Wells. For having such good source material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so exaggerated as to make it fun. And then there's the mustache ... the piece of facial hair that most distracts me in a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains acting. The rest are characters that walk aimlessly and ineffective effects. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different color filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds even in internal scenes, the poor green projection, it is surprising to me how this man got approval to direct a film. I do not imagine that it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who wants to watch this movie is do what I did: invite some friends who enjoy bad movies, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe do it all the way through It makes an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh silly with this disaster.
