Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif ... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good flag. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> It's not a good reason not to see this movie ... <br /> <br /> Or at least that I thought ........ Not these people did JBJ ... <br /> Why or why I forgot that. <br /> <br /> Despite all the criticism, the first half of the movie is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There is some intrigue and you FEEL THAT I HAVE A MIXED IRRITATION ORDER WITH THE EXCITATION THAT I KNOW WHILE I SEE GUY RITCHIE MOVIES LIKE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a kind of very thin model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, since only he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying but a little funny, you almost forget most of the times you can not understand it. <br /> <br /> Saif is next to Main Khiladi ... once again. <br /> <br /> There are occasional laughs and some giggles. s, and a few during the love story of kareena-saif (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> BUT MAJORLY THIS MEDIA PROMISES MORE THAN WHAT IT OFFERS ... <br /> <br /> WHAT MAKES THE SECOND PART EVERYTHING MORE INCREDIBLE ... <br /> < There was almost an ovation when the interval occurred not only because the kareena was wet from what people thought were things to come. <br /> <br /> IN THE PLACE OF US WE TREAT TO THE MIND NUMBERING THE TORTURE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT IN WORDS. <br /> <br /> Saif is suddenly cured as a comic companion ... <br /> <br /> DREAMLY MRS. LADY KAREENA IS SEEN ANOREXIC, YOU RECEIVE THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS EMPTY AND YOUR FACE DATES TO BIG FOR YOUR BODY (only the girls can notice this and make others see that the second last floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND ITS SIDEKICKS FIND ITS NERVOS. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who takes the madness to a certain point, but even he becomes intolerable after a while. <br /> <br /> ALL THE SAME TIME IS SUBJECT TO SECURITY AFTER THE OTHER. WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! WHAT I HAVE DONE TO DESERVE THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective gasp passed through the audience before each song in the second half, which was normal even without the movie around it. <br /> <br /> I can no longer relieve the trauma ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE BEGINS LIKE A BUZZ THAT YOU FEEL COULD BECOME A HIGH BUT BECOMES SLOW MOVEMENT TOWARDS A HEADACHE AND, THEN, RETURNS QUICKLY TO A COMPLETE MIGRANATE ATTACK. <br /> <br /> Please, do not watch this movie for any reason that is not of academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who a lot of confusion (need a book to fill this). <br /> <br /> + s cast, the second half full (many pages are needed to complete this). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid 1s and 2s, they do not seem extreme, but make no mistake, this movie is unappealable no matter how decent the first half is).
