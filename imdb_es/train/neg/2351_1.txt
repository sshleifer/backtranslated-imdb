I have no idea how someone managed to stay awake during this show. The performance was hard and amateur, the story was an old news and the development of the plot (or the lack of it) invariably made my eyelids sink less than half of each episode. That's all there is to be said about it, because it really lacked substance of any kind. <br /> <br /> How can people like this shit? It's stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it more thoroughly ... It's as if some of you look at this garbage without thinking only because they like the appearance of some actors, or because, for some crazy reason, they do not have it. I've seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just ... I forget it. This show stunk, and fortunately it's gone forever. I would like them to go to work to demolish The O.C. once and for all.
