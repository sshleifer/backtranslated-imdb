They played this in the Twilight Zone marathon on July 4 and this is, without a doubt, the worst episode of the Twilight Zone I've seen. It is completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Even though Twilight Zone is a fairly uneven series and many episodes end up being totally predictable, this one was completely out of place. Compare this with legendary episodes like "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize there's no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such a terrible material, and frankly I'm surprised that someone from his historical comedy would be inclined to the level of this episode. Even though he seemed to be struggling, he MUST have needed the money ... there is no other explanation.
