Marty (Simon Scuddamore), the nerd of the school, is sexually humiliated by a group of classmates and then finds himself in a laboratory explosion (which is also yours) where his face is marked by acid. Years later, all the idiots are invited to the high school (since they closed) for a meeting. What they did not know is that Marty is inviting them to kill them. Then a storm begins, they are locked in the school and Marty begins to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and bloody and there are some spooky atmospheric shots of the deserted school, but that's it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is stripped naked, his head is sunken in a toilet and burns) and is simply uncomfortable to watch. Considering that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after its release, it is almost impossible to see them. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is a full front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but a girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER knowing that a murderer is roaming for them! And then there is the couple that has to have sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone is going to be and can teleport himself. It ends with a twist that made me moan and roll my eyes and then another turn that made me want to throw something heavy at the TV! The performance is bearable, not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is also in this. She is a very beautiful woman, but she is not a great actress. <br /> <br /> This becomes a 3 for some murders and effectively bloody environments. Otherwise, it runs from the factory and forgettable. The tragic suicide of Scuddamore has lent this film more attention than it deserves.
