I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman, who one day sees herself passing in her own car. Well, I thought, this could be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. The broken? The Broken ... What? What is broken? The ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, ready! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing in his favor. <br /> <br /> The premise is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, and a pretty mediocre one. A more suitable title would be 'The Boring', since it extracts each scene during bloody times. Or maybe 'The Confused', since it does not explain anything at all, neither in the narrative nor in the story itself, just a vague idea about the evil copies and some, peppered with fears and cheap scenes, but nothing tangible. It is simply messy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the acting and special effects are pretty good, but, again, it's not a difficult role to play. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, maybe a little confused, and not in the style of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor, and do not look at this. In a nutshell, there are better thrillers out there.
