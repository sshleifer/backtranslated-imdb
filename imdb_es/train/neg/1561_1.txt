Whoever has given such favorable reviews to this movie needs to see more movies. <br /> <br /> A loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family. The movie is full of idiots and includes "teabagging" live. That should summarize everything for you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. You may want to watch the whole movie in the hope that it will improve as it progresses, it is not!
