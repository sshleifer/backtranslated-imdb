This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and non-original program produced by Australian television stations to meet local content quotas. The writing was really terrible and I am not surprised that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory, the Honorable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this TV series was funny, not even slightly funny. I was just tired and BAD and, worst of all, I really thought it was fun. It was simply shameful to see him. <br /> <br /> There is something very wrong about this program being awarded to 10 out of 10 in IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer of the program (there were not many) and it is impossible. Or crazy There are loaves of bread that are more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it is on DVD, remember that the laughter you deserve was not intentional.
