American Pie has traveled a great distance since the first. At first I think the actors have no idea what they are doing and, instead, it's just a new version of a college party that went crazy. Story is presented as two freshman college students (with the hanged youth) who dream of going to college just to experience the night parties, sex and, of course, alcohol. The plot is stupid and comes a long way from the original cake. In fact, once again they did not present an apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store and I can rent for free. But remember it's a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and an insane drink. I'm also a teenager and I think even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice.
