I think war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda barely does the first thing. Since Zvezda was a Russian war movie, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, an exuberant score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What he did not need was naive love, bizarre war scenes and abuse of the soundtrack in a film that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, holocaust) only to end the step. but, nevertheless, insulting our sense of history, the final note on the "liberation of Poland". An opportunity lost as a movie but not as propaganda apparently.
