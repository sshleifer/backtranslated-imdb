I saw this movie last week and I had the biggest laugh I've had in a long time. The plot of the film is quite silly and complicated in a badly elaborated way. The only advantage that can be found anywhere in the movie is the impressive abdominals of Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is horrible as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is disgusting and his character is an imbecile above all. And as if the fact that you think she is having sex with her son is not enough, they throw unnecessary saxo solos at every opportunity! The end and the climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable. I mean who the hell wants to take the son of a con man who tried to make you believe he was your son and that you had an incestuous relationship with him.
