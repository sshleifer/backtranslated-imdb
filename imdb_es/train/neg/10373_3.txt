This is one of those movies that I could only see once. Charlotte Henry is fine, in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Of course, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (they face screams for a recognition that did not arrive). The film has just been grouped together without cohesion. Much of the spirit, humor and continuity of Lewis Carrols is lacking. What a pity! It is a great book. I would recommend the 1951 version of Disney.
