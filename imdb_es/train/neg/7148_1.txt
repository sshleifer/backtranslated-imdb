Before watching this movie, I had low expectations and went to see the cars. Eventually I even regretted having gone for that reason. The plot is almost nonexistent. The development of the character does not exist. In the movie there were so many clich√©s and so much amazing cheesiness that I could only stare and ask myself how it was released. If it were not for the exotic, I would not even have qualified this movie as 1. An attempt at a coherent storyline is destroyed by the absolute absurdity of this cult of the racing elite and the ridiculous characters that make up its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple to think that an average child could predict most of the story. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. Instead, play Gran Turismo HD and quench your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad taste.
