I really hate this delayed show, IT'S THE SAME! in a big way, and personally I think it's an insult for the fairy type (if you believe in fairies); I mean the people who have had so much shit should examine their heads, right? and there is also a LOT of madness (the evil schoolmaster, which I think is getting very old) and also stupidity (the parents of the child and the godfather of the fairies) in this show, two of the things that I arranged and detest around the world. (especially stupidity). <br /> <br /> In general, I say that this show is so annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at all (I would bleed it to death)!
