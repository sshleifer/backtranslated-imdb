The only nice thing about this highly simulated movie is playing "guess" that location. What Toronto landmark will represent the US / international location? <br /> <br /> Who knew that the antichrist would be Russian? obviously it can not be American since we need the pulls to save the day, oh Buck ... you will tell us the whole truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way to get out of the building should those unpleasant antipathers get away with the his. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope they do not do another of these things! We do not have to pray.
