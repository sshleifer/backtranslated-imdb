Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an almost empty apartment building. At first they help each other and then, slowly, the tension between them begins to increase. <br /> <br /> This is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and, unfortunately, everyone talks as if they were in that novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, it is purple and full of nuances of meaning. It is as if a university student of English with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. It is horrible and instantly I found myself immune to everything the movie had to say, which is a shame, since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is a good way, unfortunately none of them can overcome the falsity of the words and the premise. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this movie. While it is not really bad, it is very predicative and pretentious to the point of making you want to get away. I lost interest less than a third of the entry and I had to fight to get to the end. If you're interested, I'd try it on cable, but I would not bet good money to see it.
