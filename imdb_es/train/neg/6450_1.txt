Well, this movie is incredibly horrible. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Those that sometimes appeared with a slight sarcasm, which leads me to believe that they were not taking this film seriously, or anyone who could see this detestable detestable monstrous monster killer. While watching this "Unknown creature" I could not help thinking that there was not much budget or a competent writer in the crew. But, if you look at this to laugh, you will be happy, the film mocks with mockery because I can not see how anyone can see this and be proud to throw this directly to the clich√© of the DVD. I want to be an action / horror thriller. fight of movies to the light.
