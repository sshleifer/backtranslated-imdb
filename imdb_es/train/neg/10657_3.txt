I had high hopes for this film and I saw it with high expectations; Basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an incredible actor who has marked his steps in the arena of time forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. After watching this movie, the brutality and violence in tenebra and orange clock looks much better. <br /> <br /> The Protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring policeman. Who is assigned an investigation of brutal serial murders. Raghavan efficiently finds the thread in this case and is close to solving the murders and putting psychopathic killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars, but they escape and get back into a wave of murders. Finally, Raghavan kills them both after saving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psychological killers are the ones who are going to prevent the public from going to theaters. The murders and sexual harassment and rapes are shown very explicitly, without which the film could have survived. <br /> <br /> Even to imagine that teenagers and children are going to be watching this movie in the cinema and the kind of image that they will surely paint in their minds are not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligation to society and his public. By the way, I never go to the cinema with the name of Gautham on the production list.
