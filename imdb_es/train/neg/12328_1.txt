Obviously it is illegal. Pedophiles pray in things like this. How did you manage to make a movie like that? This movie is summarized in one word, SICK. Where do people come from and watch these kinds of movies? While I was watching the movie, I did not think that this child was really allowed to say: maybe 12 if he really sleeps with this woman. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler for you, but I would not have seen this. Where has the sanity of these people gone? Maybe the creators of this movie are pedophiles? Our current society is full of all kinds of sexual predators that pray for children, but filmmakers make these kinds of movies that only provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that in a previous comment someone asked if there was a version in which they were shown naked. This is a boy here, and someone is asking something like this? What is wrong with this picture?
