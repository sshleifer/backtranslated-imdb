A scientist and his girlfriend are driving when their speeding causes a car accident. He escapes unharmed, but she is beheaded. He saves her head, takes her home and keeps her alive (!!!!). Then he proceeds to look for models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches the head, which begins to speak and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet ... <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is rather stupid, but I had some affection for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this movie about 20 times a year (without exaggerating). They showed him always on Saturday afternoon on television - without cutting. Seeing this on television back then was great! Explicit blood and blood along with a frightful monster and sleazy sexploitation, who cares if it was good? Seeing it now, I realize how bad this really is. <br /> <br /> The acting is perfectly unhappy, the production values ​​are non-existent, the script is quite silly and (aside from the gore still quite disgusting) this is a boring thing. There is also a moderate catfight between two women and the big monster at the end. Also add in a finish that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of an exploitation film from the sixties. On the other hand its absolute garbage. Either way, it's not a good movie, but it's a must-see (just for once) for horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> Also the laughter in the head is pretty creepy. Note the final credits that make the TITLE incorrect (calling it "THE HEAD that would not die")!
