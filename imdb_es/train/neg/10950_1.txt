If I had known that this film had been filmed with the exasperating and indifferent style of Dogme 95, I would never have rented it. However, I took a dramamine for seasickness and gave it a shot. I spent some very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just pretentious boredom. <br /> <br /> The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also quite depressing, but at least the camera was stable and did not let the characters' necks escape. hour. I am baffled by the continued popularity of Dogme 95 abroad: it will develop in the United States at about the same time as the next great outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because it's the average number of times the camera pokes the actors in the eye). <br /> <br />
