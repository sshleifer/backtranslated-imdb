As a young black / Latina woman, I am always looking for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I did not. Although the themes presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story simply did not develop properly. The film kept dragging again and again and many of the characters that appear on the screen simply come and go without contributing much to the film in general. If the director had done a better job interconnecting the scenes, maybe he would have enjoyed it a little more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" about this any day. I just was not very impressed
