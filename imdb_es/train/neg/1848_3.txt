There are bad movies, then there are films that are SO bad, that become almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still somewhat surprised, you know? Looking into space and drooling! It can be said that the people involved (I hope they have changed their names to protect themselves) were having a great time and definitely were not shy. I give this one three out of ten just for the free hit and the REALLY bad effects. I laughed out loud for most of the movie, so I guess you could say he showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the previous words in no way interpret that this is a good movie, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to miss a movie with a GREAT title!
