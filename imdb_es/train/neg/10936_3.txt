I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some good actors but ultimately, it falls flat. He tries too hard to be funny in some places (daughters over jealous attempts to cook), in others (the scene in which they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, although they are slightly interesting, they are really just stuffing (the whole work scene). And I did not find the "villains" intimidating or worthy to hate, even though they seemed very annoying. <br /> <br /> I've met people like the ones in the movie while playing church. And I will say that the referees are right. Even so, in the end, I did not really care much about the characters, or their search for the glory of the church ball. Maybe because they were all so one-dimensional, which would not have mattered so much if the movie was more fun or seemed to flow a little more smoothly in general. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, has made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
