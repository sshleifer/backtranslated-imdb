Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie stinks on so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low-budget retread makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (poor Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard that houses a hidden compartment where his vampire is found killing Antonio. Guitar case of Flags in DESPERADO. Pick up some "hunters" lame on the road (including an annoying and feminist infected girl who takes pills to avoid becoming vampires), and set out to stop a vampire teacher who has no background story and so we could care. less about her or her search (walking in the sunlight stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've seen it, and you've done it much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has been responsible for many bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he has passed his best moment and unable to make another horror classic. The only decent movie he has made since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is a complete rubbish, even the incredibly cheap and retarded MARS GHOST ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are there bigger ones like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING? <br /> <br /> Carpenter friend Wallace proves he can not get out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script full of yawns, moans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention that I hated all the characters in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole movie. How does that happen? This movie has nothing to recommend. Even the presentation on DVD is not good; The menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> In comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY 13 IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. Now, that's how you make a sequel and (re) energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
