The biggest one that bothers me is that they say that Zues takes the DUTCH commands. But she speaks German to him. The 2 languishes are completely different, it's like saying "well, he takes the French commands" and starts speaking in Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor and not a detective in the least. The paper simply does not fit well, even if it is a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comment or reappearances. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at those things, I think it could be a good movie to see if it's ever on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
