A young man has a bad day of hair, goes out on a hill and falls into a place where he can not escape. Then, he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" type of 2,000 years ago as his best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger with similar appearance and sound. Herculean strength helps the child out of danger and then adapts to modern life. So what is the problem? This is the most bad idea for a "family" exit! Either way, this should not have been tried, really! Our fictional character of power and strength is no more than a typical stranger who seems to be common to the rest of the universe. Adding to blasphemy is the lack of something new or attractive, and before you know it, there is an attempt at violence that does not qualify this as "family" entertainment. However, the scene in which Atlas complains about his underpants is choking. Just spend a nice and quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
