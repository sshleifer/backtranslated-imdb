Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not discover it while watching this movie. From what I have collected from other sources, Ms. Page had a great demand in the post-World War II period as the queen of "naughty" photos and that is exactly what this film describes. However, I never got to know Bettie, the woman. His childhood in Tennessee was a combination of a Christian evangelical education and a sordid home life that is only hinted at. The film ignores his personal life and comes to the purpose of the film, the "naughty" images. The characters are presented and abandoned in a few frames, but there are frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras, Bettie in her belt and stockings, Bettie in captivity ... etc. The film goes from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Then we return to its shades of gray life in New York. Gretchen Mol plays Bettie as one of the smartest girls you've ever met. When Bettie confesses to a friend that she missed being her best high school student by getting an A- instead of an A, one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how picturesque the "naughty" photos of Ms. Page seem in 2007. It's really sad to see a woman tied like a pig on a spit does not even succeed on My Space or You Tube . I'm not sure if this movie was written badly or if some crazed editor shredded it. I would only recommend it as a source for people who study the history of strange underwear.
