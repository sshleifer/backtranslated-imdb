The first 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers showed that he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie. Absolutely lower than the common denominator of humor. Painful visualization A complete task. Written without doubt in less than a week, like the first. Give Meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let it out until you've developed a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let the gold members sink without a trace.
