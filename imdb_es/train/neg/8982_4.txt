My nose is slightly out of shape as I write this. A few weeks ago I had sent a comment about this movie that has not yet appeared, so I guess it was rejected, although it met all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> The first time I found this movie was interesting. Thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who has appeared in such important productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything finally sinks under the weight of a really horrible melodramatic script. There is also a large number of free nudes that do nothing to advance the narrative or even give an impressionistic nuance to what would otherwise be a work of art beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> A day trip to the beach in Valencia would make it much less arduous than having to find these fictitious characters again anywhere, at any time.
