If an author is given 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the film begins, and the first shot shows the author rolling on a bed in lycra shorts, it will not be a surprise to note that the author has the body type that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of look that could be useful for a homosexual aversive therapist. <br /> <br /> Others have given this thing the way it deserves. For me, the most unfortunate moment occurred when the trip from Los Angeles was represented by an airplane that landed in what appeared to be LAX; and the return was represented by a shot from a FedEx cargo plane.
