I suppose this movie is an appropriate homage to the first Superman movie, since it is as horrible and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After an opening scene that consists only of muddled intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the futuristic superlative credits of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is something more murky. Ma Kent sees a kind of cloudy noise on the farm, and spends a good part of my life walking slowly towards some debris in the cornfield. Then, Superman approaches her and faints. <br /> <br /> Next, we find Lex Luthor in a scene about many dark close-ups of an old woman when she dies. We do not see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early example of the film's impulse to leave no stone stuck without spinning. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he's not human. Also, he probably does not like humans either, since the movie sometimes presents some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill the majority of Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent appears again in his previous work (I forgot to mention that he had been absent on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then he discovers that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and is dating Cyclops. It bothers him so much that he loses control of his super strength to the point that he accidentally breaks the frame of an image. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Ms. Lane is on some type of aircraft connected to some. type of space shuttle. It is an important type of event, since it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room that monitor this event. There are also people who watch it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved in interrupting them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> As the events that led to the inevitable disaster began to build, I apologized for a soda. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and saw that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but somehow I entered the Prairie Home Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then came the time to stop wasting time. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first cinema, found my seat and looked up to see that the impending disaster of the Space Shuttle Lois Lane was almost upon us. Still, it seemed like it was taking forever, so I wandered the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him to college. While attending the graduation of my son's medical school, I remembered that I should probably sign up for Superman Returns, so I apologized and went back to the theater only to find out that there was no need to hurry. Another half hour passed before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was very good. <br /> <br />. And then there is a secondary plot in which Superman becomes really creepy and starts to harass Lois Lane and her family with her X-ray vision and super hearing. Then she tries to cheat Cyclops, who seems to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor participates in some kind of contest to show all the possible behaviors of generic villains before the end of the movie. . I forgot to take my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things start to prepare for the cloudy grand finale. I think maybe the projector was broken, because the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing turbid things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman improving, going back to the murky things, being sick again, no, wait, it's okay again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor unleashed his latest version. bad boy movement: shout a little to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home where he lived felt a little cold. I realized that I left my sweatshirt in the theater and went to look for it. When I did, I was a little surprised to discover that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some of the spectators what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray beards. <br /> <br /> I sat in my old seat and watched Lois Lane wander around her house. for a moment. Then Superman appeared and began to quote the beginning of the movie, and since I saw that part, I thought it was good to leave it. <br /> <br /> So that's my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Oh, too, if you like jokes about people who eat dogs or jokes about a dog that eats another dog, you will love this movie. Because there are two jokes like that in him.
