The movie My Name is Modesty is based on an episode that occupies approximately one page of Blaise's tenth novel, called Night of the Morningstar. Describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, mid-twenties in the movie) affirms her leadership in a war for a casino. As this is established before the real adventures of Blaise, his trusted partner Willi Garvin is not in the film. That is one of the main problems, since the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was undoubtedly one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long-running comic strip. The other problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring because it's really just a small episode in a script. The casting is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing like the heroine and she is actually too old for the role of the young Modesty. I get the impression that this movie was a quick and dirty solution to not lose the rights of the Blaise franchise.
