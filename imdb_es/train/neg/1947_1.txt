I am 17 years old and I still like most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love the movies of the 1990s, and recently we were invited to one of the best Scooby Doo DVD releases of this decade, Scooby Doo and King Goblin, which I did not expect was as good as it was. Anyway, go back to get a clue! I saw some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed at all. First, I hated animation. It was flat, deflated and very busy on Saturday morning, standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some programs that I really hate had slightly better animation. Worse still, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to previous episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. He also hated character changes, because it seemed that instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby now played to be superheroes, something they would never have done in the movies or Scooby-Doo. Where are you? show. The melody of the subject was not very good, I can not even remember it, and the jokes were unconvincing. However, I do recognize that there is a list of very talented voices, if they had had better material and they would not have been told to sound as different from the original voices as humanly possible, which they could add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was horrible, and I'm not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
