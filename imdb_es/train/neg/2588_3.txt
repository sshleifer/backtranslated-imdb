Band Camp was horrible, The Naked Mile was a bit better, and this third consecutive DVD in the American Pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) broke up with his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join cousin Erik Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. With the promise of many parties, lots of alcohol and enough hot girls in Casa Beta, they only have fifty enumerated tasks that must be done to become official privileged members. But a threat appears with rivals, GEK ("Geek") House, led by a power hungry nerd (and Shagger Shagger) that Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offers bigger and better than what Beta has. To solve it once and for all, Beta and Gek go to battle with the forbidden, for forty years, the Greek Games to win over each other, with the loser in motion. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenstein, also known as Jim's Dad (the only usual Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees people unhooking bras, a gladiatorial duel that floats in the water, trapping a greased pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse's sperm, wife carrying and drinking a barrel full of alcohol (with vomiting not disqualifying). It all comes down to sudden death, with a guy who makes a stripper dance, and they have to resist the bullfights, Beta House wins when Edgar runs with a girl dressed like a sheep in his lap. Also starring Christopher McDonald of Flubber as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity increases slightly, as does the rudeness of the jokes, and I could guess that it was rated one out of five, but I like it. Suitable!
