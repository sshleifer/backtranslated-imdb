A dog found in a local kennel mates with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family that has just lost its previous dog by a stroke and a stroke. The puppy does not need time to do like Donald Trump and fire the Mexican housekeeper, what a holiday. Only the father suspects that this canine is more than it seems, the rest of the family loves the demonic dog. So it's up to dad to say the day. <br /> <br /> These late 70's made for the horror movie on television have nothing to do except a sense of nostalgia out of place. When I saw him as a child, I discovered that he was a tense nail biter, but seeing him as an adult, I now realize that he is simply bored, bored and not very well acted in the least. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
