Am I wrong or is the 2007 version just a scam from the original? I have to ask because the DVD that I just bought is one of the worst movies I've seen ... bad acting, bad editing, etc. ... the only aspect of "exploitation" here is how we were ripped off for our money by buying this piece of garbage. It's nothing more than a lightweight porn movie ... there's no real gore, no scary images, just a little cheap trash. If someone wants to see an excellent movie without renowned actors, a bit of blood and a decent story ... get Baby Blood ... also with a cheap budget but well done ... and also a real story! I Spit was a waste of money, but I'll save it just to laugh ... it's pathetic! New comment ... September 3 ... I'll keep this movie forever just because, therefore, it's bad, it's almost good ... in a very bad way ... the worst performance of all ... a classic of the real movie shit!
