Live! Yes, but do not kick. <br /> <br /> Real story: Some time ago, a Dutch television channel announced that they were going to broadcast a new reality show. A contest rather. The main participant in this program would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and would be donating her kidneys to a person with luck with progressive renal failure. Really. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media covered this whole story like flies in a turd, saying that it was frightening, immoral, to what this world comes from and so on. . In a way, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the tension increased to the point that the government was mainly occupied with the question of whether they should let this show go on or not, instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The program aired and until the last moment they were moving forward. And until the last moment, the country was in arms, the Prime Minister delivered speeches, all newspapers wrote about it, everyone in the country held their breath. And the network went ahead. Towards a new frontier in television. And they definitely managed to do just that. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show went on the air and we all saw a woman with a terminal illness who selected the right candidate to receive her kidneys so that she would live, while she would die soon after. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was revealed that it was a partial deception. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no auction of kidneys. The whole show, which, with the commercials and commercials and all the discussions, developed over months for a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of the greater shortage of organ donors. The man who founded this particular network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now THIS is television. Leaving everyone far behind in amazement. <br /> <br /> Do not make me a badly acted and misdirected movie about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette program on American television. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I was going to believe that they would get this through the FCC. As if I would believe that this would happen through the Supreme Court of the USA. UU On the basis of free expression. As if I was going to believe the final ridicule where this woman achieved it and has problems of conscience because a guy shot himself in the air. <br /> <br /> Everything has been done before. See Running Man with Arnold in place. At least it had a semi-good ending. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terribly bad movie, along with a ridiculous ending. Then, in the end, they shoot him, is that supposed to make us feel better that the movies are made public after we left the theater because there was some kind of justice? Do not trust my word, but I would say this: leave this alone and observe a test pattern, you will get more quality.
