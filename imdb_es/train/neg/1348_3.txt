This animated movie by Inspector Gadget is pretty boring. The story is very weak and there is little action. Most of the characters have little or nothing to do. The movie is slightly entertaining, but it's not going anywhere and it's pointless.it can be seen, but it's fair and it does not come close to the caliber of the animated TV show of the 80s. It's not a movie that has to be seen repeatedly, at least in my mind. It only lasts about 74 minutes, including credits, so I guess that's a good thing. Unlike the television program, the characters are not worth it because here. In the program, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but anyway, who really cares, that's just my opinion. Inspector The last case of Gadget is a disappointing 3/10
