This film was missing ... everything: history, acting, surprise, wit and soul. Fifteen minutes later, he was looking at the screen saying, "How could all these guys meet up and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" In another fifteen minutes, he prayed as much as possible of Amanda Peet. When a bad movie silently raises its ugly head, a sweet eye is a good consolation. But there was not much of that! Deceived on all fronts!
