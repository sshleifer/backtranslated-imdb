My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I also like it, but in general I have found that I should "stick to what it does best" and focus on comic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the movie. The story was predictable. I realize that it was inspired by a real story. But, my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even holding the truth in the story. None of the characters was well developed. There was a parallel story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. More important, however, would have been a deeper exploration of the "child's" mother. It would have been interesting to deepen his psychological profile. She obviously has a long history that was not mentioned, except in the most superficial way. If my husband was not such a Williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes. Too bad I can not get back my $ 20 or 2 hours.
