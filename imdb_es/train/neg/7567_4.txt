The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she begins to believe that she is actually a cyborg. At the institution, he meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg ...' is a big deviation from a family territory and (unfortunately) stronger. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that tries to do something different. God knows, we're all subject to enough junk in our local cinemas. The main point about the movie that I have to say is that it does not say anything about mental illness, nor does it create the characters that interest you. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the strangest things I've seen. I've seen it in years ... but weird is not enough. There is no heart in the movie ... only surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All the characters try to make sense of their own problems, but it is Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.
