This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental papilla. I guess the production values ​​are fine, decent photography, discreet direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never became very interested in him, and this film validates that perception. No wonder he has never had any kind of career apart from his "Star Wars" movies. I'll just say "Buh-bye, Mark" as he sinks into the well-deserved darkness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts stole the show completely. She showed charm, beauty and acting chops, all in one performance. I remember seeing her recently in "Texasville" and having taken note of her beauty. It is interesting to see it from ten years before. Anyway, unless you're interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie screaming in the hills.
