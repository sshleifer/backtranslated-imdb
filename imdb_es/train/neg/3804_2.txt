This is a bad movie by any standard. The story in Match Point had some intrigue, and the direction and writing of a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixes his own culture with the classic English murder and explores what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, has none of this. It is badly written, the two drivers are irremediably wooden and the story itself has no interest. The genre that it falsifies requires at least some kind of secondary argument with clever explanations and moorings (why are tarot cards and keys kept under the tubes in locked rooms?). <br /> <br /> Allen's charming and witty versions of various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately his inspiration has abandoned him this time.
