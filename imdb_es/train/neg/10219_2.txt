Soldier Blue is a film with pretensions: pretensions to be a kind of profound statement about the inhumanity of man towards man, about the exploitation of the white man and his brutality towards the indigenous peoples; A scathing, unshakeable and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, I'm sorry, but it miserably fails to be any of those things. What Soldier Blue really is is a pernicious, trite, ill-made, dishonest garbage. <br /> <br /> Another critic here hit the nail on the head by saying that it seems to be a hybrid of two completely different movies. Basically, Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices about the lifestyle of the other and fall in love (ah, blessing): there are two that kill others. from place in a splash movie by Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the repulsive climax, full of blood and soaked with blood, in which adorable Native American children are shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in love. Close-up graphic, and Native American women with large breasts are abused, raped and tied up, without excuse, that is, except at the box office. (The massacre itself, although repulsive in its wrong intention, is very poorly organized and shot, a group of actors with bright red paint stained on them, interspersed with some special effects sequences of decapitation / dismemberment, dismemberment, incidentally, that He used real amputees in his filming, now that's what I call exploitation. <br /> <br /> Forget about all the potatoes you've heard (including the ridiculous comments that start and end the movie) about this as a " protest ", an accusation of American brutality towards the native peoples, this film gives nothing about the difficult situation of Cheyenne, if it had done so, it would have presented some Native American characters, it would have led us to know and worry about the anonymous and innocent innocents face that are killed in the climax, instead, what we get is the stupid white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss (both lousy actors, at least in this), with a lot of blood, guts and cut heads to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> Which one? It's a terrible shame, because there will be a film about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real-life massacres in which the United States (and Great Britain, and all the so-called "civilized" nations) have participated along the centuries (Iraq?). This is simply not that movie.
