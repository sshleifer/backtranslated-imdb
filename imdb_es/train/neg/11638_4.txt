"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games, a series of adventure games about the rogue writer / paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Prince James of Albany asked Gabriel and his partner, Grace, to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by the so-called "night visitors". When Prince James's son is kidnapped, Gabriel chases the night visitors to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins to put together a mystery related to the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the commercialization, this game is not about vampires. . Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but never command the center stage, as did the voodoo search in "Sins of the Fathers" or the werewolves in "The Beast Within." Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to discover the true nature of vampires, or to investigate the history of vampires. Although vampires kill three people during the course of the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> A large part of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight The deliveries were in the relationships Gabriel formed with the villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help sympathizing with the villain, and therefore, the villain became more human and less monster. However, in "Blood of the Sacred," Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a simple and cheesy interview, which does nothing for the villain to become the player. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gabriel and Grace. In this mystery they are quite useless. Gabriel spends his time snooping on the identities of members of a group of treasure hunters who stay at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing more than a false clue. Grace devotes her time to investigate the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research becomes superfluous by the presence of a disconcerting ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this disconcerting Ally and its polar opposite, the vampire leader, are unbearable. The ally leaves clues to the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in broad daylight and hopes that Grace (and not the other treasure hunters of the tourist group) will find them. However, he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in full on day 1, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. And in the end, he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the vampire leader does not achieve the goals of centuries of intrigue, because he chooses to abstain from acting for two days afterwards. The kidnapping of the child. The only reason given for his decision to delay the action is that he wants to savor his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better if you had focused exclusively on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and the vampires should have been omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican to discover the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. Given that Gabriel is portrayed more than once as a reluctant Catholic, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> Overall, the game was a disappointing installment in the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
