I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from New York. After 30 minutes, I said, "You have to be kidding. Is this a kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the dumbest movies ever made. "What is that supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda movie made for children?" The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst for most of the directors and, frankly, the people who see this kind of nonsense and think that it has something to do with life, love or even life after death, which offers a vision incredibly idiotic ... I need some help psychiatry. Please, if someone tries to save it to your DVD or video player, consider it as a virus introduced in your computer ... it will not destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had done Razzies in the 40s, this would have won in all categories. (PS It also goes through the dubious nickname of "Stairway to Heaven").
