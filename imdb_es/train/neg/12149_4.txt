Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses tries to be a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be applied to how the United States tries to control the media during the Iraq War, but ends up feeling empty. There is never really any tension in the story and the acting is never very good. The worst thing is that the direction of the film is atrocious, it focuses more on odd camera angles that do not transmit anything beyond "This is not a strange way of holding the camera" The special effects are pretty bad ... in a point, the video of an explosion is projected in green over the city, and in the best of cases it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie has a couple of bright spots ... namely, announcements for post-zombie services (including a recovery service and a party bus). But it's too little to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but there is much more ingenuity, humor and talent behind it.
