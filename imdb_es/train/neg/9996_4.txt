While the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are definitive improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": the habit, the commercial garbage that is submerged (this time literally) is a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packed plane that is hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea (all advertising said it was close to the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of it in the film). When the rescue ships come to lift the plane out of the water, we see that all their cranes fall (rather blindly) into the ocean and it is hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes covering the plane, the passengers and the waterlogged script). The NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be the "director's cut", with at least one additional hour of filming, mostly flashbacks, injected into the process with all the subtlety of an episode of "The Island of Gilligan." The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have a bit of fun: Lee Grant is a nasty drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, a sensible stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting on the old ones. Still, personality conflicts and unbearable military details finally tear patience. ** since ****
