Well then. I just watched a lot of movies, all with different degrees of quality. I was not sure which one I wanted to check first. Then he hit me like a sack of rats: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity does not lead anyone and is painfully boring to sit down. And it's about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... really fucking original. "Food of the gods" or "Willard" to someone? They were better than this, and that does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Okay, this is the story: Inna's lab, the scientist and his brave assistant, are experimenting with rats and their laboratory. he's in a shitty neighborhood and in a shitty building, and the stupid buddies of the brave assistant are drunk and they all become food for crazy rats and almost everyone dies and, oh yeah, there's a giant rat that looks awful, but it kills in the end. There, all in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Pfff! I am sorry I disagree! The second, we all realize that there is a giant rat, we all know that it will eventually die !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I saw it for free, but for everyone else ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt it, it did not help: <br /> <br /> --Um ... well. the blood was decent. - Medium media cinematography. <br /> <br /> - CC rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - ... and in other shots, CG rats were pathetically cheap. Look, if your movie has a low budget, maybe you should not trust CG. Lesson to take seriously. <br /> <br /> - The acting is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are more than interesting, we have a mixture of clich√©s and none of them is so well done. . <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - A stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - A giant rat looks like a fat man with a badly conceived bear costume, that was fun enough, but not funny enough to give this film any value. <br /> <br /> - Retrospective, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All the people who take rat university students are drinking tequila from huge jugs of plastic milk, and yet, they do not seem to be drunk for more than a few seconds. Way to maintain continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - This movie is bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you can imagine. It's not even ridiculously bad like, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now those movies are crap that you can enjoy. Even if they make you more stupid. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - The final action movie lame, complete with unharmed heroes and blast. Because he did not feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity, but it still stunk. <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was taking care of my son occasionally during the movie, so it is possible that he lost it, but he was supposedly there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialog: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for time) Writing: 1/10 Address: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> General: 1/10 <br /> <br /> See it only if You love horror movies based on rats and bugs. Wait ... Check that. Do not look at it. It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
