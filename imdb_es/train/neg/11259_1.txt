I gave 1 to this movie. I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the most important directors of Italian cinema, made a film like this, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are insubstantial, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only things I keep in this film are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola radically changes the themes and style in his next film.
