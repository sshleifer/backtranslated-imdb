"After the First World War, an expedition representing the allied countries is sent to Cambodia to stop the efforts of Count Mazovia in the creation of a zombie as an army of soldiers and workers, hoping to avoid a possible outbreak of the war due to the actions of Mazovia, the group presses through the jungle to Angkor Wat despite the dangers.The group includes Armand, who has his own agenda contrary to the wishes of the group ", according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Heads up! The zombie makeup department rebelled before the cameras started rolling. <br /> <br /> In addition, this "Revolt of the zombies" has little to do with its supposed predecessor "White Zombie" (1932) *****, starring Bela Lugosi. If the zombies in that movie did not thrill you, this one will not. A Dean Jagger younger than usual (as Armand Louque) plays an obsessive man with the blonde Dorothy Stone (as Claire Duval). A couple of supporting performances are good: the diabolical Roy D'Arcy (as Mazovia) and the subordinate Teru Shimada (as Buna); however, neither of them is given enough material to really get him out of the garbage dumps. <br /> <br /> ** Revolt of the Zombies (1936) Victor Halperin ~ Dean Jagger, Dorothy Stone, Roy D'Arcy
