Look, I loved the movie OWNERS of Anchorman, but this was really bad. The kind of evil that makes you want to recover that moment in your life, the kind of evil that makes you think "what they thought to film this in the first place", the kind of evil that makes you wish had taken 50 minutes more to Go into the kitchen for a snack during the movie, the kind of evil that makes leprosy look fun, the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you had rented a Pauly Shore movie instead ... Seriously, I can not explain how bad this was. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... there was some entertaining laughter, but they are all much less fun than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but all the secondary plot that was left out of Anchorman that did it here was really excluded for a good reason ... it was not even a little good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the US, a favor), and do not watch this DVD ... it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you do not want to do that. <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm fine now.
