This direct video duplicator is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis' career. As is the tradition of Disney, the quality is sacrificed in the name of a fast charge; This is a lazy renegade with Moranis shrinking accidentally and with some relatives so they can repeat the best scenes from the original movie. The instantly dated visual effects and disheveled dialogue abound in this cheesy, which did nothing but make me think of the days of "The Incredible Shrinking Man," when these kinds of things were done correctly. Surprisingly, this is directed by cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should stay with the day's work or choose better material next time.
