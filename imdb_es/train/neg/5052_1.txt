The squad is for the Vietnam War as Rocky IV for the heavyweight championship. The story of Oliver Stone about the experience of a platoon of the US Army. UU In Vietnam in 1968 it is so exaggerated that it is ridiculous. While most or all occurrences in Platoon occurred over the course of more than 10 years of US military involvement. UU In Vietnam, portraying these things to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks) gives a horribly distorted image of the war. In the peloton, the platoon men see all of the following over the course of a week or two: US soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, a US sergeant who murders another US sergeant, a American soldier who murders a US sergeant Soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, more than 90% dead or injured in the platoon. That Stone tries to pass this film as the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a shame. Two films from the Vietnam War that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and A Bright Shining Lie by HBO.
