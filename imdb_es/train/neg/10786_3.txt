How this movie was made with so many big stars surpasses me. This is a terrible film full of clich√©s with the worst performance that any of these actors has done. It really amazes me that so many of these stars on the A list agree with this movie without grace. What is even worse is the fact that almost 100 million are made here in the states. However, it seems that the big stars can make money, even if the movie is terrible. I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snoring festival. Billy Crystal did everything possible with what was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the movements. Whatever you do, do not be fooled by the excellent cast because nobody could have saved this.
