I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs organized Monstervision on TNT. Even he could not make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I saw it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure that my students never did anything so bad ... but it took all my intestinal strength to see it. It's like watching your great-grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... terribly painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the actual movie, you submerged it in paint thinner, then you watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the gangue compartment in S-Mart, get away from it like a rattlesnake.
