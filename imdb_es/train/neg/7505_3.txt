This long film turns out to be less about Berkowitz and its effect on New York City, but more about the cartoon painting of a certain group of Italian-Americans, locally known as "Guidos." The problem is that the "Guidos" are not interesting, no matter what kind of history or scenario they are immersed in. They are already living cartoons, so Lee only amplifies them, instead of just portraying them. <br /> <br /> When someone has a caricature of themselves, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make the ears and nose even bigger!" That's what Lee has done in this The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" lifestyle, end up with an uninteresting plot for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and get a good movie to fall asleep, especially considering it's a long running time. <br /> <br /> One more blow against him: for someone who claims to be a Yankees fan, and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is spelled incorrectly in the final credits.
