I'll be brief ... This movie is a shame for everyone, except for its director of photography. The very fact that it is a criticism of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we "treat" a persistent dance scene. The plot is ridiculous, nobody except the most fervent fan of BAD horror will get something from it. And for the love of God, please stop saying that this movie is a story of lost innocence or even female empowerment because it clearly is not (child lesbians, what the hell?). This was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), even someone collapsed in the middle of the movie, probably because they could not take it anymore. This may seem a too critical tirade, but I really can not find a redeeming feature of this movie, except maybe if you take it as pure comedy. In summary, this movie is best seen in a class A drug cocktail.
