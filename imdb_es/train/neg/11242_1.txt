I saw this movie last month in a free preview and I went out. It was pretty horrible. In the process of trying too hard, they acted in excess and made a horrible movie. I felt disappointed because I felt that all the actors had made respectable decisions in the past, so this could not be so far from the brand, but I was wrong. I was hoping they would give a poll at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release it. I was attracted to the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of time and, in general, I have a lot of fun. He tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, the ideas and the filming, but because they gathered so many ideas at once, he failed. Normally I am not very demanding with movies and I do not usually feel the need to show my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to see them. I registered in IMDb just to tell everyone.
