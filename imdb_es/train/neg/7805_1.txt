Usually, an actor's first film is something that one can afford to lose. It's often the first job where the lack of cinematic experience of everyone involved is really on display, and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> But it's worse than that, even by 1982 standards, this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. Shot entirely in the Chicago area with an obviously small budget, most of the performances of the entire cast are rigid, wooden and caricatured: a cross between a high school play and a bad community theater. The noise of nearby traffic often stifles dialogue, and dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that is forced and convenient rather than natural and organic. The scenes are artificial and choppy, and although the characters go through a lapse of years, neither children nor adults age at all. <br /> <br /> I think it is possible to make a Christian film that is acceptable to a large secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'The Message' or, in this case, on his own autobiographical ties with the project, that the good values ​​of film production are discarded. (I'm sure it's not a coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor, and cast member). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting, and credible, for Mira in his later films. Careers like yours certainly are not based on movies like this.
