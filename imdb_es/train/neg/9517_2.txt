Vicente Minelli's films are usually worth their time; Find me in San Luis, the bad and the beautiful. I waited for this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is scene after scene of fatalism going nowhere. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing disappointment that endures him, living in disappointing digs while a girl convinces him to finish his disappointing writing project. The film has a great dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is intended to be full of tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not realize that the scene is a clich√© of wheezing and the characters are so drawn and poorly developed that we do not particularly care that they are shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the constipated characters who stand around the bars and the living rooms and get nervous for two hours. Hell IS other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There is nothing happening in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after World War II is handled more skillfully in "The best years of our lives". And any of Inge's two products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic', covers the desperation of being stuck in a dead-end city, with much more turmoil.
