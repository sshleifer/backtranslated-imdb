In fact, I prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (for example, Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World according to Garp). These are my favorite movies of Robin Williams. But Seize the Day, although well acted, is one of the worst movies I've seen and certainly the worst movie by Robin Williams (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <Every good story will have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is a giant below. I do not need a good Hollywood cheese party, but I have to have more than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point of the film is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
