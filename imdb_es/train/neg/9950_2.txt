If the original idea of ​​the casting had been maintained (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Regrettably, racism had to enter the scene (literally) and mess up. The predominantly black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they swapped the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this movie. The focus of Ernest Dickerson's newsroom on 'directing' only verified that it was another affirmative action task. Master shot, up close, up close Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' even uses more creative work with the camera. Eric's rewriting of 'The most dangerous game' is at least an attempt to modernize the classic tale, but it does not give us any motivation as to why the characters are doing it. We are never given the reasons, apart from "nobody will miss these people", why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Apart from a sincere performance by John McGinley and a fair work by Charles Dutton, do not worry about this. A bit of curiosity, there was a real drunk driving accident during the shooting that wounded F. Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the young drunk driver that caused the accident.
