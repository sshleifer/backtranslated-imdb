John Goodman's show was pretty horrible, but this thing just sucks. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is desperate, written by someone who has confused memories of the rebellion of childhood, but who has never acquired any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everyone is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the show moves from an inexplicable and disconnected scene to another in such a useless way that it is not fun to watch. The worst part is that nobody in the production team seems to have seen snow!
