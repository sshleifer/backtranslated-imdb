Well, the cons first: the compulsory crocodile of the 70s (agree, correction, alligator) with immobile members is made worse for miniature underwater shots to scale (with the total length of the reptile compared to the size of the boat) using a toy alligator being swirls around the toy boat in brightly lit water, even for night shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of primitive Westerners, murderers, exploiters, the superstitious natives are going to hit **** and start massacring vacationers. Unjustified this time. Nobody really abused the natives, exploited, yes, but far from being abusive. After all, he was one of the natives (canoodling with a pampered supermodel during a moon full of taboo) that brought the curse of the river demon on them, right? <br /> <br /> Vacationers are easily annoyed (with the notable exception of the old-soul / mild blasphemous-little-girl-who-to-the-shine-to-the-heroes token that you often see in the Euroflicks of the 70), but far from deserving a violent death, unless they were your next door neighbors, look. A couple really dies being heroic, remarkable in that none of them fulfills the role of partner. There are only two consecutive villains in the whole movie, so deaths feel more arbitrary than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The sequence in which the giant alligator rustles down and assaults thirty tourists in less than five minutes will probably surprise you. hilarious. <br /> <br /> The point at which the natives decide not to erase the surviving westerners and practically say "hey, you're not so bad after all, excuse the racket from the night before" - because they exploded The monster lizard : it makes you shake your head while corny music is activated. You know, the local military dictatorship will end the town by hunting with the tourist trade after the credits begin ... <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. YOU ALL KNOW WHY you're interested in this movie in the first place, right? I thought so. If you are a Bach Completista, have the DVD reissued by the NoShame films earlier this year (digitally remastered without real extras, apart from the director who regrets the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not so bad, he is far from being an idiot (he is always a plus in the B movies) and the cynical boy provides most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look, but get it cheap!
