I saw this obvious feast on a shelf in a video store. And before I got my first VCR, I thought I'd baptize it with this little gem, and at its best to make movies it's excellent! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inadvertently funny. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicably at it. And like Christopher Walken he seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is about the bears of Quinn's country. <br /> <br /> Presents lines like "Shut up and let me FIGHT!". <br /> <br /> And "You're saying a lot of things, shit!" <br /> <br /> And the inestimable answer: "Unfortunately it's sh_it, hard angry sh_it!". <br /> <br /> You'll be surprised by the fight scene while Bo does a SOMMERSAULT on a pool table. ! And he makes a good kung fu kick when he gets out of the roll! Chop socky action and T and A thrill !!! <br /> <br /> What fan of schlock movies could you ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to torment Bo as a ghost, she asks him why he committed suicide instead of dealing with his debilitating illness. He says: "Real men do not eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo were a smart cookie, he would have called an exorcist right then and there!
