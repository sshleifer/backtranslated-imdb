The MST3K guys should see this dog from a movie. Basically, this is a silly hacker actor in Hollywood who can not get any acting gig. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So, what is this foolish actor doing? He dyes his blond hair and begins to act like an AA surfer, with the naive hope that this will allow him to act as an actor. You will laugh and you will see so many scenes without grace of this movie. Like when the actor's girlfriend breaks her heart and sobs and says phrases like, "How could you do this to me?" And why is he crying? Because he dyed his hair blond and became a surfer guy to get acting concerts. This movie does not make sense at all! The actor who played the governor in Benson is also in this and plays a stereotyped right-wing politician with a very funny dialogue. This movie will make you laugh, trust me. Are you talking to me?
