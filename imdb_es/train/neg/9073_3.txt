This movie seemed promising but in reality it was pretty bad. The premise was OK, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors did their best with limited material, but they could not overcome the petty spirit of this college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely irritating, even more so than at Rushmore, the rest of the cast had no problem. The scenes that should have been fun turned out to be unpleasant and incredibly youthful. It tries to be a road trip / American Pie, but fails miserably at all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
