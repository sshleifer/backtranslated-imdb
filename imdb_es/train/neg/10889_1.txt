The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I guess this is a horror comedy. I almost predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I think it could have the best effects of what I have in the house. I wish I had something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. I, after thinking about it a bit, have something good to say about this movie: it's over.
