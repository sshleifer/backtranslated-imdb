I am in favor of the idea of ​​a great epic of the American Revolutionary War. This is not like this. (And for that matter, neither was Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT, but I'm rambling). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in an advertising projection at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this costly piece of the period, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE), and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it was not like that. He longs for people to begin to writhe in their seats, whispering mocking comments about the awful accent of Pacino, who was supposed to be a man of the American frontier of Scottish descent (!), And Nastassja Kinski, who was supposed to have recently emigrated. England(!!). Then the story began and everything went downhill. <br /> <br /> The motivations were confused, the dialogue was atrocious, the events did not have a historical or political context. What there was of a plot wobbled forward in an absurd coincidence; to the second or third time that the supposed lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other, it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave a deranged performance as a British officer / pederast. His accent was all over the map, too. I guess there was no actor in English available. <br /> <br /> Many people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle the giggles, and then they laughed openly. I kept this: I thought that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to shoot them with handheld cameras, not even with Steadicam, the shaky one that gave a wrong "authenticity" newscast that ruined the meaning of the scale. <br /> <br /> There was a semi-famous television critic in the audience a few rows in front of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I realized that I was upset by the behavior of others. And of course, in his television segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'Escala Franklin from 1 to 10', while rudely commenting on the crazy people who had interrupted the screening the night before, clearly they did not. I do not know the art when they saw it. What a buffoon <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino did not star in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can not say I did not warn you.
