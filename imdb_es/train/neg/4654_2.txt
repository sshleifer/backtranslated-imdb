A vampire kills young women and paints with her blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker. After some murders, the assistant repents and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That its rhythm is too slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never such a strange sound) and atmosphere (new jazz here I come) and that the lights do not seem to be included in the set. It looks like a horror movie "author" with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can guess, it is the vampire who explains how to kill her, even if she does not. There is no need to do it; Of course, the crosses, the light, the garlic and the sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny movie. Maybe with some friends and lots of beers, it can not have its fun sides (to be honest, it's fun for 10 to 15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's one of the bad movies they present.
