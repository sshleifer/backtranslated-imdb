For a film so promising, it was disappointing, with a thin plot and acting between horrendous and incredible. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and is the worst cliche ending I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have torn my heart, to begin with, if the whole movie had been so painful. I was asleep! From the first scene, one was left wondering if the sister was trying to ask her twin for help, or she would just scare her to death, which would have been better for the audience and would have saved us from two hours of the worst performance. I have seen to date. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
