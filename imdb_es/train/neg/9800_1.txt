Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese siti television program that began in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese movies and action series, you would think I would love this show. <br /> <br /> You could not be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with the powerful Morphin rangers. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teenagers who obtain powers to become superheroes disguised as robotic dinosaurs that form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now, this premise is more preposterous and more ridiculous than any other Transformers movie, however, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> It was followed by two really bad, and I mean, really bad movies, and the actors that star in this series, completely disappeared from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you must choose, try to watch the Japanese series Zyuranger instead. <br /> <br /> Also, what about the horrible haircuts of the 90s and all the boys' earrings? It makes everyone look feminine!
