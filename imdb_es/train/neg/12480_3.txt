... Or, more precisely, it's so bad that you're going to have the best time of your life laughing at your ass when you see it! The 1983 "Deathstalker" by James Sbardellati is undoubtedly one of the most horrible productions that the subgenre Sword & Sorcery has brought, but it is very funny. The acting is terrible, the plot is pure shit, and the effects and photography could not be more fans. But it's the bad acting, the cheesy effects and the many mistakes that make this movie so much fun. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS NEXT - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch commends him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Obtaining the sword is quite easy, but the amulet and the chalice are held by Munkar. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a tournament in which the most skilled warriors of the county fight each other to death. The winner is then to take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, and therefore has planned to kill the winner (instead of not organizing the tournament in the first place). The Deathstalker is not only to obtain the three powers of creation, but also to save the beautiful daughter of the old and good king (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Fortunately, he does not get bored on his way to the tournament, as he is allowed to hunch the beautiful warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) meanwhile ... <br /> <br /> The movie has many, amazingly stupid and funny scenes . Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker decapitates a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls, however, is not that guy's head. The falling head has a red knob, while the man beheaded by the Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of the warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is seen for the first time in a black robe, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion, Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights against her, and during the sword fights his tunic (under which he is, of course topless) opens up, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head. of a pig. <br /> <br /> - The evil Munkar has an ugly creature and is locked in a chest. He feeds that little creature with eyeballs and human fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other scenes with no intention, fun, fun and great. The acting is terrible, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are very attractive, and although I described this movie as "involuntarily funny", I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how horrible the movie is. There is a good amount of blood and a lot of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the best time of their lives!
