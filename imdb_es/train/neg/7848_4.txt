This movie was just stupid, I do not think it scared me at all, I went in hoping to be shocked and scared, but mostly laughed. Some of the scenes were just fake and together. The blood scenes were extremely large and some of the mutants were ridiculously homosexual and they also stunk because the acting was just horrible. You think they could get some good actors and most of the characters that I hated simply because they acted stupid and stupid, even though they were supposed to be in the military. I watched movies for free and I saw many people go out guessing because I was so stupid, I'm glad I did not have to pay soon. THE DUMB ASS FILM I do not see it ... but again, that's my opinion
