Philip Film by K. Dickian. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the end of the twist and the cheese was too much for me. In the middle of the movie, I started to fear that kind of ending, and unfortunately he was right. But that does not mean that the movie is not worth your time. Not at all. The first half (as many have already commented here) is incredible. There are some parts where he begins to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that the art of the show is something very important in the future (we will do that kind of corny things because we can not) or is simply combining. But the paranoia is there and it feels "out of joint" too. Well one
