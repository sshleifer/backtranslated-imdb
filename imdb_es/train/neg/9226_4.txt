Okay, the movie festival crowd probably loved it. However, your average movie assistant, who eats popcorn and has raised the ten or fifteen dollars it costs to watch a movie these days, will probably wonder why he made this choice. If it is stamped "Copolla" is automatically a great thing, right? Incorrect! It is a clean parody of the pretensions of filmdom. But it is terribly "in". I worry that the filmmakers are more concerned about entertaining themselves than the audience. It's interesting like a movie film and has a giggle or two in it. But once you've taken your course in the movies and on television, the dust will grow on the film cans and the tape boxes that hold it. Hardly epoch or epic!
