I thought the movie was good in some places. The beginning was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The angles of the camera in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it because they did not completely cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie were not really that good of what we expect a lot in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> The dialogues did not make sense and I do not think they were very clever. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogues, but they failed miserably. It seemed as if many of the scenes between the actors were put in writing and did not make any sense for the story. <br /> <br /> The full movie presents only the law and the caine. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste At the moment, it's a good movie, but I do not think it's a waste.
