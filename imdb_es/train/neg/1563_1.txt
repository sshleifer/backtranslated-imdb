I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and I was surprised at how bad it was, although, according to the catalog description, I was excited to see it. Supposedly a "fake documentary" of two high school students who make a documentary of the life of the high school, presented bad performance, misdirection, lack of attractive characters as written, and everything is a total failure. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and, consciously, "great", although they are supposed to be outcasts. You have the general impression that a lot of people sitting making a badly intentionally bad movie to show their friends, but somehow came to Sundance. Baffling
