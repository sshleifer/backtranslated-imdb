I'm probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, on which this movie was based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this film has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, the character of Schwarzenegger is put on a game show. The main objective is to survive. But he is not in an arena. It has been unleashed in the city and has to escape the villains of the game program (I guess you would call them), which do not look anything like the characters in the movie. This premise built a lot of tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolute trash. I did not have any cinematic quality. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he was wrong with this one.
