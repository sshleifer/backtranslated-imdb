This thing is really horrible. There is no character with weight, everyone is floating in BG's. Motion capture is a good toy, but this movie shows that you really need people who know about animation to make an animated movie. THE MACHINE CAN NOT DO ANYTHING WELL BY ITSELF. If you see it as a strange movie, you'll have fun finding continuity errors ... ON A 3D MOVIE! It's fun to see how the princess dress moves like a thing with different physiques. You need animators and 3D animators, not data entries that know 3D programs. Observe the joints, like the elbows, how they lost volume and become deformed. The person who made the design of the character (very good) said that when he saw them move, "you can not say they come alive."
