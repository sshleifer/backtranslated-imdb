Although the film may have been "true" for Lewis' book (in the sense that the script was basically word for word, literally), it failed to capture any of the greatness that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, taps, ghouls, ghosts) are drawn and, as in the previous revision, the flight sequence on the green screen was very difficult to swallow. I almost laughed at death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their gigantic rigid suits and dollar teeth; I almost cried when I heard the "howl of the wolf", a man in a gray blur suit basically screaming as loud and as feminine as he could. <br /> <br /> All the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of the little Lucy Penvensie ... I could only feel so much indignation, despair, and teeth in the fourteen hours I spent watching the movie. The actress who plays the White Witch, in all her histrionics, seems to be more at home on stage, where a resounding voice, open arms and a brave effort in something Shakespeare would be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are performed indoors or outdoors. Inside, it's as if the BBC could only spend $ 100 on building a set, so it's very small, and all the characters are constantly stacked up. The castle of the White Witch is an English castle in ruins and in disrepair, full of styrofoam statues and poor lighting. When Penvensie's children are roaming the woods, in reality, any scene in the forest feels as if they are simply circling. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks good in the movie is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC probably ruined the entire budget of the film in the construction of the feline mechanic. It looks great when it's quiet and before it starts talking, but once it starts to move, you can not help but feel sorry for the poor man who has to be the butt in the lion suit. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you're a Narnia fan, you'll want to see this version, simply because it retains every word that Lewis wrote, but Lewis was not a screenwriter, and many of them the dialogue feels thick and clumsy when is on the screen During the scene in which the children are in the Beavers and prepare to flee from the wolves, the incessant Mrs. Beaver, "oh, just ONE more thing, dear ones, and then we will be ready to go", rated by the children. screams and simultaneous sighs and moans of "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!" - a scene of comic relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be FLEXING from an imminent danger, without asking whether to pack the sewing machine or not), detracts from the drama that the scene could have otherwise. In fact, the whole movie is sprinkled with the direction of false steps like these. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, with updated effects, a spectacular computer animation, a great synchronization around it, and a beautiful and white witch who steals the scene (who plays her role with all the subtle evil of an experienced politician, as opposed to a banshee who screamed) captures all of the grandeur and magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting from the original vision of Lewis (I think). Lucy is much prettier (NOT WHILE the teeth, YAY!), Like the beavers (and realistic), and the BBC Edmund has nothing in the divine, desperately hungry for acceptance, insecure and anguished with -un Edmund-Inferiority-Complex that the new version of Disney faces. <br /> <br /> Unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time making fun of popular movies, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
