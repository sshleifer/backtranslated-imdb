Oh dear ... like English, and a small part of Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ... to this day, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I am a nobody, that I expected something better. So my comments are like 'straw in the wind'. But, that's the point, right? - I have no ax to analyze the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the great unwashed, I will watch a movie to be transported to another place. Yes, suspend the belief for a brief period. But not to enter a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If it had been for an unknown author and director, I suppose that this 'production' would have been punished to oblivion. Unfortunately, it is not, and I kept my eyes open and confused. Having seen some of the favorable reviews of this work, I worry a little ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is that, without prejudice, I try to see each film on its own merits. Regardless of the author, the director, the studio or even the notoriety of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: Do not write and direct the same production. It is full of danger. Movies should be moderate to maintain an appearance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports "I could and could do better ..."
