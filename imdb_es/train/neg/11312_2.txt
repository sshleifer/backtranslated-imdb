This movie deserves credit for its original focus. It combines elements of theater, cinema and epic narratives. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The biggest weakness of the films is that they are not willing to commit to anything; It has pitched, moralistic and epic elements without committing to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is turning in his grave before this horrible adaptation that makes Percival, who is adorable and unbearable, in a more disheveled and rude churl. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that two types of people will see it. this, Francophiles or Arthurophiles. Speaking as one of the last, I found that the movie could not be seen and that it is a disrespectful and disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
