The disappointing musical version of "Anna and the King of Siam" by Margaret Landon, filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has Deborah Kerr as a widowed teacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept work as a tutor. the king's many sons, and perhaps teach the Real One one or two things in the process! The theatrical image starts well, but loses energy and focus quickly. Yul Brynner, repeating his triumph on stage as the King, is a dominant presence, but is used, according to invented history, as a buffoon. Kerr maintains her cold dignity and fares better, despite having to synchronize with the voice of Marni Nixon. Perhaps having already played this role until death, Brynner seems to have nothing left for the translation of the screen, except the bombing. In the second half, with Anna and the moppets on stage a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is pretty ridiculous, and the songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein are mostly heavy. Brynner won an Oscar for Best Actor, but it is the wrestler Kerr who keeps this trinket over the water. Too long, heavy and "old fashioned" in the worst sense of the term. ** since ****
