I do not see how this person who even likes Van Damne might like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with some promise. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. The action scenes with the family pavilion trying to save the twins is a great start and is a good guide to the main story. However, the movie is downhill from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director had stayed with the original premise. That is to say, the brothers are born in different parts of the world and, therefore, they learn different skills. A brother is supposed to be an expert in martial arts, but the other brother is supposed to be an expert in firearms. How convenient when the time comes for the brother who has never raised a gun before suddenly to be a great shooter, and the brother who has not been taught martial arts is suddenly making divisions and high kicks. br /> <br /> The plot, the action, etc. They are just ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne confronts a soldier armed with an AK-47? The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and shooting Van Damne, he is making a battle cry as if he were wielding a battle ax and running towards him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him ... while still at a distance of between 75 and 80 yards. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing finishes. Bolo Yeung is an expert martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne as Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that had so much promise. If you are a fan of Van Damne, save time and see Hard Target or one of his previous films.
