I go to the cinema to entertain myself. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this movie. From beginning to end, there is no respite from the gray and bleak reality of this woman's life. It is a rhythm, without change of mood. I stayed until the end just because I was convinced that things should improve. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many moans that resonate around the cinema as the film approached an end. Representing honestly the social depravity is not a crime, but bore your audience to complain is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. A terrible movie.
