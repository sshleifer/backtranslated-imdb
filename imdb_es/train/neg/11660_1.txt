Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear you have no real knowledge on how to make movies. He has made a brilliant movie and that is a scary movie. The scary movie 2 was also good, but all Keenan has done are real disasters. Avoid such titles as not being a threat to South Central while you drink your juice in the hood ... I know, what a title! obviously this movie too, anything that has the name of Keenans in the credits. <br /> <br /> it was an hour and a half of nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me, maybe women like this film a little because of some of the things that happen, but in general this movie will never like anyone with good taste in movies ........ 1 / 10 ....... Seaton jd
