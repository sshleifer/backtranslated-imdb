This movie is horrible. I have not laughed so much about a movie that was involuntarily funny in a long time. Leno should have gotten stuck in order to stop and on the evening television. The cars in the movie were great, but the movie itself is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It's pathetic, the acting is horrible, and the plot could have been written by a 4-year-old boy. Do not get me wrong, jay leno is very funny, but not in this movie!
