TOM BROWN SCHOOLS <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: stereo <br /> <br /> In England at the end of the 19th century, the Young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school of Rugby where he undergoes the reforms of a new radical director (Stephen Fry) and faces the resident bully of the school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations, especially the top version by Gordon Parry in 1951, Thomas Hughes's ever-green novel receives the treatment of the early 21st century, courtesy of the screenwriter Ashley Pharoah ("Where the Heart Is", from television) and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It's nice enough and visible enough, but it's also quite serious and boring, which is distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new director determined to sweep away some of the most dubious "traditions" of the school, and by introducing a possible new star in 14 Pettyfer, one year old, a talented guy with the kind of effortless charm and a vivid appearance that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is the typical fodder of the UK television, the kind of thing that executives are eager to fill the schedules with the product of "prestige", even one as unremarkable as this. The publication of the United Kingdom, "Radio Times", described it as "delicately strange" and raised an eyebrow of concern for "all that racket and brutality and a handsome and discourteous villain who tortures the lives of young boys." Quite.
