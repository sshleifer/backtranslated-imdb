Maiden Voyage is just that. I would like to say immediately that I saw 5 minutes of this before I could not take it anymore. As already said in another comment, this movie does not fall into the thing "so bad that it's good", it's just bad. The acting is horrible, the sfx are poor, and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras suck, the "Ranger Rangers" and the others seem to hold their guns like water pistols. <br /> <br /> Do not bother watching this movie, the only special thing is that, no matter how low your expectations, you will still be disappointed.
