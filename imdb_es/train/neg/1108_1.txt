A little sad and without a sense of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Wrong written, with inane and wooden dialogue. You do not care if the characters (in fact, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point for everything. Maybe some of the sets and the surroundings will be interesting: the spaces between the tables of all the buildings can be faithful to the way in which life was lived. The meeting of the frame is unnecessary and distracting, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy is both boring and inept.
