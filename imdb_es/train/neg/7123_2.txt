Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This tale of terror finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and a wife (Peggy Weber) tormented by the memory of his former wife and skulls screaming throughout his empty mansion and lily pond. Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious girlfriend crazy? Or is it the gardener with learning problems Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has taken care of the grounds of the mansion since the death of the original owner of the house? This low budget horror movie has a story that keeps you involved in the whole ending. The special effects are pretty bad even in the 1958 standards. I swear sometimes the screaming skull sounds like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is the character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can catch this as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
