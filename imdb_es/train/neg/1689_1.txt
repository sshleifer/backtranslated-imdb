Wow, what a total disappointment! The fact that people think that this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct scam of "The Ring". The history? Was there one? Not in my opinion ... Just a lot of flashy images. The whole movie was a boring, stupid mess. I suppose there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And that girl, Buffy? Well, she is a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and so talented ... No, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I guess a lot of kids helped this movie at the box office, since it was PG-13, and if it had been classified as R, I would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!
