I was not as "lucky" as some of the others who commented on this movie: I've never seen anything else outside of ... let's say ... the "fertile" mind of Sarno. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time in topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank a bit (?) ... she was so homely, she was cute! The performance was quite obsolete, too, although the delivery of lines in a second language could have explained much of that problem. Trying to follow the plot was an important task: was there really one? I totally agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want GOOD bloodsucker movies, check out the Hammer classics like "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Brides of Dracula." <br /> <br /> The most humorous part (involuntarily) is where the doctor removes her clothes with a cloud of bats ... that you never SEE! Cable here in the Great White North but, for God's sake, do not rent it!
