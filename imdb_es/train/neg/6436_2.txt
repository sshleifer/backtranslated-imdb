I am a kind person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was very little plot and the deeper and more interesting areas that were touched, that is, what Jesus really wanted us to know, were overlooked and, instead, gave us visual doses of sadistic punishments inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more human for both his character and the audience. The performance was hardly there and the direction was not inspired. And, if I saw a little more water or a pigeon flying towards the camera, I may have started screaming louder than Patricia.
