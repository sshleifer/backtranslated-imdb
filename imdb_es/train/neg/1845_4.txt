Losing Control is another offer in the genre of erotic thriller that could be considered as the fiction of the pulp of the world of cinema. Generally, they imply an indirect route towards a murderous intent, interspersed with abundant undress. This is not a complaint, especially when the incredibly beautiful women invariably inhabit this fantasy world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering a writers block attack. Just by chance, (or do you?) Meet a man (Doug Jeffery) who gets involved with her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to divulge any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to stop the matter. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) believes that he will do wonders with his book sales. As in most movies of this type, the ending is nearing the end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of film to think, there are no changes, then, but I like them. They are so undemanding. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast vary. Doug Jeffery takes the film as the psychopath / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince the woman in danger. Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, a warning note about the DVD that is being reviewed. Both the lid and the disc have an R rating and an operating time of 93 minutes, but the execution time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes are truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is interrupted just as it is beginning. 4 stars.
