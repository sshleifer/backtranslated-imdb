Kurosawa really ruined him in this. Every genius is allowed a failure. The concept is fine, but the execution is very blurry. <br /> <br /> This movie has an air of fantasy that turns it into an art film. The poor affected by Tokyo deserve a more just and realistic portrait. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
