I still have to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I've wanted to do for quite some time. I'm sure it has to be more scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I saw him the other day, although I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I saw it on DVD, but I'm sure that in the theater it must have been an incredible sight. After the first special effects were finished, I was waiting for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I realized that this movie at least has to be based loosely on the classic novel, so there should be a good story. , but it was not relegated to look at the magnificent character of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film basically because there was not much more to see. Lili Talor was a very bad character. I did not like a little of her, something about complaining people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and his face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job of trying to get over this movie with some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> Half to three quarters of the way I was dying to go see a countryside on Friday the 13th or a Scream queenish film! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is not a story there, at least they fill it with bloody deaths or attractive females. This did not have anything. <br /> <br />
