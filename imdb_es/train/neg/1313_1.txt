Do not bother trying to see this terrible mini series. It's a six-hour diameter, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry with each other. There is no heat in this story, there is no true passion, there is no true romance. It is a dry, boring, extensive and uninspired place as they come. And it does not even meet the expected level of technical competence. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
