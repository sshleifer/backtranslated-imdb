I'm horrified by how bad this movie is. As pastiche of Hollywood artists of the early twentieth century, set a new low level, even beyond The Moderns or (panting) Cradle Will Rock and I never thought I would see a movie worse than those 2. It is true that it was a slightly different environment. period. However, the intentions and results were terribly similar. <br /> <br /> First is the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even try to capture the appearance or sound of the period they supposedly represent. <br /> <br /> Well, Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this is a mess And the rest of the Bogdonovitch photos have not been much better. I guess rubbing against Welles & Hitch & Ford was worn out a long time ago. However, it is still good to host TCM.
