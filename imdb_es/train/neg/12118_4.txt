In 1972, after his wife went his own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a beautiful queen of sculptural beauty, with long, adorable and beautiful hair, is planned to fill a gap in Elvis' life. When Elvis' divorce became final, Linda was already at her post as the legendary interpreter's girlfriend and travel companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a striking look at their love relationship and their company. Linda wholeheartedly attending to the needs and desires of her lover. And even hold your medicine to swallow for a handful and present your own love story with Valium. Sometimes this movie is hard and dark at heart; A very unattractive look to the 'King' and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely horrible like Elvis. On acting up the hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks Linda's elegance, but she does the job quite well. The cast includes: John Crawford, Lee Route and Rick Lenz. Seeing this twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this revision prevent you from checking it. For most Elvis fans with whom I have consulted, this is not a favorite presentation.
