I was very upset with this movement. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was not very humorous, the action was exaggerated, the songs without melody. Even the plot was weightless. From a writer who has written successful scripts such as Guru and Dhoom, he had many expectations. The actors worked too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Kareena shook the screen in a bikini but for two seconds. I think doubles directors should investigate how action movies are made. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because that is your signature piece. But, the signature of the Hindi cinema are the songs. A good action movie should not last more than two hours and it may not seem unrealistic. But, in the future, I am sure that these action films will be much sharper. It should also be kept in mind: Comedy and action films do not mix unless done correctly. Good luck next time.
