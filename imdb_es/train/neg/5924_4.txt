Diana Muldaur appears in Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. Nobody on board seems to notice, maybe it was the hair. In any case, this time is not the receptacle of a god (see previous episode), but is a very famous lady with magical powers that allow you to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man who is most in love with her has few cards less than a full deck and tries to kill Medusan's ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small box, this is a bad way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr is not hurt so well herself. What happens next is a bit silly and when the episode ended the first time I saw it, I felt quite relieved. Seeing all the men on board leaving gala for Muldaur was pretty silly and Spock's performance when he went crazy for a short time was pretty cheesy. Do yourself a favor: if you have not seen the program before, choose a different episode.
