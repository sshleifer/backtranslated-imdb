This is available in a "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films, and as I just finished "Barracuda", I saw it too. This is a movie that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young ladies who roam the streets of some foreign town, but where are they exactly? They stop to look at the necklaces of some Chinese vendor and try on Chinese-style clothes in a store, but then we see Aztec dancers? And all the time, these girls are being followed by two men, who eventually give up all the stealth that they did not have to chase the girls in a wild race through the city, and finally they catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin in a rope around her neck, and these guys want to find the booty, and where did she get it? Then, in flashback, we come back to find out. And how did they know that she had this coin? It's hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, in the past, when these two women were 10 years old, they went out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends in a boat, and then stopped to take a breath. in their tanks, drag this young man to the dock of his house, only to have his grandfather come out and invite the "young man" to tea with his grandmother. But not everyone has the tea, Todd has returned to the boat to see how the girls are and, when they are away, the boat explodes and when they return to the house, his friends have mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems that these "kind people" grow their own vegetables but they expect the meat to go through a spell and they serve her herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd left. Island, but now, they're coming back, escorted by their captors, and they're there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where they were BEFORE. It also seems that there is someone else on the island, and the thugs begin to die mysteriously, one by one, and since there are only three, it does not take long. And there is even a kind of happy ending, which will leave the viewer as baffled as it was during the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined without any acting skills, they're hilarious. The Hillbilly-type family also lacks the ability to act, even though the grandfather is Hank Worden, who appeared in many movies and television shows. The action is confusing, the places are even more confusing and the island looks like southern California. <br /> <br /> So, what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it's certainly worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.
