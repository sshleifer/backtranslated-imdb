Well, I found out about this movie and saw that the preview read almost all the reviews and I was having a hard time discussing whether I should watch it or not. Before I even saw the movie, I was emotionally weird in it. I was so insecure if I was going to see this and be bothered for a long time. So I chose to take a risk, I saw it and here is what I thought: the beginning started well for me. It seemed to be heading in a decent direction. I went through the rape scene and I could not understand why people were so upset or bored by the movie. Do not get me wrong, the scene of the rape was just as sad and terrifying, but it did not really bother me at a dramatic point. Then, when half came, I understood the boring things that were happening. There were about 5 minutes of shots of nothing more than people walking around without saying anything! One thing is to have a picture in which a person is showing some kind of emotion, but this movie did not have that. I had about 3 of these nonsensical scenes, where you see the main character that Maya gets out of control but did not show it well, which made me want to move quickly. Then, when he got involved in the hardcore party, it was not so boring but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson still did a great job. Okay, after an hour of uselessness in the middle, revenge attracts Maya's attention. That's where it got unsettling. I did not feel bad for him or nothing got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt very happy after that. I really can not tell you whether or not to see this movie because it is so ... I do not know, I can not find a word to summarize it. But if you choose to see it, do not be without supervision.
