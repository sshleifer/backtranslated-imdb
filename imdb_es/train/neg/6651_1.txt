This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First, I will say that the performance was very good, and for the entire cast. <br /> <br /> This was apparently, it was supposed to be very unconventional, and in that sense it succeeded. In the same way, the story revolves around an egocentric self-seeking, who is a chronic, untalented liar, whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> This was worse than watching a car accident.
