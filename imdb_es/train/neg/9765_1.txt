I do not cast "a few" often, but if there was ever a movie that deserved this kind of attention, it's "Gas!" This is a self-indulgent garbage that reaches part of the environment of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat on the attempt. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman was looking for: Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce the immortal role of Gould in the original film version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar argument (in the movie "Whiffs": look it up here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approached the brass ring with "Whiffs" that Corman with "Gas!" but I did not arrive at all. None of those films approached the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gas!" That is not Nobody comes close to acting really at a level above the high school theater. Production values ​​stink. Someone else here mentioned the magic headlights that regenerate in an escape car, and there is more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as is supposed in this movie, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" Actually put me to sleep. It is not a safe cure for insomnia, but it is really close. On the cinematic sleep induction scale, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (which in turn was notable for being more boring than Mosfilm's original, even though the studio does not seem familiar with the idea of ​​keeping the attention of the public through a judicious edition). br /> <br /> The judicious edition would have decimated "Gas!" About twenty minutes. The result would be useless, but no more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Certain movies are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even funny bad.
