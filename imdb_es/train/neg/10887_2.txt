...... this movie is pretty horrible, the only thing that prevents me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that, unfortunately, I have seen worse things. <br /> <br /> The music of the jungle, the demons that stand out, and the blood / teeth / eyes fluorescent UV style give it that "horrible" aspect, and the script is serious ... this movie is more like a test to see how long it can last before surrendering. It is also predictable but not in a good way. Nothing that this movie does is good. I saw him 10 minutes ago and I thought he was going to rant a little, so there you are. (Oh, and the performance does not disappoint the movie, it's also terrible)
