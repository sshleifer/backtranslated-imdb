A terrible performance, a boring plot, a stupid story and only a terrible movie summarizes this piece of scrap metal. It was unbearable to sit through. Simply unpleasant Do not waste a penny on this. Movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie on for people to see. This "horror" movie was not even in the least frightening, creepy or disturbing. In no way was it visually appealing. The acting was so terrible for all the actors that any attempt to attract him to the film through dialogue is completely destroyed at the moment when the actor / actress opens his mouth. In addition to the full story, I do not know why someone would make a movie with this story AGAIN. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste a moment watching this movie. You will feel more foolish to see it.
