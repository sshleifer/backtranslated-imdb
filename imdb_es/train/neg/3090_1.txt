I really do not have anything new to add, but I felt I had to comment on this sack. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I go back to review my MST3K DVD collection and I just saw the Hobgoblins for the tenth time. It's very, very painful, but it was the next one on the list ... You can see that there is a small core of a real movie buried under all the garbage that is "Hobgoblins" but it just could not get out. Everything about this movie is 4th. The history, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the ... ahhhh, forget it. I can see a piece of shit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (also known as "Zaat") over and over again with almost no adverse effect (I like it in fact, by the way, will be at TCM later this month) October 2009) but "Hobgoblins" is a complete ball game. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that now it's about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications and yet the music of dance "New Wave" by ersatz to which Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman were playing in the living room, STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This torment will last days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, right?
