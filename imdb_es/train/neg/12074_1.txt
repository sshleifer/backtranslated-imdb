Ridiculous horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to divide equally. One condition: they must spend a week on their farm to get the money. And if one of them dies, the others get more. Guess what happens next ... <br /> <br /> I saw a new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. That's all the good that I can say about it. <br /> <br /> List only some of the problems this movie has: the killer is most obvious; The servants are called Igor and Elga - come on! part of the sound recording was so bad that I could not distinguish the dialogue (no big loss, I'm sure); the blood was scarce and very badly made; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains a truly abominable performance, so bad that you just look at the screen in disbelief. Even the professional Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only pretty good performance was that of trouper Faith Domergue (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and frail here). However, I have to admit: the final line of this movie is a gem! <br /> <br /> Why was the name "Legacy of Blood" changed? There's another 1978 horror movie with that name! <br /> <br /> Whatever it's called, it's a bad movie. It must be avoided at all costs.
