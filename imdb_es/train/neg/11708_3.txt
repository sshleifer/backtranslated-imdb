I'm surprised how this movie was made. I saw him working at home writing emails and answering the phone. I ONLY saw it because I expected the "revenge" part to be good. Needless to say, the revenge and forced turns of the plot were not worth the emails during which they were observed. in fact, I'm not sure what happened in the end. the acting was as bad as the recreation scenarios in the "FBI Files" program; by far, the worst recreations (in fact only "Arrest and judgment" can possibly be so bad in recreations). I did not even know that the protagonist was in Third Eye Blind until I saw the movie here in IMDb, but it's obvious why he has not made any movie since then. I hope he is a good singer.
