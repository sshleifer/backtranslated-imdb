I'm not sure if users should be allowed to review movies after just sitting in the middle, but I'm afraid I could not take a minute longer. <br /> <br /> If this abject excuse for a movie does not do it I do not have the grand GP at the end spinning like a wheel in his grave, so I doubt that something will happen. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above 'It's not a movie for Parsons fans' sums up most of my feelings. How dare a director and writer (of the second category) try something they are clearly incapable of delivering? What were you thinking? Where to start? <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPTURE: I thought I was going to have a slice of bittersweet Americana. What I got was a poorly executed slapstick, without clich√© that has not been unleashed. Stupid hippy? Check. Stupid fat cop? Check. Terrible plot plans? Check. Female characters embarrassingly written? Double verification. Total disregard for the story you are trying to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you are seeing is a soap and not a very well written one. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with the ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville that has not moved much. Scene with ex girlfriend that was a bit like the last one. And so on ... <br /> <br /> THE ADDRESS: After some consideration, my friends and I decided that seeing this was like watching a bad Quincy episode, or maybe a particularly poor Dukes of Hazzard. That's how bad the address was. Terrible jump cuts, horrible camera work, insults, ins and outs and scenes. God, he was worthy of admiration. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman whose most notable recent work is a really lousy Sunday night drama called the Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the television with the lowest denominator). And then everything made sense ... <br /> <br /> THE PERFORMANCE: Are we now so critical that when someone randomly decides to try the show, if it is not so bad, it sucks, we applaud their efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to cross each scene. Poor Christina A. does not have such luck. His performance is an automobile accident (although I do not know what you do with those lines). The 'hippy' in the hearse: oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Have not we moved on from Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you understand what I say. What I would say is that, as mentioned in other reviews, nobody in this film cares much about the solo work of The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram. They did not know anything about the American road movie and they certainly do not give a damn about trying to do something with a certainly decent history of rock mythology. This film was superficial, it could not explore anything and it was amazingly carefree from the beginning until ... oh, wait, I did not reach the end. And I suggest you stay away too.
