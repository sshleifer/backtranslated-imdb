Revolution is a terrible movie, I do not care if you're a history teacher, news editor, Al Pacino fan, there's no way this film can win a legitimate '10'. <br /> <br /> The key The point to the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) trying to get money from a note he received for the radical patriots who take his ship. Everything revolves around that note. Tom's son joins the army to compensate for the note, making Tom also join the army, they go on an adventure to try to leave the army, years later, the war is over and they can finally deliver the note for their ship. . The End. <br /> <br /> I had some battle scenes, and at best they were pretty mediocre. The transitions between scenes were used "five months later" and magically placed the characters in some famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the movie in general is hard to follow. So save your "Notes" and look at the Patriot instead.
