Dark Rising is your typical bad horror / science fiction / fantasy movie, obviously produced quickly. It has a strange and inexplicable plot with holes so big that an elephant could pass through them. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on but it really did not matter, it was a simple demon hunter coming back from the dimension of hell to save the campers' story with confusing things added about witches and a book of evil with Trace Elements and characters that have no meaning or disappear completely without reason. The acting is bad but, honestly, there's not much you can do with this script, I suppose. There are a couple of topless scenes, which is probably the only reason why this bad movie was made (like so many other bad films). Give this a pass unless there is nothing else on television.
