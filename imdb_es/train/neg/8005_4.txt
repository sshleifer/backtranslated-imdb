Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han River, a mutated beast is thrown into turmoil. The beast snatches the youngest member of the Park family, and the rest of his family can find it before it becomes the last food of the beast. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: mutated bears, large alligators, herds of voracious komodo dragons, the whole lot. The characteristics of the creature are my favorite type of horror movie. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it was not like that. <br /> <br /> There were three main problems: <br /> <br /> The first one can be seen with a quick glance at your IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Science-Fiction / Suspense <br /> <br /> Too many goddamned genres. He took himself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet he was too cheerful to have a real message (although he seemed to be trying to make some sort of statement: anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama got lost and mixed in a confused mix with all the other styles. <br /> <br /> Second, after the monster's initial attack, nothing happens in almost the entire movie. The central family wanders in search of their own, while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's it, they just wander, occasionally hitting each other, presumably for a bit of relief from the comedy. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently did the same with the director, since the threads of the plot are not resolved (a mysterious plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten, and never resolved). <br /> <br /> And finally, the movie is awkwardly political. He thinks Americans are stupid and evil, but he does not give us American characters with more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American moment against the Korean sage. With an assistant at the Korean morgue asking his chief, the coroner, not to pour chemical products into the Han River. The American coroner almost laughs maniacally while ordering the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, it's a lazy movie and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the monster is good, a kind of mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite interesting, and the initial monster chase through the park is very fun. There are also some good photos in the movie. Some of which remind me, strangely, the way Firefly was filmed (shaky cameras, out of focus shots, etc.). There is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a small child who has saved are sitting in the family home. mobile food stand. It's night and snow falls, the streetlight is emitting a cold light, but the food stand has a warm glow. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie disappointed me a lot. I had been waiting for a decent creature movie, and instead I got a bit of pseudo-politics, horror comedy. As for the comments on IMDb, I can not help thinking that if it had been a production from the United States, it would have been programmed. The fact that it is a foreign film does not mean it is good. In recent years there have been some great films outside Korea (the trilogy of revenge and the Brotherhood, for example), but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once I am in favor of a remake. Tighten the direction, improve the scripts and this could have been a good movie. As it is, it's not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.
