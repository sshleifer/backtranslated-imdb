This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to present himself as the just and perfect prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense's advice or attempted to challenge the audience with a really meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could get carried away by such a terrible path. <br /> <br /> Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazis' point of view, but THIS WAS THE POINT of the Nuremberg Trails! Four hours of simply attacking the Nazis ... come on! It has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really believe that Alec Baldwin should remain Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the 1959 film, Trail at Nuremberg. . That movie is very superior.
