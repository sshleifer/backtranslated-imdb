I saw this movie because Amber Benson is cool and Nick Stahl in general is pretty good. I thought that any movie that shows two actors that I like and respect can not be so bad. And in that sense, he was right: considering the critical dialogue that was given to them, they both perform reasonably well. Not enough for the movie to stop sucking, you understand, but enough to be able to overcome the 75 minutes of the movie (and that's the main signal of a horrible movie: when, at 40 minutes, we prayed that It finishes). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know where to start with the problems in "Taboo". The dialogue, as mentioned, is frightening; Wooden and completely unnatural. January Jones' performance is incredibly bad, and since she is the character we spend most of the time following the house, this is an unforgivable defect. The plot manages to be so complicated that it makes no sense and, at the same time, be so clich√© as to be completely predictable (literally, none of the big 'twists' in this movie would surprise anyone but a small child). Leaving aside some interesting shots, the director tries too hard with very little success, the uncomfortable tracking shots and the shaking of the camera distract attention from the small element of the story. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars in this movie are awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last one is presented by the fact that one of the jokes made me laugh a little. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
