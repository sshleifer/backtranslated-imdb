Well, what can you say about an adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some incredible actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they are clearly accumulating the money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics: Anthony with Hugh Grant (who seems embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a "the" Cartland adaptation, Bonham Carter is the one ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title!). Gilbert is the weak link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and, of course, he can act, and the rest of the cast does it with his tongue firmly on his cheek (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg)
