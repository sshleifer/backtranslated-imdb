I remember seeing this movie in 86 'when it first came out and what a horrible movie. The performance was atrocious, the plot was so fragile that it would have done or should have flown in a breath of wind. I think he made me sleep more than once and I was not tired of what I remember. Please, avoid at all costs, better still, remove your teeth without anesthesia because it would be more entertaining. It is a pity that I could not give you a zero or negative score. I wish I had not wasted my money getting this one from the video store, all I can say is that the tape on which it was was still new and almost not surprising, since the movie was very poor. If I remember correctly, I sat down and I saw him with a girl I really wanted to go out with and the fact that he was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake, that's how bad this movie was.
