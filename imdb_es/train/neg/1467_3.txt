No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the revolutionary biography of Hitler, who was originally the scientific advisor of this television movie, was separated from it. The film is historically too incorrect. The errors begin immediately when Hitler's father, Alois, dies at home, while in reality he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moved from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. He could continue on and on. Hitler's childhood and youth are too short, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important people from the early days of the party, such as Hitler's fatherly friend, Dietrich Eckart or the party's "philosopher", Alfred Rosenberg, are totally missing. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is presented as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl's own gloss on the vision of himself that he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about his "FÃ¼hrer". But the biggest problem with the film is the representation of Hitler himself. It is characterized by being someone who is not constantly friendly, has no charisma or charm and constantly orders everyone around him. After watching the movie, one wonders, how such a disgusting person was able to get followers. As we all know, what was an evil criminal of Hitler, naturally, every screenwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic. But the truth is that in private it could be quite charming and entertaining. His companions did not follow him because he was constantly yelling at them, but because they liked this strange man. Beyond all those historical errors, the film is well made, the actors are first class, the location shots and the production design give a credible impression of the time.
