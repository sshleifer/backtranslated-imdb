What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available and the talent gathered. It is not the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to believe in the audience the voluntary suspension of disbelief. The POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, absorbs us, but in the future Mr. Burton forgets that his viewers have a functional brain. The exaggerated libertarianism of Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the futility of blocking humans, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of primitive humans who suddenly ride at full speed), the massive and immediate human rebellion, they are all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never projects a sense of real fear, danger or change in this world upside down. Compared to the original, in which the nakedness of Chuck Heston metaphorically captured his total helplessness and astonishment at the turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg retains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an intrinsically extravagant situation, and we never ask ourselves about his well-being. Unlike Heston, it seems that he is never really in danger. Tim Burton should have used part of the f / x budget for some competent writers. In fact, after this lower fiasco, I wonder why the Hollywood producers ever bothered to solve the screenwriters and directors to make threats. Let them walk. The trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet the repetitions of this effort will be non-existent. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another missed opportunity.
