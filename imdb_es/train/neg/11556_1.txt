Oh, those Italians! Assuming that films about aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles drowned in a Gothic atmosphere and relatives trying to seize an inheritance are intrinsically interesting for everyone! If you've seen a movie like this, you've basically seen them all (the favorite "Screaming Skull" of MST3K also fits in the mold) ... and "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" is a formula, for -The numbers, and bored as hell. Even the delicious Erika Blanc is wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
