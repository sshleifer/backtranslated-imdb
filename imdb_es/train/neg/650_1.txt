Why Hollywood feels the need to remake the films that were so brilliant at their best (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes) but it is considerably worse why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror movies that were not brilliant to start (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Like their originals, these remakes fail to create atmosphere, character or any genuine fear. The graduation night is so flat and uninteresting that it is hard to see, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a misplaced tour, massively uninteresting and, ultimately, boring that fails in everything it is designed to do. It is clear that Hollywood Horror is dead. Even people like The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. The graduation night is practically bloodless and I will not even mention how bad the plot is. His inability to seal the identity of the murderers makes this the horror movie with less suspense since erm ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious slasher movies of the 1980s returns to terrorize moviegoers with this remake that only proves how dreadful high school dances can be! Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now it's time to leave the past behind and celebrate her prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends get ready to enjoy their last big buzz in high school living and celebrating until dawn. But while Donna is willing to look beyond her nightmares and toward a brighter future, the man she thought had escaped forever returned for a final dance. An obsessive assassin is on the loose, and will kill anyone who tries to prevent him from reaching his only and only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the day of graduation, and what will Donna do when she is forced to face her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis co-star in the Slasher remake that will have teenagers in tuxedo clothes everywhere looking nervously over their shoulders as they head out onto the dance floor. A plot that probably discourages you by going to see this. The witch if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much to work with, McCormick tries to relieve the stress of the most banal situations. At one point, a girl stands back in a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to make her jump in a moment of fear and jump. Desperate times really require desperate measures. There have not been so many pictures of cabinets since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is likely to be a frightening and terrifying movie to be extracted from the commodification of glamor and the creepy obsession of society with the youthful beauty. This is not that movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody is going to like the night of graduation, it is even a disappointment for those who, in general, enjoy the remakes of the hacking work. Considering his absolute lack of blood or startle. One night you will be in a hurry to forget.
