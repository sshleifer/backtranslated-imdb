"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the ingenious "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The film Lampoon is unrolled in three separate vignettes and not connected, each with different interpreters. The only common thread is the total lack of redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there's one. Another critic of this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry show their assets beautifully, in the first and second part, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, unfortunately, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround it, and there is nothing in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most unpleasant of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the summary of this film. Benson plays a young policeman eager for beavers, happily reporting on his first day of service, ready to rid the streets of evil. They combine it with an old and cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners take their first patrol together, we perceive a possible redemption of the previous failures of the film. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical veteran will be reformed by the faithful sense of duty and loyalty of his new partner. Maybe everything will end happily after all. But, alas, this film goes directly to the bathroom, without redemption, without a happy ending, without a coherent story of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies", I thought I had seen The worst mess Hollywood could become. Unfortunately, I had not seen half of it. <br /> <br />
