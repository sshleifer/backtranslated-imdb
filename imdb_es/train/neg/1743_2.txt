Contrary to its title, this film does not offer spices and, therefore, the audience is subject to a dish without flavor. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, onstage, reminiscent of Pakistani works available on video, including mannerisms. Everyone is screaming, screaming and doing weird things for no reason. The premise seems interesting, since it is a direct impulse from Hollywood's "Boeing Boeing." John Abraham, which is so natural in almost all his films, is a complete disagreement here, if we keep the moral factor aside, even strangers events seem hackneyed, Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced enthusiasts, try hard to lift the film for being natural but in vain.At least, the characters of three girls must contrast to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately here also appear those without Bimbettes buxomed (3B) that speak, behave and even scream in a similar way: The biggest hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls in her same house pretending that they will never know each other To do some sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways, therefore, so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something that the audience digest easily. But, undoubtedly, the great meat show and the tempting promotions always give uch movies a great initial. Now, for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such cinema audience is surely corrupted and demented insofar as they connect with a sadistic, strange and maddening kind of humor, where they are not the characters of those who laugh but rather of themselves and of theirs. The frustrations that seem insensible we have become that to laugh we have to support such things?
