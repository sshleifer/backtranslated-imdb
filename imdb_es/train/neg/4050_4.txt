That is a rather old-fashioned film that aims to show the desire for freedom of young people in a British school dehumanizing.

Yes, young people dream of something else, but they break their dreams and sweep away their optimism at the threshold of life. Cool. <br /> <br /> Basically, that's how good intentions could be summed up in Si ... Good intentions that do not provoke cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory film. Do you see how boring I want to say? <br /> <br /> At least that old man helped Kubrick choose McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentality.
