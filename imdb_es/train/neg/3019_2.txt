How can you take seriously your history of hunting, hard and glamorous, with that accent? It is absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the manager is nauseating and truculent, the plot is a shallow, boring and confused remash of gangsters, and the acting is not convincing. The film features new characters throughout the film and is told in a fragmented flashback, mostly out of sequence, apparently just to keep you pleasant and confused. The film always shows you THINGS THAT DO NOT HAPPEN REALLY and then says "that did not really happen, this happened": observe the (apparent) murder of the "first ladies" (false). What have we seen the first sequence of events, wrong, then? <br /> <br /> A terrible choice in the casting, a complicated and complicated plot and a direction style that induces the headaches. 1/5
