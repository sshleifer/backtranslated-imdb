I tried to see this movie without really being able to sit down, because even though it is supposed to have a "good" message; The problem is that it obviously occurs according to a particular interpretation of the Scriptures. An interpretation, in my opinion, will deceive many people. Also, I'm a maniac from the movie and the acting in this movie was completely unacceptable. I had never wanted a negative score before to rate a movie. So, if you want to be preached unceasingly by those without authority, then by all means, get this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who like or love scifi, because the title will also deceive many people. This was an unfortunate movie, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were wasted. The only redeemable quality of the movie is that it made me realize that the character of "Time Machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the strange behavior of those in his future.
