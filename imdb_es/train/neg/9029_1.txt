This film virtually wastes the talents of all actors in what could best be called a "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite its opening full of action 'Top Gun', everything is downhill from there with many stereotypes and unlikely situations. following each other until he tries to drown himself with his popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many story lines with no way out in this movie that I was guessing at a time when it was made by joining a discarded television series. <br /> <br /> The role of Quinn's Mexican drug lord is ridiculous and his 'associates' were taken from a police program of the 1970s in Quinn-Martin. Costner's character is made of wood and does not give us any reason to believe that he really fell in love with MÃ©ndez's wife. Nor are we convincingly led to believe that the wife is anxious to have company and will skip the first hot body that comes. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 'B' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved.
