This is a simple story but it feels very manipulative. It lacks pathos, as it leaves no room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I think it's too representative. I would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then I would not seem so kitsch. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood-style movie it works well, but it's very derivative of Aardman movies and this bothers me. Perhaps a longer movie will prove if this manufacturer can dispense with the voiceover. <br /> <br /> I think the voiceover is too simplistic.
