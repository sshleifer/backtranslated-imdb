This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of junk in history. It really is amazing that something so completely terrible can be done. But, if you can handle the plot, the development of the character and the direction that numb the mind, you can get a kick out of the soundtrack that is so frightening that it's funny. The movie starts terribly and quickly becomes unrecoverable. Someone should give some consolation to anyone involved in this film because their career was probably ruined due to their participation in this movie. If you end up watching this movie or have already seen it (I feel your pain), then these words have come too late. For any other person, stay away at all costs or keep in mind that the movie is so bad that you will lose 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clean or something while you see it.
