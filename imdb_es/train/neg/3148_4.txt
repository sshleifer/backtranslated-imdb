Essentially a man-versus-nature story, this film has a beautiful cinematographic picture, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never really begins. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and is then attracted by the foreman of the plantation, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of the late father of owner Peter Finch, whose ghost takes a pack on Elephant Walk, which becomes an important point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to claim their traditional path to the water that was blocked when the mansion was built on their right of way. The beasts go on a rampage and provide the best moments of action in the image. Taylor and Andrews have some good times as they struggle to remain a faithful wife despite the marital difficulties with Finch.
