I loved seeing the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, a compelling story, a great soundtrack, direct (Kitamura mola!), Edit, not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto that filled the part perfectly . So I really wanted to see Azumi 2, but after seeing it I finally felt that I had won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 takes the place where Azumi left it, however, these are two completely different movies. rhythm is much slower, the action is not so exciting and is well choreographed and there is not much character development, apparently, this was led by the same person responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if possible !) I agree with some other previous critics who say that this was a missed opportunity, if only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this delivery, however, there is a beautiful Japanese forest landscape to watch as the slow action develops and we briefly presents small characters who kill themselves quickly, even the real bad ones kill each other too easily without too much fighting The fight with the spider boy (out of an ep Monkey isodium!) in the bamboo forest was almost everyone. Memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a fight scene with barrel chamber effects, Azumi 2 brought us Azumi's layer camera !! The uproar of Azumi in the end was not convincing, but Aya still does a good job. He looks great in the cape ... but where did he get it from? I do not think I'll see this again and again! ...What a pity.
