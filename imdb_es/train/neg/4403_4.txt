Whatever the merits of the film, it is little investigated. As others have pointed out, the film shows locals from Iran who speak Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone with the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the real one. <br /> <br /> Other errors of fact: it shows that a train is operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railroads. The Turkish ambassador wears a Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the film was developed. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I guess the filmmakers intended to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.
