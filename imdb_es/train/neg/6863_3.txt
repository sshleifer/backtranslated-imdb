My God, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The final sequence, once again, is handled quite effectively and was absolutely hilarious. For that you get those three points. Apart from that, it was atrocious. it was not meant to be so funny, that's obvious, but the dubbing, the performance of the voices dubbed, the dialogue they said, were often hilarious. The actions taken and / or not performed also lead to much hilarity and / or throw things to the screen. like when the whole village is being killed and a small group of people stand on a balcony looking as if they were looking at a cooking glass, or the "attempt" escapes from the church in which they are locked up. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you must go up and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: now is my chance to make an idiot come out and shake with fire being totally ineffective and hacked. <br /> <br /> insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: damn it, wait, I'll get this little girl and she'll walk outside and cry dad, seemingly obvious from the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers, but they're actually zombies without flesh or skin or anything, and she will drive them away and flee! insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> hero (above): he's trying to escape again, fool, and left the door open, he's stupid, this is a good view. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> hero (now below): I do not know, I can not see her anyway and she was not outside because I could not see her even though I was out there and I had a view of the whole neighborhood and she It's standing right outside, where could it be? <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that anyone would be throwing things to the screen after 10 minutes of this. So, watch the first movie with a couple of friends, have a few drinks and make sure that by the time you see this movie, you are absolutely blind and can laugh at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even a decent blood, a pity.
