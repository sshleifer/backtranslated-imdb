I really did not expect much from "The Night Listener" and I never really heard anything until I saw the cover in the videostore. However, the film is very effective when it comes to increasing the suspension and tension. Sometimes drag a bit, but it really helps you to ask yourself what will happen and, most importantly, when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into a kind of "cat and mouse" speech to the point where he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth and the existence of a 14-year-old abused child that nobody It seemed I have ever seen it in person. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great for increasing suspense throughout the movie and practically keeps you in the dark of who is lying and what is real. However, in the end it is somewhat disappointing and is not up to the potential it could have had. It does not really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been useful and interesting.
