I may not have been the biggest fan of Blair Witch, but I still appreciated that effort, so I looked forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown in various IMDb comments. "Unique", "intelligent", "A cult classic future" and so on ... you should ask yourself where those people who describe such a poor effort come up with. <br /> <br /> Because, unfortunately, Altered is a poor and weak film that does not get involved in any way. Stupidity is not funny. Horror and blood are not scary. And whatever the "thought" aspect that some of the poor see in this film was due to severe delusions because there is certainly nothing profound or intelligent in this mess. <br /> <br /> Well, then we know that nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is it worth the experience in any way? Unfortunately not. To start, get very bad performance. It is not an exaggeration to say that most B movies these days present a better performance. The plot? Bored and messy. Dialogues? Many fans really do it better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction that the puzzles are. I did not expect big improvements on Blair Witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsened over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major defect in Altered, it is the main set. An important part of the plot takes place in one place, where the main characters are confined, but Sanchez has not given any personality to the place. Bearing in mind that in Blair Witch, the forest plays an important role and is both a character (an antagonist, if you prefer) and the three students, one would think that the director would realize that the same thing was needed here. But no ... this place has no personality thanks to careless management and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing here that can be saved. The fans of "Blair Witch" are better following Daniel Myrick. Although its production is far from being gold, it shows a better structure than Sanchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).
