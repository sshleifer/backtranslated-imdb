How did this come to be? In general, I love Sci F / Bigfoot movies, etc. . But I still hope that they will be written without so much cheese like this. The effects were sad, the saddest lines. Avoid at all costs. I just finished renting it because I was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson in it, I have not seen it yet). The idea of ​​the movie is really good. There was a lot of potential to make a great big movie here. I just do not understand how something like this ends like this. Go talk to students interested in film / art / English at any high school and you will find people who can write a better script.
