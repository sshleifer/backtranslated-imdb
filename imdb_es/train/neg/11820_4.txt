['I saw this on a DVD (it is known as CORRUPT in this format) and the cover&#39;s propaganda really exaggerated how Frank, the character of Harvey Keitel, looks a lot like the one who played BAD LIEUTENANT in &quot;This bold and powerful police thriller&quot; . What the cover did not mention was that this is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music that he does not put on the CD player, he pulls out a lot of plastic pancakes, places it on a kind of turntable where a kind of mechanical arm plays the pancake thing making the music heard . Do you see my point that this movie is old? The DVD case gave no clue that it was a film made 20 years ago. It is also a film with poor production values like many other Italian films that pose as Americans. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is horrible, although Johnny Rotten&#39;s interpretation is more strange than terrible, the cinematography is static with the quality of image and sound that gives the impression that he was watching a pirated copy of the fourth generation (no I know if it is an unreliable DVD or if it is a very bad impression of the movie) and the worst of all is the Ennio Morricone score. It is impossible to believe that the man who did the irritating and intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who made music for Clint Eastwood&#39;s westerns. <br /><br /> All this is a shame because CORRUPT has its moments. It is not, in any way, the best psychological thriller that has ever been devised, but it did interest me and, as always, Keitel offers a good performance as a violent policeman. Only a pity that the rest of the film did not match its high standards']
