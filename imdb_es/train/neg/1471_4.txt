This kind of movie has already gone old, right? All this is a mellow nostalgia that is transmitted on itself in some kind of feedback loop. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good idea: a great cast, some gags and some human dramas about what could / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that links them all, as was the case in "The Big Chill," one of those seminal films that generated imitation films like this one. You end up wanting to see more than one or two people in particular, instead of having a short view of everyone. The superficiality that this creates is not only annoying, it is maddening. The script below the average does not help.
