This was, until now, the worst movie I've seen in my entire life, and I've seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the film was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene where nobody talks, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they simply drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with an annoying, incredible dialogue and, basically, there is no argument to talk about. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it could be a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
