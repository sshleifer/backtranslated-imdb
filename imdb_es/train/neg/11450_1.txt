I was able to see a preview of this movie and I hope you have time to edit it in the way you can to improve it before it leaves on August 3. It stars Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a double like his late father. When we meet him, he is jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and he almost does it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he did not honestly try to do this. Isla Fisher plays the girl next door, a little older and much more mature, Denise. It seems he likes Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his stepbrother, Kevin, who documents the tricks with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. He remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough guy who enjoys defeating Rod in some real fights. It is clear that Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat him. We discovered that Frank needs $ 50,000. Heart Transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he can 'bang his ass' once he has healed and prove he is a man. A long fall on the side of a mountain convinces Rod to "go big" in a trick. Rod is getting ready to get start-up money by doing tricks that would make you tremble if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch, at a children's birthday party. There were those in the show who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, a sponsor appears who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. It obtains the exclusive transmission rights and establishes telephone lines to obtain donations. Rod gets a new suit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns and the world tunes in. Does he jump? Does he get the girl? Do the $ 50k go up? Frank gets his ass for Rod? Wait until this 90-minute movie comes out on video to find out.
