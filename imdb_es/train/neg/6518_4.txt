The movie is quite funny and involves about four dates, then it becomes a sassy commercial for a guy that you (and even his "friends") can not really bear. It's a pretty interesting concept; Dates of the movie in a quest to find true love in modern Los Angeles. The problem is that it feels incredibly (and wrong) with scripts sometimes and blatantly self-promoting. It is difficult to worry and be attracted to any of the characters because the writer / actor is very selfish, it is not great, it is not true and simply does not like it. You end up feeling sorry for your appointments.
