Banned as a 'Nasty Video' in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained considerable notoriety. However, the most impressive thing I found about the film was its amateur character in all the departments. The sangria I could handle: the terrible performance, the poor quality of the editing, the bad direction, the bad script and the abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls on their way to a music festival hit a ravine during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, a crazy old woman and her spinster daughter, welcome the girls, allowing them to stay a few days to recover. However, someone does not want girls to ever leave! One by one, they are victims of an invisible assailant. <br /> <br /> Taking a lot of time to get going and presenting some of the worst performances in a horror movie (and that's missing), Unhinged is a really horrible movie. Music is a total disaster (it seems like a synthesizer has let out a three-year-old child) and as such, complements the film perfectly. Just a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of free nudity, except Unhinged, to get the lowest score possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a complete of the horrors (and unfortunately, I am), you will want to look at this to mark it in the Nasty Video playlist. But be careful, it's really very bad.
