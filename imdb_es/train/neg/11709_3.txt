Have you heard that he lives every moment as if he were the last? Whether it's your last day or not, I beg you not to waste any part watching this! Nichole Hiltz offers some nice moments of candy for the eyes (which, unfortunately, remain involved) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or the ads for dog food. An unrealistic and unrealistic plot with a terrible dialogue means that there is no "Art" in the "Art of Revenge". <br /> <br />
