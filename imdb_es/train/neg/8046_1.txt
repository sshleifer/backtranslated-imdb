Do not? I do not think so! Well, in that case, all you have to do is stay far, far away from "Do You Wanna Know A Secret", since it is only the meaningless position after the "Scream" with absolutely no redeeming value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; The characters are unbearably stupid, the bloody factor is insignificant and everything is simply boring! As you can already derive from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer", since the events take place in a similar environment and the motivations of the murderer are equally stupid. Why would someone want to steal junk ideas like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least that movie could depend on the beautiful shelf of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls of this junk are, in addition to brainless, terribly unattractive. A year after the still unresolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simple-minded college students go to Florida to spend their spring break in a luxurious beach house. The killer has not made any moves throughout the year, but now he follows the gang to Florida and begins to kill them while leaving the titular message as a kind of business card. You do not really need to be a horror expert to quickly discover what face is hidden behind the indescribably ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong path are downright embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the secondary plots regarding the incompetent Florida police force and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to solve. The murder happens inexplicably outside the screen (do not you hate it when that happens?), There is not even free T & A to enjoy and it is better that you do not let me know the quality of the dialogues. Suffering through this shit only makes you realize that the charming spirit of the slashers of the 80s is gone forever.
