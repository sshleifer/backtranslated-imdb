Well, we all love the sprites of daisies, but what about this cast? Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there's not a single thing about this girl, and Daisy was not fancy! Uncle Jesse was probably closest to resembling the original. No offense to Burt, but I never realized that Boss HOg was so tall. That was part of Boss Hog's humor, it was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito? Ok, now you understand this, Jessica Simpson, did anyone have a look at her husband? He paired Luke Duke to a shirt !!! Clearly these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's was never present in the dukes! This caused the movie to go out from the beginning. I give this a huge applause down.
