Alan Rudolph is a regular director, without that special touch. As an example, there was a shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists at the dental clinic that could have expressed the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted it. The camera is in the hallway looking through the doors of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave alone in their respective rooms. You have the idea of ​​its desolation and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could have been greatly improved. If he were directing, it would have happened all day, if necessary, to make the shot correctly. That is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so many lifetimes, in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> The shot with the little boy stepping on the pool of vomit could have improved. The girl should have shown more fascination for the puddle, should have stomped and shuffled her feet, should have tilted her head to look at the puddle with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays a non-communicative man, it is true, but instead of transmitting his internal confusion in voice, gesture, body movement, the film is based on narration and dialogue with his imaginary alter-ego macho, played by Denis Leary.
