There is not much to say about this. Gammera is a kind of turtle that breathes fire. He is liberated by a nuclear explosion. He goes to the land and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other waste (oh yes, power lines. I almost forgot). At one point, at the beginning of the film, he befriends a small child, and instead of throwing or crushing it, he places it on the floor. Insurance. From that moment, we have to see this little chubby cheetah appear and flee, appear and flee, appear and flee. For some reason, Gammera can listen to this child from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to a place where he can be put aboard a rocket and launched into space. As usual, the monster is heavy and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and fire to solve the national debt and, of course, it does not help. You should know this anyway. We have seen many monsters trample in Tokyo. Do not leave this because they can be fun, but in reality it's not very good.
