Well, this is the first post I commented on IMDb. If you get it, this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls that they will stop experimenting with movies. <br /> <br /> Like most of them I have given your comments, I thought about watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors (although after having read the worst criticism against this movie), I thought about experiencing it assuming that It was a comedy movie. Well, everything started well with some examples. ., comedies ... then everything started to become pathetic ... man, you can believe yourself, you feel like going and hitting your head every time the pathetic looking woman called heroine of the movie becomes impotent. ..Huh ~~ Well, how much can a person digest a sick and POSSESSIVE person, like a ghost trying to do everything possible to irritate you and stop you from doing what you are doing? <br /> <br /> The following is the worst. The movie is, the hero "ZOMBIE", yes, while losing her boyfriend, she wanders like a goat, with black marks. With his eyes, and with the "terribly stupid" sister of the hero ... you would be bleeding from head to toe if you tried and succeeded in seeing this movie completely!
