Obviously, when you offer enough money to an actor, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves received, but most of the money he earned must go to his fans as an excuse even for being associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of the B films of 1950 and the performance of the rest of the cast was even worse. As for how bad the acting was, one child gave the second best performance in my opinion. English was terribly stressed and I think no one could really speak English, they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character "real" and real.
