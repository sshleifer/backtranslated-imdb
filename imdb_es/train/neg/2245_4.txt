This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I do not deny the talent of Barbra Streisand at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work and, therefore, I can not judge him. However, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. He is slow, has rude nudity and foul language, and it can be very difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like Judy Garland's version is better. Watch the 1976 movie with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.
