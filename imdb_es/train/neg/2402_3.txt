A surprising failure of Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries to be funny and fails miserably, even with decent turns of Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin seems embarrassed throughout his performance and his son Adam simply seems numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
