I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing more to see. It's one of those movies where you stop to see what it is, just for a moment! - But after twenty minutes, more or less, you can not turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere between being so bad is good and so bad is, well, just BAD, it's worth seeing it alone to experience the confusion of realizing that it is both! Great mid-night rate, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Do not even bother asking yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is obviously a man, because logic does not apply.
