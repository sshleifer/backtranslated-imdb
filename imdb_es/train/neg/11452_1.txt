['If I could have rated this movie for 0, I would have done it! I see that some people in IMDb say that this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. Excuse me? Are you ppl snlting LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie. NOTHING! I really want my 27 minutes back from my life that I spent watching this shit. <br /><br /> I read someone sitting on a plane watching this movie, I stopped seeing it after 30 minutes, I fully understand that I would actually have seen snakes on a plane 2 times instead of watching this movie once. <br /><br /> DO NOT SEE this movie, do another thing useful with your life, wash the dishes, walk the dog, hell ... anything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching hot rod.']
