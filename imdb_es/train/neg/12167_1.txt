Despite being a sequel to the most powerful original, this is more a comic remake on Friday the 13th, in relation to the antics of the psychopath Angela, who kills more nubile teenagers for their "immorality" in a camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some pretty funny sex scenes with some pretty attractive girls, but the movie is very funny (not intentional) instead of suspense, it's a stench. <br /> <br /> * of ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: R rating for graphic violence, gore, nudity and for some sexuality, language and drug use.
