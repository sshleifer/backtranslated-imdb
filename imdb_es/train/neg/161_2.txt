If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a street pimp in New York or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you could believe Pat Boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could possibly enjoy this movie. <br /> <This movie is so stupid that it's not even a countryside for a love story without sex in the mid-1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood did so much because of Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman that was not on his wife's screen before its release, that the public knows he will not kiss Shirley Jones, so he can not generate any anticipation for the "screen consummation". of his love It's like watching a western in which the cowboys have no weapons. <br /> <br /> The story does not make sense. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst box of movie offers along with Ishtar and Plan 9 of Outer Space.
