Unfortunately, this movie does not give any credit to the original. Nicholas Cage, quite wooden in regards to the actors, imbues the screen with a wide range of skills, from which he does not get carried away by the top. The distribution of support is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot is still very similar to the original in terms of progression of the scene, but it is much worse. Not enough details are given to allow the audience to see what is being sold. It turns out that it's just a bill for poor goods. Unbelief can not be suspended, nor can an adjustment of doubt be given. The only aspect of saving this movie is that it is highly visual, as required by the medium, and whoever has explored the location should be praised. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, in The End. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
