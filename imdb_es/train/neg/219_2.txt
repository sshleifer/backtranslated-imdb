It COULD have been a good movie if I had explored something more interesting instead of just the surface of a lesbian relationship if that were the meaning of the movie ... it's quite predictable without mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group tATu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing original about this film that supports it, so they had to use something that is already famous. You already know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role is. Most of them are well known people in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (for example, Mihaela Radulescu). So, to summarize it: "girl band tatty" + desperate / publicity that needs "actors" + a non-existing conspire + the occasion to use a bad language to shock = sick love ... very bad ... the idea was good, however ... and I am seriously arguing about the title ...
