Basically, I found that the Eden Curve is very poorly constructed, which makes it difficult to observe. However, there is something I must say about how the director caught something on the atmosphere of the early 70s in the choice of settings and clothes. The philosophy of "going back to earth" and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as shown in many later versions of the 70s, were correct, as was the pseudo - "do not ask no say "liberalism of the fraternity formed by intellectuals from the East Coast, except that I would have thought it more likely that it was a New England school instead of one in Virginia, where I imagine that the" good boy "mentality still dominated elite schools like this one. Another thing that I appreciated and with which I could relate is that this was a time when homosexuality was not so linked to queens or dragged, and I appreciated some homosexual roles unrelated to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that the "gay culture" took certain standard forms in the 80s off Castro and Christopher streets, and these defined the movement and left out a large number of gay men who were more subdued in their styles of lifetime. I appreciated the movie mainly as a way of remembering in the most natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene".
