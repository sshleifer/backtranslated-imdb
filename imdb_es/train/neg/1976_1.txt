How is it possible that such a bad movie can be made? Bad acting Bad script Just a shame everywhere. This is just one bad clich√© after another. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie has some big name stars. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This movie barely made money for a good reason. The appeal of black jeans movies simply does not exist. It's a shame they did not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big name stars in it.
