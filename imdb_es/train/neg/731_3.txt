Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends in his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests confess and face their worst fears ... Mike tries to invoke the spirit of his late father. Soon it is discovered that the spirit of Morty inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins. <br /> <br /> Most of the F / X are not very convincing and the film acquires a slasher theme for teenagers. Past history acted pitifully. The featured cast members are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
