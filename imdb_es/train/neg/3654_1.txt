In the 17th century in Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 flies from the King of Spain. While in the sea a violent storm swallows its precious gold destined to buy arms and almost takes the life. Mayeda must fight all odds to survive and secure the fate of her beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is an epic multi-million dollar action adventure on three continents. <br /> <br /> Starring movie legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings trilogy, Indiana Jones trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Blood Throne), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a masterpiece of the film. <br /> <br /> The doubles team that won Osaka bought from Bob Ivy's screen brings exciting battle / action sequences, such as the initial battle against the Eastern Army, the attack on Mayeda's ship with valuable jewels incalculable and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. There is also a good musical score by the famous composer John Scott. The director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film that deals with emotional struggles such as the death of the Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after the duel, all of which are extremely well resolved. Cinematographic masterpiece highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Note: All the above is the opposite of the film in question.
