SMALL SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I woke up late and saw this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's previous works like "Boyz n the hood". However, I have to say that this was a big disappointment and it is all I hate about the movies of "messages" invented, clich√©. <br /> <br /> The performance is mainly deficient (pop stars and models are NOT necessarily good actors ... take note), situations are difficult to swallow (the rape victim becomes a lesbian of the overnight ... please!), but worst of all is that it reinforces every spoiled stereotype you can imagine. In the second half of the film, it has become a caricature as in its characterization, which makes you lose any part of the empathy that you could have had with its one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once is there a reference to any valid point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it simply ends up sensationalizing the results of these problems. His message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of cohesive plot. As for the conclusion of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning", I have to say that all I learned is to avoid seeing this again. <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the topics on which this film is not developed. then hire "American History X" ... unless you were only watching it for Tyra Banks, then hire a life.
