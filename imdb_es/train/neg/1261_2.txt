I'm a fan of Jean Harlow, because she had a star quality. I do not think her films are good and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she was certainly great in comedies. All the comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this case and you can forget the rest of the cast: their performances do not bring anything new. I am always impressed to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks beautiful.
