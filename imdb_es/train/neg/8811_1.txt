SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie and I did not like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: Bored. Almost nothing happens, the women sit down and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke marijuana, they read magazines, they take care of their sick friends and they cut the occasional corpse. BORED! <br /> <br /> Second reason: too many things are left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps men at random, holds them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know something about illegal activities related to sick meat eaters? Why does he kill one and let another go? <br /> <br /> There's also this guy who at first I thought he also had the disease of eating meat, but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength, suggesting it's not quite right. What we originally thought we never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the tedious duologo and the non-existent action. In addition, the cover is misleading, since it makes you believe that this movie will be great when clearly it is not. I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people have enjoyed this movie, from now on I will make sure to read more than two reviews in a movie. To avoid renting another movie I regret having seen it.
