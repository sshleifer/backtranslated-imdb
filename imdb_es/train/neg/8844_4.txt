I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie". I wanted to like this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was pretty bad. If the story was only about a young man who fell in love with a girl who suffered from parasomnia, then it would have been a better movie. <br /> <br /> The center of attention stretched the credulity beyond limits, in fact It was pretty ridiculous. The doctor cheerfully ignores privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse enters a room to feed a dangerous patient (without security escort), drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the villain of the movie) is tied up in a fully clothed standing position, apparently for years? None of that makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The film even had some actors that I liked in other things, like the detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
