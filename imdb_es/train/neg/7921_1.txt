The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what remains that is different from the other film consists of strange extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> I think this movie would be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb, if someone had seen it. The plot is disconnected and, in several (too many) cases, it does not make any sense at all. The real wonder here is why in this world was created this sequel to such an unsuccessful and horrific movie (but still something better). <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh.
