You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The Safety Pin Killer! That's right, in Killer Workout, a movie of fools if I've ever seen one, the invisible killer sends his victims with a security pin of great size and novelty. It's a strange choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Naturally, the film does not even try to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is under the siege of a crazy killer and everyone is suspicious. In fact, the film gives so few clues about the identity of the murderer, almost everyone in the film are possible murderers until they are killed. And since almost everyone, but the killer ends up dead, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, while the full name of the cast is eliminated, the aerobics classes continue in earnest. In fact, nothing is able to stop the dance. While three men are killed in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; a character dies, but still looks prominently in subsequent training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he named the film Killer Workout and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Police persecutions, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of photos of women's exposed flesh are thrown to a large extent. Like the woman trapped in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Killer Workout. Finally, fortunately, THE END appeared on the screen. What happened after? You have it, you take the women doing exercise. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
