After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or if the cinema sound system could be faulty. At least during the first half of the movie, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying due to the background music 20 and the scratch of the sound track. I was willing to blame the film crew, but it was not like that, it was the Director. <br /> <br /> They told me that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and sound were supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, the directors will do everything possible to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that movie, the sound score will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find for yourself elsewhere), the sound track. Distortions are in themselves a good reason for this film to be lost. You will only hear the distorted screech of the sound track and certainly not the meow of a cat.
