A missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a cell phone called "Pon". A missed call was as boring as that. Maybe the phones are simply not scary or something, but this movement was boring and monotonous. No tension or emotion for me, and the final monster was disappointingly corny and without fear. The film crawled enough in different parts and felt too long. I did not keep my attention. It seems that phones are hard to make frightening, it's like trying to make a pop vending machine look weird. And it is ridiculous to compare this with "The Ring", it seems that all Asian horror films are compared to this and so far I have not seen any that is up to the task. To the directors of terror: pick up the phone as a device of horror.
