He gave me this movie because he had a great premise, the friendship of three women surrounded by a girl in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing! <br /> <br /> NO! I hasten to add. These women are drawn in extreme caricature, do not support each other and conspire and insist on defeating each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not do anything wrong in my book before seeing this. but here they are given a grim script and told that balance between slapstick and screwball action that does not work very well when women are professionals well known in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for smart women spend a lot of time lamenting the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt I could have done much more than that given decent and more tension script, the subplot of lesbians did not get anywhere and smokers / drinkers women (¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿- to hell with the baby, give me a cigarette Right <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame to waste 4 out of 10!...
