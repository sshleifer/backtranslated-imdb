This is how you do it: believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things should change within the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this film is presented as a bad summary of the horrible life of a drunk. His mom dies. Your stepmother is a whore. His father dies He drinks. He marries He has children He drinks a little more. His wife is angry. He disappoints his children. The wife threatens to leave. Call a reverend late at night because he wants to commit suicide. Then, after the summary occurs, it is when we receive the subtle message "Left Behind". <br /> <br /> "I needed a paycheck." This is the phrase that I had to repeat again and again once the credits started rolling so as not to lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen kneels and asks for Christ's forgiveness. Once he does, he walks outside and actually says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God and that is good enough for her. He changes the scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. The film ends while Madsen walks through the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? Give a disdainful little salute to the bar (ie, no house) and give a gay, Miami-Vice, a special greeting jump after school in the air when the camera freezes. Do you see why I had to repeat the phrase? "I needed a paycheck." <br /> <br /> Man, this movie is bad. The production values ​​of B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could easily have been an episode of "Touched by an Angel". It could have been eliminated in 30 minutes more ads. The performance is wooden and never credible. Even Madsen, of whom I am a big fan and is the only reason I sat through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he still does not know what his $$ of his elbow is on the camera . 45 minutes later I started to get discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to save it and say it's okay, I saw half. That is good enough. But no. If I sat in Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit down during all this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen". Demande me 2) Part of the dialogue is so bad that it is classic. I'm going to put some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> That's it. To wrap it, this thing is a piece of garbage that should be flush with the rest of the turds. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also INCLINATION, EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVE, MY CHIEF'S DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to look again at Reservoir Dogs and see Madsen torture a cop to get my respect for him. See you, children. <br /> <br /> "This will make me blind, but I'll drink it anyway" - Madsen's first cheap alcohol test <br /> <br /> "I do not do it" I understand! Everything looks so beautiful! "- Madsen walks outside after confessing with God <br /> <br />" Then I will go to the center and I will pick up a bible and I will also cut my hair "- Madsen after moving to the table, because Satan lives in your hair
