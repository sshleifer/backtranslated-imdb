I do not like this movie very much. If you have read Puzo's books, or at least you have seen the first two films very closely (especially the first one), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Corleone saga presented By Puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends up getting nowhere, although it seems to go in some direction during the movie. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that different moments are expected for the Corleone saga in the 90s, and that we will not do it. Find things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films, in contexts when they did not fit. Because this? It sounds like those badly made sequels that only try to copy the qualities of the original movie. <br /> <br /> What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino came together to do this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather should be forgiven for almost anything he does in the movies until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo should not have written this. How? It damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90s story about the mafia, and it's great. We can never say the same about the story of Godfather III.
