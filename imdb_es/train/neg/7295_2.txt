First of all, the reason I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk had his usual fantastic acting as Lieutenant Columbo. Only he can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise completely useless attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, everything got excited when reading the comment of a poster that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave "the performance of his career." For me, it was Stevens' abysmal performance that completely ruined this movie, so I was prepared to throw all kinds of insults at the person who made the comment mentioned above. Then I thought, what else has Stevens done? So I checked it out and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently, each of the 33 projects that Stevens has been working on since has been total bullshit, so it's doubtful that anyone has seen the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, look at all the other 69 titles before seeing this one. Do yourself a favor and keep the worst for last.
