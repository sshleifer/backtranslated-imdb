Is this the movie? Is this what the Indians are trying to show? I think this is one more effort of a sickly-minded director to reject the Pakistani soldiers and, in fact, the country ... but what we Pakistanis know is that we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... not only in armed counters. <br /> <br /> Well ... this is badly filmed like Border's in early 1997 ... and the director and writer tried to overcome the shame of defeat in Kargil by the Pakistani armed forces, creating films like these ... <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India ... we will win ...! So Mr. Dutta tries to make some good movies instead of pointless movies like this one.
