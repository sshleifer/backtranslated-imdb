"The Lady and the Duke" by Eric Rohmer is based on the diaries of an English aristocrat who lived through the French Revolution. But it is a forced issue, with its strange painted backgrounds and its polite conversation tone. In particular, this portrait of the age of terror takes place almost completely at a time far from the real action; In this film you can see very little of ordinary people, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that was unfolded far from the chambers of the aristocratic classes persecuted, but ruined. The result is often boring and, ultimately, ill-informed about the forces that sometimes bring societies to the brink of destruction; It's a disappointing movie by an acclaimed director.
