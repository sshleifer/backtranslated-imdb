First let me be honest. I did not see this whole movie. I watched the first five minutes and, when I realized that I had almost fallen asleep, I decided that I could also move faster and see if it got more interesting later ... It was not like that. This movie is just a collection of raucous attempts to make a story that is no longer interesting and is misspelled in something that would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I think it's important to say that even a film with poor special effects can be good if it's well made. This movie is not and it will only put you in a deep sleep if you try to see it. Finally, I think it's important to say that I think this movie is public domain, so if you think you should see it at all, a search on the Internet will show you a place where you will not have to pay to see this. cinematic dung pile.
