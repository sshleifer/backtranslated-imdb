(Also known as: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television, although it was filmed in English and never intended to be a sequel to the previous DEMONS films. It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava launched it. <br /> <br /> A US family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself when she was a small girl who went down to the old wine cellar of this village and found this structure similar to a cocoon that hung from the ceiling. It shines and is covered with cobwebs and has what appears to be a spider or insect legs dangling from it. It drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe any of this. The villa is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and should ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE appears in what looks like a kind of Centaury 16 costume with what looks like the head of a wolf and is attracted by the aroma of the orchids. <br /> <br /> The movies are not so bad and at least the dialogue is almost intelligent without the ridiculous uncomfortable phrases that the dubbing would bring. . There is no more gore than the skeletons that rot in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. OGRE itself simply vanishes after being run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD that I saw was defective, with the image in black for a few seconds about a half hour after the movie, an error that I hope Shriek has corrected since then. The extras include a brief interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains that this was not a sequel, etc..etc ... along with some advances to other DVD releases of Shriek. This is quite standard. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
