This film is incarnate fondness, a direct 11/10 on the scale of fonitud. The falseness of the accents, as well as the tightness of the spandex cardigan pants are amazing. Yanks, although the real Scotland can be just as colorful, if you ever go there, do not expect to be given the opportunity to "dance" the controversies with the locals. Also, do not try to influence local opinion through the art of upholstery, which would otherwise be excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of infectious scenes of singing and dancing, but the plot is too corny and linear, and the dialogue is usually too weak. I also doubt that anyone would want to be trapped in an eighteenth-century Scottish village with hobbies in the cities of New York, rather than in the gay city of New York. Maybe it was not such a big sacrifice for the priest to have left Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get out of that garbage dump. <br /> <br /> Watch it to see the excellent alternative reality vision of what a Christopher Streed's day parade in Scotland would look like in LSD. Other than that, I would only recommend it to the Hollywood finalists.
