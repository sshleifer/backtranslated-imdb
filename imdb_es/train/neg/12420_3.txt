There just is not enough here. There are some fun places, but not enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I hoped this was a hidden gem. WAS NOT. It was a hidden shit. <br /> <br /> All the time I was watching her, I was thinking: "Geez, I could do better than that and I'm a jerk." Do not believe the few good reviews. I was caught by them. At no time did I laugh out loud. Maybe this was funny or avant-garde in 1987, but man, today fell flat. This movie had a promise, it just did not fulfill it. Maybe if they rewrote it a couple more times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they just did not have much to work with. This movie failed due to frayed writing. Very disappointed
