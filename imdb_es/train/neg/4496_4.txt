This film is a cringe festival of bad acting and bad set design, as well as sticky lines and an unconvincing argument. But it's very fun to watch it. Everything is fun. The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future who travel in time to capture their evil co-worker who tries to destroy them all. They reached it in the year 1146. The 'futuristic' laboratory of the scientists of the year 2033 is an eighties style room with a lot of 'futuristic' buttons and a time capsule that looks like a grass shed. The actors deliver their lines with a halfhearted aplomb, which is not difficult to understand, since the lines are often shaky as "I've checked everything twice!" Did you check everything twice? Did you check it four times? Not only that, but they provide you with the entire premise of the film in the first five minutes and continue at an accelerated pace until they reach the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And he had to stop traveling through time and consequently the different sets. The medieval set is a comic mix of everything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any suit they could find, they used it. I guess the chain mail was not in the budget, because all the boys wear shirts with sequins disguised as armor. The fight scenes are fun, with men casually throwing themselves on cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death shots without a single blow. It sounds really horrible, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The lines are just enough to keep you in shape and everything else comes together to create a fabulous B movie that, if you're a connoisseur of corny movies, I suggest you watch. And once you've done it, read the review in Unknown Movies. I love listening to them point out all the funny and truly horrible fragments of the movie.
