When I saw this movie, around 1979, it became the first film I came out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that simply misses being funny, and this is lost every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original in any of the parodies. While I enjoy spicy humor when appropriate, these parodies were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more annoying was that this film was announced as "the first film of Robin William", taking advantage of his new fame found in the television series "Mork and Mindy". However, his role turned out to be so small that you can not even notice it on the screen.
