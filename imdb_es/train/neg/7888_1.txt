I did not know anything about the movie or that it was based on a great selling book. I tried to guess from the initial scenes what it would be about, what would be better, a buried treasure and a list of deaths. That lasted about 15 minutes when I got the furtive suspicion that the movie was crap. I will not bore you with how bad the plot and the performance were, but anyone who has given more than two stars should work for the filmmakers. I watched until the hero jumped to his corvette to rush to The Hospital. He had his put on his suit, shirt and tie that arrived at the hospital in jeans and in / shirt. I could not even have the correct continuity. I have the Christian theme, it's hard to miss it.
