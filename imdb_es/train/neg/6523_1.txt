TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY COMPLETE REVIEW. I DO NOT CHOOSE THE FILM IN ITSELF, ONLY THE DVD VERSIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film even two stars. I mean, how could it be a mere 1 out of 10 ??? <br /> <br /> Here is how: an epic film adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the Red Army. , and an extremely faithful adaptation, scene by scene of the novel would be difficult, but it is worth sitting for seven hours, if that is what I was seeing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see that. Movie: anywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I am trying to see the RusCiCo DVD version - widely considered the best available version, since it is in a mailbox and restores scenes that were deleted from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But, it's one of the worst prints of movies I've seen transferred to DVD. The image is muddy and inconsistent, often strobe. It is almost tolerable if you increase the brightness, color and image levels to the maximum ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also very inconsistent, with a very high volume in some parts, practically Inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And as for languages, it's a BIG problem for English speakers: the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible ones, whose performance roles and parts of the film are not bent at all, returning to Russian and even to French at random. <br /> <br /> The subtitled option is not much better. The subtitles do not appear below the image, but just above it, hiding some of the beauty (or what remains of it) in the landscape. In addition, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a pity, since the script struggled to be so close to Tolstoy's actual words), and the subtitles also seem to disappear in parts. <br /> <br /> Therefore, even if you maximize the color, brightness and picture settings, turn up the volume and choose subtitled * e * dubbed in English, you will still get a movie that is annoying to watch and hear. <br /> <br /> Can the content overcome that? I could have been able to do it, but at seven o'clock, who can bear it that much? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday, someone will come and re-establish it, and maybe see a masterpiece, but for now, I just can not give more than one star to something that I could only stand watching the first 12 % of.
