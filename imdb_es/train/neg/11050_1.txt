Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost, either by horrible scripts or lethargic direction. That villainous robot ... Have you been a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst sound tracks I've heard (monologues usually drown with music). And ... where did they get their supports? That ship looks like a carton of milk ... I made better special effects in 8 mm at the age of 13! <br /> <br /> I would recommend that any film student should watch this movie (5 minutes at a time) so that how to learn NOT to produce a movie. Or ... was it the publishers' fault? <br /> <br /> It really is very bad, because the scenario was really a good concept ... just badly executed in every way. (Sorry, Malcolm, you should have sent a "double double." You're too good an actor for such a fetid bomb.)
