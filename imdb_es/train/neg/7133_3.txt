I felt I was watching Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different storyline. I will say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you'll probably find this movie somewhat entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I've seen her since Days of our lives. She is a very good singer, but very badly, they gave her such bad songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; It's not exactly what you would do here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a bit of leeward, but in real life I do not think an average girl meets a sexy girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car. motor, and be a lead singer. It is simply very silly. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone willing to bet 25 million on a race car is crazy. But it was a bit great at the end when Natasha stops just before the finish line and screws Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car fans. So, if you like fast cars, then I recommend this.
