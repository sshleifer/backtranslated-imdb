-Me and my sister we have to see that movie right now. We laugh at the deaf. Can you imagine on the covers there is a nomination for the Oscar? --first, the musician mixes about 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- the main character Silvester It does not fit there it looks like Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- The Russian soldiers are everything, but not the Russian faces :-) ----- Ok, the main points: 1. Airplane called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea when Rambo is going to jump off the plane, but it gets stuck? string mix 3. a girl? The best scene is when she dies. She means a lot to him. Have you known her for years? cry for her, or my god samurai 4. How many arrows do you have? Is your bag of arrows always full of arrows? I did not notice a scene in which he collected them, but I have seen the scene where the arrow remains in the welding head of Vietnam. This is very important. How many rockets can the helicopter contain? (real) I've seen 4. but Rambos has hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. the main part. What do the special helicopters of the Russian army in Vietnam ????????? After the war? 7. first scene when he entered the Vietnam camp ... his first idea was to release the shelter that stands on the tree in the open space 'wow, what an idea more than again: 1. with the knife u can cut the iron cable? maybe only made in vietnam? 2. Mortar - using to hit a running man? My God, Americans really need to learn about weapons! Do you know how much is needed to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer has been watching many World War II films)?
