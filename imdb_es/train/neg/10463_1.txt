This movie had a lot of promise. I was very excited with this movie. In the end, it was laughable at best, painful in the worst case. The acting styles ranged from reality, reality, the plain (angels, wife and daughter) to excessive animation (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene regarding "the error". It is almost an insult to the ability of the audience to solve things. In defense of that scene, however, he had the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I had read that they spent a lot of money traveling to various places abroad. Too bad they did not use it. I did not feel that I was transported to exotic places. Anyone could insert archival images of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to finish on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were shown on the decoding computers. It's my opinion (and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much lower and the ACTION factor would have increased a lot, this movie would have been good.
