This movie was an attempt to go to places where most do not and perhaps should not venture. It was a similar test in the strange perspective of the main case that was given to us in The Cell, although not as close as in depth and well represented. The plot is simply constructed with an initial campy feel to it. Then, as the film takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot collapses into the few legs in which it had to stop in the first place. <br /> <br /> Basically, the idea is that of a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He assumes the role of hit man, killing an accountant in the city. Then they do not pay him for his work, but they torture him for several days because he came up with the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file that he had to take advantage of the payment. This idiotic move to try to force them to pay him back, as it is the object of horrible and endless abuse. Begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he has paid for his sins and can start again, he visits the wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and wins his affections. Soon after, she discovers who he is, tragedy attacks and revenge sweeps the air as the boy pursues his tormentors (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for his former "goodness". <br /> <br /> I However, I have to ask, what about Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore movies? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything he has published lately has been in this genre. Of course, I liked it in "Eight-legged Freaks" and it was fine in "Anaconda". But despite all its obvious appeal and charm (wow, she's sexy!), You can act much better and choose better roles. Or maybe, I'm wrong and that's just a misunderstanding. For all those who are out there, they can see their "monty completely" in this movie, although it is quite strange and short-lived. I almost felt that he did a bit of soft porn after watching this movie (something that is not alien to Kari's career). The sexual simulation is such that it makes you wonder what things really happen during filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll say there's some good acting. Just do not expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems destined forever to that of his brother Alex. However, the film brought out some of the great greats, George Wendt (Norm of Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job in playing the lead character, Sean Crawley. His small experience as an actor and, nevertheless, his credible nature as a naive young man, contribute some elements of substance to the film. <br /> <br /> I would not go out of my way for this. If you're bored and you're tired of the old episodes of "The Hitchhiker," then I might recommend seeing this. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start acting in some better movies!
