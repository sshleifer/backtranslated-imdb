2 stars out of 10 possible, and that is being too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas. How could it? miss me I was wrong <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard took on the weekend that he prepared this piece of pot. He had suspected for a long time that Sam S. was a kind of crazy, this film, based on his work, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artistic art b.s. that the actors LOVE to sink their teeth as it gives them the opportunity to move without ceasing. However, for the viewer who sits through this meaningless crap, there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this group. Pa is crazy, mom is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, yes, crazy. They also have a mouth that says words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot - and this is Delgado, you can read it carefully: it has a hole the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Ma is conspiring to sell her destroyed farm. It turns out that Pa is too. Now I do not pretend to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, the jointly owned property must have the signatures of the two owners to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, the other could not sell it legally, so it would not make sense for that person to do it. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and, therefore, his plan does not work. <br /> <br /> It's not like anything else is really working anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason why someone could What I have to see this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone would want to do it.
