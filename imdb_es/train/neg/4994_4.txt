Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for that. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, not just think about the action when I saw this. It started off well and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. Well, in the end the movie lost its credibility. The plot was not so cheesy at all, the action was not too special, but overall it was good, the performance was good, so more than enough to meet my needs. But everything was ruined because things happened that were above, and I left a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort into making everything credible and had gotten a 7 in the category of "do not think simply in action". So, in conclusion, if you know that you will get irritated because things are going on that seem completely illogical: do not look! otherwise I would say forward ...
