Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... Honestly, I must say that I have been disappointed in general throughout this series ("He never dies", "Siren in a well of visit" and "Flower of flesh and leathers "The blood" are the exceptions ... and even those are not great in any way ...), but the "Devil's Experiment" are simply punches.There is nothing realistic about it, apart from the poignant scene of the eyeball (or maybe anti-climatic, depending on how you see it.) The victim does not seem to really worry about what is happening and barely complains or moans while being subjected to "frightening" (more often "hilarious") torture "The flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and bloody representation of the false "tobacco" material, but that film also falls flat on the level of realism, I applaud the Japanese for pushing the limits, and they have really I've come a long way in the last 2 decades to wear the crown on the river Realization of "extreme" movies, but "Devil's Experiment" simply does not resist. It's worth checking out if you're a fan, if only to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this movie a generous 3/10 and that's just for the needle through the eye. scene...
