Again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and the Thunderbirds, a television series turns into a long-running movie and ruins all the hundreds of people they saw. Basically, Duke's cousins ​​Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County spend a lot of time driving very fast on "The General Lee." But they need to act together and prevent their family farm from being destroyed along with almost the entire city by the unsavory Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (nominated by Razzie Burt Reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (nominated for Razzie Jessica Simpson) and her uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being chased by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (M.C. Gainey of Lost) and police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of a couple of awesome car stunts, and of course Simpson's beautiful body (I'll admit that his legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but still! ), But besides that, it's pretty boring. He was nominated for Razzies for Worst Movie, Worst Director by Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst remake or sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Simpson and his "Daisy Dukes" and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor
