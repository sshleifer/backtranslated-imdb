I'm a very politically correct guy, so when I say sexist I really mean that it reduced the advantage of the guests, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. despite all its supposed brilliance and self-control, nothing more inside than an unreasonable big and jealous baby. Soon you have the plot, after your technical partner Marvik, also a rejected lover, vanishes when he tried to kill the Medusans. , Ambassador Kollos, for a jealous fury, but first he glimpsed it. (You think he could have entered the room with his eyes closed and removed the box, too easy) takes the Enterprise to an inescapable space outside the galaxy before the boys can subdue it. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that time they could have gone to see the doctor of a good lady and discuss it. "Spock has to make a mental fusion with the Medusan so we can get home, I mean, do you want to drift until we run out of supplies and die?" But the Star Trek royal lady is a jealous monster who complains and laments when the idea comes to her, even when her idol of Medusan told her to shut up and accompany them. So the beetch, despite grudges, messes with the fused Spock, which makes him forget to put on the visor, which makes Spock go crazy. Kirk, of course, discovered that she was a total imbecile and embarrassed her to fix Spock with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end the Lady and Medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost wish that the president of Battle Star Galactica has appeared to expel the witch from an air hatch for his destructive trick. But in the land of Star Trek, women are allowed to be totally unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time there is supposed to be sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
