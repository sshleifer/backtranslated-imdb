Well, where do you start here? Straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma. If this film had left Italy in, say, 1975, directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starring David Hess, then it would be consuming faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has produced an image of his own rape / revenge assault house in England, and apparently with the same budget that would have cost Rodriguez to convert the Rose McGowan's leg in a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, then let me say the "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. The rich and high-flying career woman meets a bit of roughness from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible way and, equally improbably, falls in love with him. Check <br /> <br /> 2. Free photos of said high-flying career woman in various states of nudity. Check <br /> <br /> 3. Development of complicated and highly improbable plot that configures characters that exist only to do what they do and that can not be imagined to have existence outside the scenes in which they are. Verify <br /> <br /> 4. An unnecessarily graphic scene of rape perpetrated by a gang of men without a personality depth or perceptible background other than rape. Check <br /> <br /> 5. Sandy and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to finish everything. Bingo! <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, Straightheads is pretty basic: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party on a field pile owned by his boss. On the way home, they upset three locals in a Landover who took revenge by giving Dyer a good shoe and raping Anderson. The couple then set out to avenge themselves. Until now, "Straw Dogs", "Night Trains", "House on the edge of the park", "I spit on your grave", etc. So, why did not I think much about this movie? A number of reasons: first, I suppose having Gillian Anderson in the prima facie cast leads me to expect something better, but it is the complete lack of honesty that irritates me the most. <br /> <br /> Because whenever someone sits down to see Hess and his illusions terrorizing women and murdering his men in those periods of the 70s, and then they always know exactly what they are getting: Quick, low budget budgets designed solely to impact and attract the lowest common denominator. The bad terrorize and kill the good, the good turn the tables to the bad and kill them, and everyone goes home satisfied, their desire to see some unpleasant violence dull and secure knowing that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, as writer and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads has much more to say about the state of the human psyche than that, and desperately tries to embed his film with a philosophical depth that simply does not exist. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan to take revenge on their attackers, they discover that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is the object of lust for the two men she walks with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction for his two companions to take away his daughter's attention. The casual and bold way in which Reed drops this little revelation in the plot is simply amazing, it's almost as if he expected this simple reference to pedophilia to be enough to shoot the public's moral compass and make them leave the cinema thinking that I'm just to sit through something of importance. To make sure we understand, at this point we are shown a sequence of rape for the second time, apparently on the part of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed makes sure we have many more shots. of Anderson mistreated and raped through the hood of his car. Gratuitous does not enter it. <br /> <br /> After being informed of the reasons for her rape, Anderson tied him on a table, rammed the business of a sniper rifle (complete with a bulky muffler, in case there was no one ). The phallic images are not clarified), but he does not have the courage to pull the trigger, and he tells Dyer (who has no such moral qualms) that "it's over." Dyer argues otherwise and his moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms in Cambridge with tea and cakes. It is almost incomprehensible in its ridiculousness. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Mrs. Anderson acts unexpectedly throughout the film. It is obvious that he wants to leave Scully far behind and, bless her, he certainly does; One wonders what Mulder would have done from his old crouching partner to take a leak on the side of the road and then sodomize a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he has done in virtually every film he has done to date, that is, he plays a kind of fashionable character with a mischievous smile, a cheeky line and a face that most of the people would never see. Tired of drilling. This is particularly true in the final scene, where, after assassinating his attackers in cold blood, Dyer looks at the camera, which I am sure must be, a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathize with the hand that has destiny. I confronted him and the moral dilemmas he had to overcome, but instead remembers Oliver Hardy much more, looking exasperated at the camera after Stan has taken him to another new disaster. Which by the way, sums up this movie very well.
