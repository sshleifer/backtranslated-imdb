Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and "Black Gold" was one, (the other was also 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence, but this was a good boy playing. Obviously, it was quite popular in the "fast" circuit, it made so many movies. In this, he plays the son of an old oilman who is convinced that he will soon discover oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell himself, since he knows that at any moment there will be oil. Henry, a geologist, appears on the scene and helps the father of "Fishtail's". He also convinces "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia, the cute teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film: she had started her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). The father of "Fishtail" is killed when the platform is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his friends to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. Everything ends well with the impact of oil and the "fish tail" to go to military school. <br /> <br /> It's fine for a rainy day.
