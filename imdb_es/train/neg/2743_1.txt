I must admit that I did not finish this film because it was incredibly stupid and not worth seeing. I saw him with a room full of children, who were not laughing at the stupid and raw humor either. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with the sphincters and genitals that it nullifies the true story with which I grew up. THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is stupid, has a bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and you loved it, then do not waste your time watching a movie that spoils it so much that it angers you. Buy the book to your children.
