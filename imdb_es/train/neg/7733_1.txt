What a disgrace! I was reviewing this in the hope that it was an undiscovered James Garner gem and how stinky it turned out to be! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undeniably scarce and I can honestly say that I am only a couple of hours older and much more stupid now. The film really did not have redeeming qualities and if this kind of thing keeps showing up, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it's about, it's not about anything, and in this case, it's not a good thing. We are subject to observing a bad-tempered old woman who is one of the dumbest creatures to roam the earth, married to a true love who is probably the only living person who could stand her. She drags him through one mess after another, puts him in one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! It's not worth the time it would take to see it, so do yourself a favor and skip this, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this is.
