I bought this movie for $ 5 at a bargain in my local video store for one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have shredded all five, tossed them into a toilet and thrown them away. The film is about a group of twenty-somethings who reached their peak in high school and met on the anniversary of the death of their idiot friends, who got drunk and wandered through the forest and died. The problem is that a reptilian monster is hunting them one by one. The acting is abysmal, these worthless people were apparently rejected in programs like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The address was on par with a twelve-year-old boy and the script was probably made by a thirteen-year-old boy. The whole set resembles someone's backyard in Malibu. The people here who have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at ALL costs.
