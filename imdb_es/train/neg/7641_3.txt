This is one of those movies that tries to be moody and tense, and instead ends up stumbling on its own. After having seen him at a queer film festival, I was intrigued by the writing of "the trio of young university students who went wrong", however, in general he ended up disappointed. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to criticize a "true story" as there is not much that can be done about the plot, but I found this disjointed, melodramatic and totally depressing. It's dark and almost sinister, painting a spooky flash of the seventies with stunning music and abrupt close-ups. It just does not work: some scenes so cheesy that, instead of a silent amazement, my audience was suppressing giggles and rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting premise, but this simply turns down into a dark, miserable spiral.
