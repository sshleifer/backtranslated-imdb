Okay, I'll admit it, it started very nice and good, but then it fell downhill, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could have finished reading the script after 5 minutes of entering the movie, the only reason why I I sat through everything. movie, I wanted to see the turn in the Ned, and to my surprise, well, friends, I can not even tell you if there was one, because the ending simply leaves you confused, and then the credit paper, it was like what the hell? This did not deserve a theatrical career, I'm sorry, but I do not mean that it was horrible, the only fact that I gave it a 4 is because it had some outstanding parts ... that's it! You can see it, I'm not telling you not to do it, I hope you like it or even love it! But if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
