This is one of those movies that apparently tried to ride the fashion of martial arts. Something like Billy Jack, I suppose. However, while Billy Jack had a remarkable scene of martial arts, there is none in this, unless you consider a game of knights and assaults as such. We are introduced to the star described as having learned Judo in the Marines. I was in the marines and, although they are pretty established in boxing, I really do not remember any emphasis on judo. As a result, the antagonist, James Macarthur, refers to Judo when he offers an excuse to explain why he, a champion wrestler of the state was so easily defeated. Lame.
