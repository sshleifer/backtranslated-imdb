I saw this movie several times and all I can say is that it is a low-budget garbage and that it has nothing to do with real historical events. The performance of the actors is very poor, but it is the result of limited possibilities of action. Anyone who has seen this movie now probably thinks of Hitler as a crazy madman who runs with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is well below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall in which you can see a brilliant performance by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
