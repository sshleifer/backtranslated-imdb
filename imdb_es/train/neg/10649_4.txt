Johnny Weissmuller's latest film as 'The King of the Jungle', after 16 years in the role, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, will disappoint everyone except the hottest of his followers. At 44, the former Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active "party animals," had outgrown the slender athleticism of his youth and looked tired (though he was in slightly better condition than his previous entry, TARZAN AND EL. HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Not only Weissmuller had aged too much for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the "child" par excellence, had reached adulthood (he was a 17-year-old), so he was removed from the script, under the pretext of being "absent from school". Brenda Joyce, at age 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as "Jane" (she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949 "THE MAGICAL SOURCE OF TARZAN") and was still as sexy as ever . <Br /> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, in RKO, with a minuscule budget, the cast and crew took advantage of the cheapest workforce when filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly the darkest of Africa, veteran director Robert Florey used the country extensively, incorporating the cliff and an Aztec temple in history. <br /> <br /> When a young Islander girl (Tyrone Power's future girlfriend, Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan, and learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the harder cinema villains) had practically enslaved the local population, threatening to take revenge on a living "God" if They did not fulfill their orders. The girl had been chosen to become the bride of "God", so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a silly plot or WHAT?', The girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island, and Tarzan, followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (played charmingly by John Laurenz, who sings several songs), and a government commissioner addresses the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the 'God' is simply a scammer with an Aztec mask, working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds), a bit of fighting action, and comedic relief and songs of Benjy, everything comes to the expected happy conclusion. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS presents a musical score by the brilliant film composer, Dimitri Tiomkin, and is much better than you would expect from this 'B' movie! <br /> <br /> While the film would provide an unusually auspicious ending to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variation of ape man, in kakis), the talent involved He raised the general product at least a little above the total mess that could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was about to recover and become much sexier ...
