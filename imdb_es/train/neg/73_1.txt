This has to be the worst garbage I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Is Heath Ledger a gallant? It looked deformed. I wish I had known that he and Naomi Watts are an article in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Is Orlando Bloom a gallant? With the scruffy beard and the look of deer in the headlights around him, I can not say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush seemed unable to. Wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Am I supposed to feel sorry for bankers and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually an entertaining movie. This was trite, clich√© and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced that it would improve. It was not so. <br /> <br /> The last 10 to 15 minutes or so were hilariously graceless. Heath and his gang are housed in a frontier hotel, and women and children die because of their presence. That is not fun. But it was fun when they left the hotel with their armor on, because all we could think about was the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say "I'll bite your leg!" We laughed out loud, as did other distorted members of the audience. When we left, almost everyone talked about what was a waste of time in this movie. <br /> <br /> You may not have paid in cash to see this disaster (preview), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never go back.
