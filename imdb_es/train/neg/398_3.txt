Come on guys, some previous critics have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old TV show from the 60s! This episode of Star Trek is notable for the most serious baby (that of Yeoman Barrow) used in Star Trek and for the fact that it was filmed in a real open-air location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, which were totally confined to the sound stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an outdoor location (and baby) provides an adequate depth and almost cinematic quality to a fairly common episode of this now dated and a very familiar program. <br /> <br /> Except for some notable exceptions, such as "The city on the verge of eternity", "The allocation of the Earth" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday". The old Star Trek series must be very serious. -booted and taken out of his boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 is a pretty low batting average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring things that Gene Roddenberry actually produced back then, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the terrain on which he walked, he actually did A LOT of rubbish! It does not deserve to be mentioned in the same way as Irwin Allen, for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the whole bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used staggering plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard on the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! All expenses saved or what!
