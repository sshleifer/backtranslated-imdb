Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (apart from SRK, of course, even though he does not manage to save the film), and it does not make much sense. The director makes everything seem very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make everything look very surreal, and yet credible. Well, he does not handle any. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not watch this movie, please! (Say this for your own well-being!) Keep looking, you'll find something else to see!
