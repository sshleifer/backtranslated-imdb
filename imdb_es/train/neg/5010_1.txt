Do not waste your time or money on this. The half decent cast can make you believe that this teen thriller, although it is not about to break any record, can entertain you slightly for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It will not. <br /> <br /> It will not scare you, laugh, cry or challenge your intellect. It will leave you wondering how this movie ended its production. Yes, it really is so poor.
