Creep - "Your trip ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's all for this movie. <br /> <br /> Without real argument, without argument. There are no nice characters, well, the 'characters' are not correct, considering that you do not have an idea of ​​who someone really is. I mean, they're being chased by some weird-looking "thing" in the sewers (who's this thing, why is it there?), That's pretty scary, I guess, but do I really care? No I do not. Why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I should want them to live or die. It is one-dimensional and is based on gore and sound effects to scare you, which rarely does. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning or purpose. It feels like I'm falling asleep and I missed the 45min accumulation. Jump straight to the action Basically, some women and their friends shut themselves up in the London Underground, are chased by a strange creature and then escape from it. <br /> <br /> The creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are fine, but that is not what makes a decent horror movie, so Unfortunately, all that is wasted. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another modern and predictable 'horror', where Kate (the main character) constantly makes the stupid "hey, I know that many sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! I'm going to do the opposite because I'm a silly blonde "thing." I wish they would not do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and it becomes predictable.In fact, I'm pretty upset that the dumb woman has not been stabbed by the gray creature with the extraterrestrial aspect. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the phrase from the movie Well, Creeps' journey ends only at a moment in the movie, if you've had a few beers, you have a couple of companions yours, of course, look at it by all means, but if you want something original and intelligent, avoid it.
