Marie Dressler publishes this Depression-era drama about a gracious bank owner, which recently aired on TCM during the month of the April Fools comedy. If you come with the expectation of great laughs courtesy of the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as this is really a very sad movie. It is also very badly done, surprisingly, considering that it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's photograph is strictly of the school of 'setting up the camera and not moving it', often to the detriment of the cast, who are delivering lines off the screen (it's like a copy and scanned before it existed!) or they have cut off their heads. The film does not even have an accredited director, underlying the apparent nature of the Fly by Night production. In general, it is an unsatisfactory disaster, with Dressler frequently over emotional and only that strange final reel to the bathroom to differentiate it.
