Pretty silly attempt of a mystery thriller of Hitchcock type, exchanging improbably espionage by archeology and based on the novel Robin Cook; By the way, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work, COMA (1978), in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, the director Schaffner had just done THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978), an equally capricious but much more fascinating jockstrap and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his so impressive career would not recover. <br /> <br /> However, despite its reasonably decent reach and cast, this turned out to be a critical and commercial failure, mainly because the narrative is not very exciting: in fact, it is quite sad (weak attempts at horror: the heroine archaeologist has to endure the burial, decomposing corpses in abundance, and even an attack by a flurry of bats (nonetheless). Lesley Anne-Down is the charming protagonist, who finds a lost treasure: actually a local sect has hidden it to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture).) for too long. Sir John Gielgud appears ungrateful from the beginning as the antiquities dealer who puts in the way of the spoils and pays this "act of betrayal" with his life. <br /> <br /> It usually happens that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be, so that apparent allies (like Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella , whom I saw in London at the beginning of 2007 in a West End presentation of "Frost / Nixon", which has now become a movie, passes from the antagonist of Down to his lover and reappears, as he decides to keep the wealth of the Egyptian high priest Menephta as a national treasure.
