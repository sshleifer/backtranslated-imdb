Very bad. Why someone thinks this is a good movie and much less funny is a real mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I LOVED "A Christmas Story". The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same memories of the writers has completely surprised me why this film is such a complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is unfortunately bad as the father to begin with. On the other hand, it does not seem to have the same rhythm, it just does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that permeated the first movie is completely absent here, you just want the movie to end. I would not even recommend this movie to the curiosity seekers who enjoyed "A Christmas Story". It's so bad 1/10.
