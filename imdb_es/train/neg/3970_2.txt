['Good. Look, I&#39;ve seen MANY and I mean MANY of this kind of movies. You know, those where the DVD cover looks so good and scary that you can not WAIT to see it? Well, I have GOT again. And I&#39;m getting pretty tired of that. But I digress. It&#39;s pretty simple It stunk (I know, quite young) but it did. And I&#39;m so much in agreement with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing, why, oh, why does the lead actress have to be so unattractive? In a distracted way, if I can add. And the gesture he used to convey the unresolved pain / pain over the death of his daughter did not help. I mean, Jesus ... Oh, but the demon thing crawling on his back was pretty clean ...']
