Django's ballad is a disaster of a movie! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from others (and much better!) Films supposedly linked by "Django" that tell how he brought different outlaws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) contributes nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one, unless you HAVE TO do all the Django movies and even THAT can not be a good excuse to see this one !!
