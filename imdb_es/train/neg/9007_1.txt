This movie is one of the worst things I've seen in my life. I literally have a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was horrible, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-out-out-something, except that it seems he can not work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the split-screen camera work. I felt I was seeing the Brady Bunch or something, just that there were not different people in the boxes, only close-ups and different views of the same thing. I can only imagine that the actors really needed the money, because this movie was not worth it for the film in which it was filmed.
