I have no idea what fools gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was outrageous! In fact, I saw everything simply because I could not believe that someone would make such a useless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters lack depth and there is no attempt to give any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to lose 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure you bring something to shoot because the cinematography is just someone running with a handheld camcorder and half the time you can not even. See the main topics This style has been used with much more success in films like "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot or suspense to which that style can lend anything. I should have known better when it arrived at 2 in the morning that it was going to be horrible.
