I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! This will be great!" I was so wrong The story was all fucked up. In fact I still do not understand it. It seems to me that all the characters they did were drinking, smoking (opium?) And having sex. It's not that those are not good cinematographic qualities, but please! Where was the story? I had the movie finished, and yes, it got to the end, but by then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want it. Just do not trust the bottom of the box.
