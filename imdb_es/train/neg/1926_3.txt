Having been forced by my children to see this at least 10 times in each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel properly qualified to judge this version of Dr. Seuss's classic story, and well ... it's not very good. First of all, following a classic character like Chuck Jones' animated television special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so hard and padded to be really numb. I will admit that there are a handful of inspired gags, but in general, the film is presented as a calculated cash robbery, at the same time that it is supposedly denouncing the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually at the top, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As Boris Karloff characterized it, it was a slow burn; Methodical and cunning. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and that is just the most obvious mistake made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will assume almost any role offered (like his compatriot Michael Caine), but this must be presented under "Movies that should never have been made". This is not a good omen for Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I'm going to make the same recommendation for the one I'm with this one: skip it, and read the book or watch the special television. This is 2 hours you can never go back.
