Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not see it until the end ... It's a pure waste of time ... I really feel sorry for Snipes for having finished up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should not be. Just to tell you a scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting inside the building, but they are still whispering so that Snipes does not suspect anything.
