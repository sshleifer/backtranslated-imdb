I have heard about this movie for many years and finally I had the opportunity to see it. A mass murder of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 eventually caused the closure of a cheerleading camp. Moving on to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens it up with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are killed by the murderer, until there is only one left. That is when we discover who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the film are Tom Smothers doing a terrible accent like a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens doing his Pee-Wee Herman exercises. The plot in general is not very developed and it is quite boring, but some funny scenes do happen, like the House of the Bad Feet and the scene of the strip poker. The end seems to have been thrown together, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> In general, good for a total of ten or fifteen minutes, the rest can advance quickly. Maybe I catch him on TV, but it's not worth buying.
