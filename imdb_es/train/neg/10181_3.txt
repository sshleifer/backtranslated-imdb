This movie is so bad that it's funny. It's led by Scott Backula as a coach, but that's not important, the important thing is the great black player who plays at first base. First, he must be at least 75 years old, but he still plays baseball in the minor leagues, and second, he starts the movie in the gardens despite not being able to walk, much less run. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly to first cite the fact that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows a brighter coaching strategy at the end of the movie, (SPOILER), tells his star player "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly that "downtown" saw this as a good move. He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league team that played with the Twins that were the class of the majors in the film. Now, if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, was a coach as smart as Backula and told his players to just hit a home run every turn at bat, the Royals would never finish an inning and much less lose a game.
