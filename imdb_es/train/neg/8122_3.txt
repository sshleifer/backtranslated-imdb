Painful to see, and not at all for the empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia, the mother and Monica, the well-known daughter, spend most of the film kicking meowing and with bitterness, respectively. His characters are so firmly established that his redemption in tolerable personalities after a rapid family catharsis is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I wish a worthy launch of honesty between families would be less painful to watch.
