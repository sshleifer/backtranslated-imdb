I do not see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be science fiction). It's really "let's see what soap is operationally active this week" and, oh, the Cylons are involved through flashbacks. <br /> <br /> The Cylon "baby" that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty scarce, it's pretty obvious that T & A was added to the show. Every time it appears, I'm baffled that WTF is supposed to be happening. And do not even try to insult me ​​with the "arcs of history." <br /> <br /> It's a telenovela with some CGI incorporated. This is not science fiction, apart from the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that is intended. If you like modern camera work, avant-garde, risky, lazy, lazy editor in crack, this show may be for you. Since the nerds seem to be enthusiastic about this program, it is a clear indication that the opinions of vocal nerds have changed since Picard's TNG.
