Spoiler down, but keep reading or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all plans to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night, in a remote research lab, it's an important medical breakthrough. To have deadly results. A chemical compound that was created to "hunt down and destroy" deadly cancer cells leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system to the basement of the building. Now, the rodents involved in the above laboratory experiment are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading biological researcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now allows its "hunting and destruction" formula to regenerate for the time necessary to neutralize deadly cancerous tumors. When three different grades of the new mix are administered to three different rats and the rest is poured into the defective "Waste Waste" sink, the shocking side effects result in a night of terror ..... right ... < br /> <br /> Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. All about it screams "Under budget!", From the horrific acts to the special effects that are some of the worst I've seen. The characters are imbeciles and act in a stupid and predictable way: they walk through dark corridors alone, look for a cat, stumble and fall so that the "rats" can reach them, climb into a small room, etc. <br /> <br /> While some movies are made at low cost, this movie really takes the cake. All the possible corners are cut, everything from reusing previous shots, filming the corridors of the "Laboratory" from different angles to make it look bigger (That reminds me, why only TWO guys worked in this damn massive building?!? !?!?), music and special effects that could be done on a workshop PC for children. <br /> <br /> That brings me to the worst aspect of this pile of steaming manure: special effects. Only horrible. Computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene, so even the most enthusiastic of the movies could see that they are computer generated. And that giant rat costume - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, are we supposed to believe that the damn beany baby is a monster? Simply unfortunate ........ On the positive side, some of the gore look very good, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> All the actors suck. No one involved in the production was concerned or knew what they were doing. I've wasted a lot of time with the review, just follow my advice, it's garbage. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transfer sucks, the audio is passable and there is a track of comments on the disc of the director and two of his friends, who say that they have absolutely nothing to do with Making the movie but they were there to ask questions and make comments. These three subhuman primordial slimes are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I do not want to lose more of your kind reader or mine, because I'm starting to remember more of what I want about this movie ... DVD rating: 1/10.
