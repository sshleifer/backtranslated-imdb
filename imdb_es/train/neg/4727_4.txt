This movie is really a kind of healing egg, good in parts. In contrast to other reviewers, I found that the main flaw is their inability to attract the interest of the viewer in the characters and the plot. I sat through it because I was interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of the bands, but if I evaluated it simply because of its merit as a film, I would have to approve it, with some warnings: Jason Behr is good in John's part Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; The narrative about the trauma of his childhood is not clear, although we are given clues about Livien's well-acted relationship with his parents, but his behavior is, ultimately, strange to the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using a scenic person to solve internal conflicts is interesting, although it is not a novel nor is it fully explored as a theme in this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I confess that I am not a fan of the Beatles. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derived from them. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way it opened with some interesting philosophical reflections from the main character, although they left the threads of their thought there, only to pick them up in the middle of the film very briefly, when Livien says, "before God , there was music "(did you ever see that announcement by Tia Maria in the 1990s," Before time, was Tia Maria? "That's what came to mind anyway); It seems like an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he did it, but he has a right to it. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, skillfully played by Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the fallacy of this thought when he replies "You do not know." <br /> <br /> In general, the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go in any direction in future projects, in a meaningless banality or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
