SCARECROWS seems to be a supernatural horror movie and failed. A group of thugs carried out a paramilitary robbery of the payroll at Camp Pendleton in California. They stole a cargo plane that kidnapped the pilot and his daughter with demands to fly to Mexico. Along the way, a greedy thief decides to rescue with the money that lands in a field of corn guarded by strange-looking scarecrows. These are not just ordinary scarecrows ... they can kill. The performance is not better than the horrible dialogue. And the humorous attempts are not funny. Budget very low and filmed completely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
