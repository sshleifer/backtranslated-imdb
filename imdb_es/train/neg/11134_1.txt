This is a very cheap werewolf movie. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is uneven and is badly recorded and mixed. The script is a clich√© full of trash with the usual characters, like the tough detective who shoots the werewolves with his silver pistol. [Full, of course, with silver bullets]. The acting is as wooden as the characters. The effects are non-existent, many extreme approaches of jaws and bites of werewolves. The only thing that is shown is a bunch of soft core T & A. Instead of losing $ 30 for this gut, check out an excellent picture of a recent werewolf: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
