From what I can tell you, despite previous comments posted by other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. I found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I paid the total of 98 cents plus taxes for it. I found it in a 98-cent store between plastic racks and disposable toothpicks. Now, is not that how the people who paid beau coup bucks for the super limited edition Swedish import version of super duper? I thought that if. <br /> <br /> This movie was worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I could start arguing with you. But it's clearly worth 98 cents. And remember what you said about getting what you pay for. For the experts of the Slasher movie only.
