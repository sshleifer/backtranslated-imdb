Since this film was made in less than a year, it could explain its lack (81 minutes, including the final credits, approximately 76 minutes of the real movie). But what he can not explain is the lack of humor that the previous movie possessed. <br /> <br /> The gags are fast and, sometimes, not even funny. The only fun parts are the quick parodies at the Nike basketball venues, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and fragments scattered throughout the film. Very little fun was the takeoff of Charlie's Angels, which like the first spin-off scene of The Scary Movie and Matrix, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it. <br /> <br /> It is possible that young people today can not relate. to the false jokes of the classic supernatural horror movies of the 70s, like Exorcist and perhaps of the 80 'Poltergeist, et. to the. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Scary Movie 3 takes a little while to arm itself, making the skits more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, however, the movie is more than the last of promising. The young actress Anna Faris (whom I must admit, seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just because of his casting and acting ability, I give this movie a "3" of "10".
