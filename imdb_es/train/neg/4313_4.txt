Like last year, I could not sit through the whole thing. Well, Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely interested. Or, rather, of all the total boredom in the theater, at least it was not in the Top 10 of the most boring. Many of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I did not know that everything had been done by autocue (although I knew it was written) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors can not insert the expression, they separate the sight of the signal and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman, if there is no director, it's gone). The night of the disguises and the boring speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles killed some good songs and there were very few speeches and decent acceptance clips. Adam Sandler wins the prize for the worst presenter. <br /> <br /> For helping me write this review, I would like to thank my mom, my dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for believing in me, and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism and, of course, I have not been starving for a month. I will not cry ... thanks.
