I still find it difficult to understand that a film as bad as what could be done in Hollywood. The acting and the story is just pathetic and the direction is horrible. I do not see any logic behind this crap, except that the director had nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. I was dismayed that I was going to waste more time of my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know in what category it falls. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even hit your head against the walls but do not go for this movie.
