0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good. The performance is among the worst I've seen, what is really amazing is that ALL are horrible, not just a few here and there, all. The direction is a joke, the low budget is irremediably evident, the score is horrible, I would not say that the film was edited, a more appropriate phrase would be brutally cut. Combine serial murders, voodoo and tarot cards. Silly. Silly. Silly. It is not scary at all, special effects are hopelessly scarce. ridiculously bad in everything. The writing was frightfully bad. The cinematography is really cheap and, at times, very grainy, and the camera work is terrible. Once again, what the film really does is how bad all the actors are. Cheesy.
