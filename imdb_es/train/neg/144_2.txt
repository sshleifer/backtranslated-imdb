There's no way to describe how really bad this movie is. It's a shame that I really sat through this movie, this very boring and predictable movie. What's wrong with it? Acting: There is not a single performance that is even remotely close to being below average (at least they are all very nice). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgy in the soundtrack, everyone will know they're watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. I do not even mean "What the hell?" Moments, here are some: the murderer can move at the speed of light: the door opens. The actress turns, there is no one there, she turns around, there is something sitting in front of her; Out of now where the killer appears with an electric drill, a really big one! The filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find the outlet to plug it in? I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I want to say "Where did you get the electric drill? I could go on talking about how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words, I will give this 2 out of ten stars. star for making me laugh and another star for all the neckline, seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
