I wanted to see it for two reasons. One, was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the part of Bogart was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with a certain subtlety, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot of Hig Sierra; only here, the actors do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer thought. Jack Palance is getting bored watching Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters wonders what he's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare it with Ida Lupino in the same paper. And of course, they had to use the dog's story again! Surely some different ideas could have arisen. Maybe the color makes it nice to see the same place where they filmed High Sierra, but that definitely does not add any quality to the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not watch a pseudo-film noir? As for me, I'd rather die than see it one more time ...
