A novel of remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A refugee from the left who struggles to remain in Paris between the wars. An undercover agent of the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> It's a shame there's no synergy here. The parts and pieces never come together. <br /> <br /> The stories about the left refugees in France do not have to be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoirs "Slag of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or its chilling "Dialogue with death" (idem). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details. <br /> <br /> Potential customers spend a lot of time drinking calvados, Norman apple brandy. I appreciate any suggestion of taking a slug of calvados myself. It certainly made this movie seem to go faster. But, according to the movie, it is only sold in cheap low class salons. Live le tabac parisien! That's what I said. References to intoxicating liquors abound here; That seems to be a concern of the writers. <br /> <br /> I like films that take place in France because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to appear on a wall as a backdrop. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This movie would have a score of 10 if we were only judging by the refinement of its alcohol murals. <br /> <br /> The indifferent score of the film is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is better known, if you can call him that, for his opera "The Emperor Jones," based on the work of O'Neill. It premiered at approximately the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two of Lawrence Tibbett. Although it should re-emerge soon; They are running out of potentially marketable operas to revive. <br /> <br /> Opera seems like an appropriate topic to mention here since the character of Charles Boyer operates under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both prominent roles in the German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The omission of names seems to be part of this movie. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss is one of the main characters of "All Quiet on the Western Front" of Remarque. <br /> <br /> Well, the jokes are in place; I guess there was not time to develop any drama.
