This is a bad version of the classic Parineeta de Bimalda. The story is based on the book of the same name by Sarat Chandra and is a distortion of the original. Well, one can appreciate a certain degree of creativity but not simulate creativity. Everyone's performance is affected and the whole movie is a farce. The choice of the words of Shekar's father to abuse Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) hits Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the film and the characters, it is quite jarring for the senses and could have been easily avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unlike the movie and a cheap trick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is pretty good. Another positive point in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif defends himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive deviation from the original and deserves credit. In these accounts this movie deserves 3 stars. Rekha's song and dance smell like artifice and it's a show. The song is melodious but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if I'm not mistaken, it seems that the melody has been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, he agreed that times have changed since then until now. But then this movie does not even reflect modern times. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers become increasingly obsessed with impressing NRIs and catching the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films belong neither to India nor to any other part of the world.
