If there was a scale below 1, you would get a -10, following the steps of Godspell. The performance (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, the plot in ruins. And Rene Russo was disgustingly sweet in his role, enough to make a person react. Ten thumbs down for a silly movie. The saving grace: congratulations for the period costumes.
