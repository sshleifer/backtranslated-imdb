An unpleasant woman and an equally nasty man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psychopaths during a nocturnal encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack against their attackers ... <br /> <br /> Completely voyeuristic garbage repellent piece, that somehow poses as a "provocative" drama of thoughts ", while in fact it is presented as sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you only know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been chosen if they had been made so easily in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is frightening and devastating, but Dan Reed, somehow, manages to rub the spectator's nose in every drop of his sexual evil. His camera remains hungry in Anderson's naked body during and after the assault, while the script leaves almost all the characters in a turgid sea of ​​two-dimensional cliché. His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to keep the viewer away from the "victims" by putting in his face more frightening situations (Adams attempts to attack Sophie and Alice after the incidents, Alice's attack on Heffer AFTER his suicide - I confess confession). <br /> <br /> The dilemma comes from the performances of the central characters: Dyer is a horrible actor, unable to be illuminated and shaded as the young victim of the initial assault (he will end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson it's extraordinary. Even though the atrocious script forces his character to behave in a depraved and ridiculous manner, it somehow offers an extraordinarily convincing and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent and arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs retaliation. <br /> <br /> A vile and useless movie then, almost but not completely rescued by a convincing central female performance.
