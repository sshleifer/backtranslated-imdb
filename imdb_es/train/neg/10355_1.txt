I have loved this book since my fifth grade teacher read it in our class many years ago. And I have read it in each of my 3rd and 5th grade classes during my last 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but he had never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were very excited when we found out that Disney had brought to the screen the excellent book by Madeline L'Engle. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, I had the highest hope. As the movie progressed, I felt increasingly dejected. They had spoiled it! I had never been so disappointed by a favorite adaptation from book to film. I understand that movies can not strictly follow a book, but they do not need to change things for the simple reason of doing it! Most, if not all, of the outputs of the book were totally unnecessary! <br /> <br /> At first I kept my opinion and only heard my students talk about the movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same way: deceived by the great story that Madeline L'Engle had created so skillfully! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why was Mrs. Which did not have the right "witch" attire that was such an intelligent game in her name? Basically, we all ask ourselves: why did almost all the details have to be changed? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed about the wonderful movie that this book would make. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take charge of the task!
