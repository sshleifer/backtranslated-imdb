I've seen bad movies in my time, but this really gets the cookie! Why, oh, why has this movie been made? There is simply nothing here at all. Please trust me, turn on the power switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... it may take about 5 minutes to appear in the camera. This is the key problem, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... whatever it is) in no way lends itself to being completed for 80 minutes. And therefore, we have to sit for more than an hour watching people walk. That's! In the whole first half hour, absolutely nothing happens, apart from seeing someone walking to a store ... and then 3 guys walking through a forest. Maybe this time could have been dedicated to the development of the character ... but no. And, therefore, there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, and when they start firing, we do not care about anything! In fact, in the end, I was in favor of the bad guys so that the film would end! Besides this, the work of the camera is really horrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West is trash. I hate hitting a boy, but really, his job is pants! These boring close-ups continually, and then long shots followed by people as they walk. I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists. How this man has been directed to direct the next film of cabin fever is something that surpasses me! To finish, the performance is also regrettable, ... which applies to the film as a whole. Keep your sanity, stay away from this pile of total excrement!
