Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who is blamed for the murder of the president of the United States. I will point out immediately that this is not the kind of role for which this talented actor is characterized, and this movie shows us why. He joins a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' can not get your attention, plain and simple; part of the action is good, the acting is not all bad and the story, although clich√© and done before, could have led to an entertaining and enjoyable movie: WELL IT DOES NOT! The writing of the script and the direction assure it absolutely, in no moment they will absorb it in the history nor they will make him think about any of the personages. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, Predictable and boring.
