Yes, the subject is a direct quote from the film and I think it is quite accurate. I was so bored to die with this useless effort. All the flashes, etc., that do not make sense after the first 20 minutes are just bad movies. + If you are epileptic, you would have already died at least five times. Of course, all the fans of David Lynch will raise a flag so that this type of turkey is "the best movie that has been made" because it does not make any sense And when it does not make any sense, it has to be art, and art The film always It's good Right? I say badly. This type of artificial art is just a pathetic way of trying to prove that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should continue acting.
