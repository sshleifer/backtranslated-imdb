The photograph on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen was dead. I think I missed seeing half the movie. Still, it was poorly done and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I expected a mystery or a thriller, but I did not get involved enough to worry after the first frames. I rented the film especially for Willem Dafoe and it saddened me that he wasted his talent. I do not think that Giada Colagrande has studied film making enough time to develop a great movie. She is attractive and could become an actress, but she took on too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced to the plot.
