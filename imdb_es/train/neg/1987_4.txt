This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful, but that's where it ends. It seemed that a mediocre Set It Off meets the West. The plot hardly made sense. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too many unnecessary things that were not related to the plot and did not help to advance the story either. There were also long blank moments in which the plot could be explored, but it was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense than the address. I had a big question mark in my head when I saw this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just looking for sweet eyes, this is the movie for you.
