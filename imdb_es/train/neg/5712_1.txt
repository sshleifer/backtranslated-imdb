After sitting in this pile of excrement, my husband and I wonder if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. He was so indifferent and formulated. But the propaganda of the United States thrown in your face throughout the film shows, in a disappointing way, that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, "We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage throws lines like "I never would." use the Declaration of Independence as a negotiation sheet "with a serious face made me and my husband ask us if the entire cast took Valium before filming each scene, the" reasoning "behind each plot turn and the new one" "It's really ridiculous and impossible to follow." And there's also an extra misogyny plot, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being reprimanded by everyone involved so that they "never shut up." He's clearly in the movie just for his appearance, but they felt the need to slap a "Dr." in his character to give him something serious.At a point, the character of Cage says: "You never shut up?" and the camera is approaching to her looking at her hands, as if she were a girl ... Truly grotesque ... The only benefit of this movie is that it's so surprisingly bad that you get some laughs ... The really scary thing is that most of the people who watched the movie with us pair They enjoy enjoying it. Horrifying....
