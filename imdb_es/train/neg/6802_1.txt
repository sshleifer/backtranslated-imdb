Words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain it only in writing. You also have to see it for yourself to understand how horrible a movie can be. It's not that I recommend you do that. There are so many clich√©s, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that will make you cry. To start with the technical first, there are MANY mistakes regarding the airplane. I will not list them here, I will only mention the color of the plane. They did not even manage to show a passenger plane in the colors of a fictitious airline, but they used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count very soon. Also, I was on the bad side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. The "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be a choice about this, even the "Turbulence" movies are better. In fact, any other movie in the world is better than this one.
