I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh hysterically at them. and the science fiction channel had a marathon of them, culminating in the premiere of their new original image, hammerhead: shark frenzy. Based on the previews, it looked like it was going to be VERY fun. Essentially a remake of the benchley creature, really. It was preceded by a shark attack demonstration 3: Megalodon, which is the hilarity of the shark movie at its best. I was in the mood. I was ready to go. Go ahead, hammer, crazy, scientist, man! Oh, God, that movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> this is the theoretical reproduction at its worst moment, my friends. when a drugged girl is taken from a suspended animation and tied to a table screaming her head because the human-shark hybrid fetus that the absolutely mad "scientist" implanted deliberately in her womb wants to leave ... monkeys of Jesus. that's what I call disturbing. <br /> <br /> that's how the plot works: hmmm, the mad scientist thought. My son died of cancer, but I gave him back his life by combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks do not succumb to cancer and other hammerheads reproduce through the placenta. Oh look! A perfect amphibious being! I have created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! Let's play it! But, damn it, if all those shark genes have not made my son thirsty for blood; Instead of raping the hot girls I keep sending to his little jungle paradise, he keeps eating with him. But look at this! Among the random people who, through an unimportant plot twist, ended up on my research island, is the woman my son was committed to before he died! I bet he will do it! all this leads to an extremely moving and sincere meeting: woman: will you impregnate me? crazy scientist: no. he is. (Indicates that you hit the shark person in the tank) How sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. forever.
