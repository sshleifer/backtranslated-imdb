Some nice landscapes, but the story itself, in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of doing Egyptian things in the least egiptological way (eg, flash photography in the tombs) . , the handling of the ancient parchment, etc.), discover a war of the territory of the black market and in some way (in the space of two days, nothing less!) becomes the epicenter of the dress of the war suit; . Down is just as horrible as the visiting British scholar (who seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and much less about antiquities is the writers' fault, but that is annoying because everything about them is their fault), and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as confused by the process as I was. In short, it is not what I would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and company. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching a ridiculously dated scene in which Down showers all male scholars, blaming them for her failure as an academic, while bathing in the softest light that Hollywood could muster. To top it off, he spends the next hour of the movie screaming, harassed and running into the arms of whatever kind he can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note for potential Egyptologists: take a year or two of Arabic at a graduate school. It will really help in the long term ...
