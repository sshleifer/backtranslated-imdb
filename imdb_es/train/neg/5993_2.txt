I grew up (No. 1965) observing and loving the Thunderbirds. All my classmates in the school watched. We play "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. The countdown of 5 became an art form. I took my children to see the film with the hope that they could glimpse what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the melody of the fast track. Not that it could be compared to the original score of the Thunderbirds. Fortunately, on Saturday mornings a television channel still plays replays of the series that Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should deliver his director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Absolute garbage. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing the puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a great error of judgment.
