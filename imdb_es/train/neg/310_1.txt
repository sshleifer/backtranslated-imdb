I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the wall in Blockbuster. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at that time, I rented it. HONESTLY I could only see about 30 minutes. That was terrible. Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the public's hands. Honestly, I hope this movie leaves soon, and I hope it stays that way.
