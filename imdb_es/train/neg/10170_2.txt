There are only a few days until the championship game, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be. From players with marital problems, drug overdoses, gambling problems, to a loose assassin, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable and wonderful time. Can you put things back in order and stop a murderer before the big game is ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you may think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plot device and a subsequent thought. Instead, Superdome is another one of those terrible telenovelas of the 70s, made for television and populated by Hollywood. The cast is numbed along the thing without anyone really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson, in a very small paper that seems lost in general why it is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting, and incredible. Donna Mills as a successful "man"? Yeah sure! It's as believable as the romance he has with David Jansen's soaked liquor. The movie also lacks rhythm. When trying to include the four or five story lines in the movie, whatever the flow the Superdome has had. Without drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very bad example of a movie made for the television of the 70s. The highlight for me was the work of the late Charlie Jones announcer, a sports commentator I miss listening. The eloquent way in which he exaggerates the intrigue and exaggerated the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most of the others who have seen the Superdome, I also did it courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of the beginning of the programs. So, although I have only rated Superdome in 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
