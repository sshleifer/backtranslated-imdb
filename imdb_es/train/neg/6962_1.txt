How could such good actors as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet have been involved in a ... a ... well, such a thing? I can not get it It was horrible, he played very bald (but some of the few leading roles), the jokes are silly and absolutely nothing funny ... I will not talk more about this movie, except for a little advice: Do not go see that, it will be a waste of time and money.
