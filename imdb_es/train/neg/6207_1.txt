This film commits what I would call an emotional violation in the viewer. The film supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics at Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt at a rookie director getting noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the subject of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis of the main character of a good but problematic child to the vicious rapist. it is virtually nonexistent, while the rape scene (which is an exaggerated and exaggerated version of the "Orange Clock" rape scene) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To finish: surprisingly brutal, disgusting and WILL NOT VALUE YOUR TIME. See "A mechanical orange" or "You pianiste" instead.
