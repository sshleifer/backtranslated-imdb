VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The plot is predictable, and it's REALLY corny, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes of the time are the only reason why Say the movie is one, apart from that ... this is definitely a movie that one can not afford to see ... It seems to me that while I watch the movie, the idea behind the film was interesting, although a kind of clich√© ... ... I bring the city bump blah blah blah, but I think it could have been at least a little better if it had not been so cheesy, very badly represented from the idea to the screen, I think. The plot is somewhat predictable at times, although the dance that I can say A TIME, is pretty good, the turn of the break dance battle was good ... IF you just do the movie and watch the dance scenes and create your own dialogue maybe it can be a 5 ... hahaha
