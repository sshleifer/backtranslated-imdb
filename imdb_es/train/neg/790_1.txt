This is what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The head of BBC3 needs to make programs aimed at different audiences for BBC1 and BBC2 to maintain the license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his unbridled friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The boss of BBC3 catches them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all is that, possibly, it is racist, like all the characters play with bad stereotypes. If a white person did this kind of thing, there would be an uproar! <br /> <br /> Garbage.
