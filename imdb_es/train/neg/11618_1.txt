The acting in the film is very well done honestly, but the film is very slow and boring, as soon as it becomes interesting, everything slows down. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, just like the other actors, as I mentioned, but man ... this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Now maybe in a short film this movie would be good, but apart from that, avoid it. This movie has so much filling that it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> Never, never, I leave the movies, but seeing this at home with my family, I left. Yes, it was so boring. Apparently my comment does not have enough lines to publish, so here is something more filling. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just saw.
