I am grateful for one thing and only for one thing: this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent! Hurrah!!! This program perfectly summed up how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with the prostitution of herself and her family in the media in the name of self-promotion and the "Beckham Brand". <br /> <br /> A few years ago I used to like 'Posh and Becks' a lot, I still admire David's talent a lot, but I do not have any respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand on his butt working like a puppet? <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was all about the premature departure of Beckham from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened. It happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that, although he may be making billions of pounds, he has sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team that will fight to get the promotion of Division One in England (no offense to the United States). - But in baseball and basketball you rule, football is not! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm rambling. It's been years since I've seen such an exaggerated and totally false performance of 'Posh', which has been surpassed only during its performances worthy of the red carpet after the 'debacle' of Rebecca Loos, when instead of throwing all the cr * P to David who deserved it, she clung desperately to his arm trying to save the million pounds of money her marriage has become. <br /> <br /> This whole public relations trick was pathetic. Why can not you go there quietly, support your husband in the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep his head down? When did it become so full of self-importance that you feel that moving to the United States should be wrapped up in this huge rate for fans? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he has retained a little grace and humility. Two things that his wife could do with learning. <br /> <br /> One more thing, Victoria: you complain that you are constantly harassed by the paps. Small clue: stop telling them your whereabouts, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America!
