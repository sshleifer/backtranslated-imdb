This movie looks like it was made for television. For years I waited for a film about Rubin Carter to be made, because I loved seeing it in old MSG, and watching this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but it was horrible and boring. There's nothing good to say about this movie, except that I liked the song.
