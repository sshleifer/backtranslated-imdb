What I think I'll probably like most about the new Star Wars movie, "Phantom Menace," is that it will probably get "Titanic" out of the water, if you forgive the pun, when it comes to a devastating box. office receipts, and therefore, eliminate it from the number one place. Every time I hear someone declare that "Titanic" is the best movie they've ever seen, I think, "You do not see many movies, right?" What a parody You could make 50 good movies that are much better than "Titanic", and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, he won many academic awards, a lot of people loved it," as Someone could say in his defense. Well, many people like Spice Girls and thousands and millions of people eat at McDonald's, but that does not mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans may be wrong. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype of the movie. I waited more or less a month to see it and, ultimately, it did not live up to the expectations placed on it, which simply drew more attention to the terribly stupid love story. It is true, "Phantom threat" will probably suffer a similar fate. but. <br /> <br /> The "Titanic" by James Cameron is. a) a cheesy action movie disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has its best moments in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something better for the documentalists, who would have enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that is up to the level shown with the real ship. f) a 3-hour theft that I will never recover, therefore, the greatest motivation for a time machine I can imagine. When I meet someone who has not seen him yet, I say: "I would like to be able to exchange places with you". g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can immerse themselves in ice water and still form intelligible sentences? h) Fortunately, a film that was not recognized for any performance achievement at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in the cinema, and little else. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I post this as an anonymous comment is that I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 13-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who will not hesitate to come to their defense, and I'm not really interested in hearing a defense of the history, performance or duration of Titanic.
