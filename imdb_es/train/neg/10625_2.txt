I am an 11th grade student in my high school. In my current World Affairs class, a child in my class had this video and suggested we see it. That's what we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon, since my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest piece of shit I've seen in my life, the boy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, did he have to show that JFK was shot? And how dare he use all those biblical quotes? The only good thing about this film is that it generates debates, which is good because in my class we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my opinion. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. The next film by Michael Moore could be called "A Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11th" or "A Funny Thing Happened on the Road to the White House".
