This is more or less a type of low budget film, made for television, destined to capitalize on the success of the original. I'm a fan of the B movies, and this could have been good if they had not assigned the name "Cube", because as they were, the director and the plot of the original were better, and this movie almost ruined me. the whole series. The characters are annoying and clich√©, there are problems with continuity and several production problems. History barely has a chance to develop due to a superfluous dialogue and suffers for that. More or less they use the same horror tricks again and again throughout the movie, and because the first one was so good, this simply turns out to be a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If this were an independent bonus b. Movie, I would probably give it about four. The grade of "1" I give him was more or less a statement about how he paled completely in effects and intelligence compared to the first.
