Ladies and gentlemen, do not be fooled by the label of the movie "A Stanley Kubrick". This is a very bad movie that, unfortunately, has been considered one of the deadliest horror films ever made. Horror films should create such a fear that at night people should shudder at the thought of a true horror movie. In Shining, there is no real horror, but what we find is just a naive and foolish attempt to create a chilling horror. Everyone knows how good the attempts are. They are if they are different from reality. All that is good in the movie is the view of the frozen valley. The hotel where most of the actors stayed also looks good. A word about actors Jack Nicholson seems like a lost and lazy soul who is never really sure what he is supposed to do. There is not much to say about a bald, colored actor who most of the time is busy pampering a child actor. It is not necessary to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. It can not be helped because the film was made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make changes.
