Van Dien must shrink from embarrassment at the memory of this ridiculously poor movie, as do all the individuals involved. To be honest, I am ashamed to admit that I saw it from beginning to end. The production values ​​are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five-year-olds could propose a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. As for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most absurd porn movie you've ever seen, one of those in which the action is completed with an endless 'story' to explain how an old pot of the old blonde peroxide kettle has come to be spit. - Roasted by a couple of guys with mustaches - you'll have an idea of ​​the performance standard in 'Maiden Voyage'. Worse yet, you can not even advance to sex scenes, because there are none. A frighteningly terrible movie.
