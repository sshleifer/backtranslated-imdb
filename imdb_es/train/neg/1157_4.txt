I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie based solely on the appearance of Snoop Dogg (a passionate fetish of them) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought that the film would include the typical set of behavior and images related to Snoop Dogg that are often seen in clich√© rap videos. However, my generalization was for the most part wrong. Unfortunately, this did not improve the movie. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the film as a dark and serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a seriously drawn boring drama movie. The film tells the story of two writers with difficulties (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who try to create their own masterpieces. Their opposite polar lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film like a wild rollercoaster, most of which is contributed by the character of Snoop, which reminds one with a serious case of split personality disorder. And although the film is a drama, the performance, which has a morbid and serious tone, Snoop and company was more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie for those who are attentive. deteriorated because this has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even for the most part they are stuck with more dialogue. The ending, however, jumped towards me with a sudden surprise. It was a little twisted, something unexpected and a perfect way to finish a movie that needed to end. While watching the final credits, I could not help but imagine the director thinking: "Oh, God, how the hell did this sleeper finish?" By the way, the director presented carefully planted suggestions and subtleties that lead to climaxes, all more visible than Waldo in a street crowded with dwarves wearing only black sweaters.
