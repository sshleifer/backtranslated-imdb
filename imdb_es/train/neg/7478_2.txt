When I saw previews of this movie, I thought it might be silly, but at least it will be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere in the background, the producers had an interesting message to convey that the parents were alone and reevaluated their lives, the way they tried to convey that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict what a stupid mishap will happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was, at best, mediocre, which is still More than I can say of the movie itself.
