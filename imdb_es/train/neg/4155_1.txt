Okay, I knew this would be an alley F film (far below the standards of movie B), so I thought: "Man, I could laugh a lot, so let's see how they kill some infidel beings." Well, what What I got could have been found at your local "love toys" store. Random lesbian scenes, very few fights and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one particular scene I remember (just for its sheer stupidity, I've seen better porn on ABC) is where the two main characters (I can not remember their names beforehand ... great movie, huh?) are driving, as they did mostly, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Come on stop, I'm tired. Do you want to take over? Passenger: "Sure, I can drive for a while." (Once it stops, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's tits) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that! "Driver:" It's okay, everyone does it sometime. "Passenger:" OK then. "(Proceed to take off the shirts, caress, kiss and perform a fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now , the last time I checked, the horror movies were not in the pornography section of Hollywood Video (unless it's on S & M, then you go the other way), and it definitely should not be in the main videos on Blockbuster. I'm definitely not one of those people who hate pornography, but I only see it when it's appropriate and I definitely do not want to see it if I'm looking for a movie in the main stores, since this one I rent was in one of the two retailers at that I named (and probably also to the other if I were to look). <br /> <br /> The worst movie in history, nobody should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. I would do it, but I can only give it a * of 10.
