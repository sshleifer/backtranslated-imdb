First of all; It is very delicate to try to describe the path of history only from positions of arms, germs and steel. The same tried to make Marxists from economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not be just luck, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. We see, that all over the world, the advantages and bonuses are completely useless if they are not handled with prudence. In Japan there are no huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's leading economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, there is only medium-low success. Both nations had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why this gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, germs and steel, to UNDERSTAND. Perhaps the main factor in the difference of the world is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things. The mental capacity to understand. And in this case geography is only subordinate.
