No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The moment of the launch was horrible. The Gong show had already "jumped the shark" when the movie came out, who would pay money just to see some of the censored clips from the original series? And the clips of the program are just a little bit of this pathetic 90-minute screech from Chuck Barris about how difficult his life was as a show host. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his disastrous millionaire life? Did he really think that we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA agent). Did you think that the joke of having everyone, everywhere, audition for him would stay cool for 90 minutes? Or the network executive harassing him at every step? This could have worked like the plot of a 30-minute comedy episode, but not like a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie "spicy", they only included their more vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out, this is the first significant part of the Phil Hartman movie (although it only lasts a minute). Keep in mind that your name is written HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name with which he was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expressions, although he is much thinner and younger than in the days of the SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; One of his first after leaving the world of soap.
