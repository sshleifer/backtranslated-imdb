This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period of 1989. The constant recognition of his character for his hidden comic book genius and frustration with regard to the humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than from the script. The film is nothing compared to his successful feature films, like Big Daddy or even the cheesy Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to consistently, successfully, and playfully express himself when this movie was made, as well as his character. Most of the "jokes" in the film come from Sandler talking to himself, usually about his unrecognized comedic talent and punishing himself because he's too ugly and can not get women. The movie is hard to see too because it does not treat itself like a real movie. Sandler speaks with the camera and the spectators throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw this movie after it was over, fearing that if he found out more, it would ruin Sandler's career. Spend this in the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
