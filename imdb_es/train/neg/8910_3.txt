This movie has a very simple plot but somehow very bad. The whole film is about a girl who is sucked through a door into another dimension and, years later, a witch opens it again, while a group of friends (including the main actor who is having problems to overcome her ex-girlfriend) , which is one of the others) the campers along with their new partner ... another girl ... it is true that they are lesbians and there is some nudity, of course, for no reason in particular). Unfortunately, the demon follows the now adult girl. Also unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where were they exactly? Where did the devil come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator costume? I think the acting is terrible, but it's hard to say because the writing is so bad that maybe there's nothing they can do with it. I give it a three because the fighter was pretty good and the effects were pretty funny even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be fun.
