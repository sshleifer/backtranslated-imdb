Amateur, no budget movie can be surprisingly good ... however, this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Oh, another atrocity of Brad Sykes. The acting is horrible, except for Emmy Smith, who shows some promise. The "direction" of the camera needs to be seriously repaired. And no more tricks of "hold the camera and run"; it just does not work Special effects are not imaginative, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you are going to tear an ear, do not let us see the actor's real ear under the blood. The stage is tasteless and boring (like other adventures of Mr. Sykes), and the music is a cross between cheap motel pornography and the very bad guitar driven by metal (see the commentary on the stage). The lack of a real plot, or the development of the character? Apparently, the writer did not do it. <br /> <br /> Whoever funds this guy ... please stop. I have seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not connect) and they are just as bad. Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this type. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Definitely not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn grains would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Prize: The worst military push-ups in a movie.
