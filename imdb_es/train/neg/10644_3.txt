Well, here we have another role reversal movie. There were many that were worth seeing, despite the tired plot of gender reversal. However, this is not. In previous reviews, I think I have expressed my opinion about the general decline of enjoyment of the Haim films that followed in the late 80's. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> 'Only one of the girls' is about a high school boy (Corey Haim) trying to avoid his bullies by disguising himself as a girl and attending another school. He joins the team of cheerleaders and befriends the cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not keep the farce for much longer. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was crap, and it was not even funny. But, judging by most reviews, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or the queen of teen sex, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would want to see this. If you are looking for a good feature of Haim (or role-playing comedy), look no further than 1989. This is about the point at which Haim's career sank.
