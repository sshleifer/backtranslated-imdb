* Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Back to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The performance was not good and the plot was not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good movie for television. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first movie and put much more into his character than in this one. It seemed as if HE was not even interested in doing the sequel. His performance was good but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because, in my opinion, it's not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. The character of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the movie. Suddenly, she is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The paper did not make sense and should have been thought a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His performance was far below decent and the casting people should have looked for someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confused character. He seemed to have a purpose to be there, but his death did not seem necessary. The performance for this role was good, nothing excellent, but better than Salem's. <br /> <br /> The plot was very bad if you thought about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his screenplay. He runs into the director and in a short time, the director is dead and Stanley is in charge of the show. Yes, out of nowhere, the team is going to let this stranger enter the picture and finish the movie without knowing anything about it. There are some murders, not many, and those that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on set is electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character is chewed by a motorboat. And one gets entangled in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been difficult to excite. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way he continued to change from a low-budget to a normal aspect began to become irritating very quickly. In addition, the new cabin next to the lake was badly created. We did not show it, but only in some scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first movie just because they showed us much more the room, but it did not work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. Everyone, except a few, had no reason to be there. The performance of what is shown little was really bad and ... they just did not have a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel choice above where the first one stayed. "Cottage by the lake" I can take, but this was not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this, and so have you. It's nothing like the first one and it was too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and continued for the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need help sleeping. <br /> <br /> Then, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. From the way he talks, it seems that there could be a possible third installment of a good movie on its own. Stop throwing sequels and we can be fine! <br /> <br /> (Did the filmmakers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one?) They were all made in a tank Never, never reveal the secrets of filming. <br / > <br />
