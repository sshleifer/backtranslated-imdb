As a former teacher (!) I must confess that I have gone through many scenes, 'although I kept looking until the end. I wonder why?! (Boredom, perhaps?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first initial scenes seemed incredibly mixed and out of focus. The plot also, although there were some good ideas, such as that of a relief teacher, for example, they did not concentrate enough in any direction for 3-D development. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr. Nolte's best moments As for young Mr. Macchio, do you talk that way in * all * the movies? <br /> <br /> Leaving aside complaints and interpretations, hairstyles alone were a nostalgic (albeit nauseating) journey. <br /> <br />
