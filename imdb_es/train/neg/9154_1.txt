THE. WORST. MOVIE. FOREVER. FACT. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie supposedly made by homosexuals, I suspect that someone rounded up a half-blind neo-Nazi with brain damage and made him make the worst gay movie in history, all in a deceptive attempt to Attack the gay culture. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come alone, so I had someone to make fun of when I paused the movie by surprise, disbelief and outrage at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> Above all The horrible writing and acting and the illogical and stupid plot, it's just a bad movie. A dog with a handheld camera attached to its tail could have beaten better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews that this film has here, I suspect that the writer must have half a dozen IMDb stories. Anyone who says that this movie can be seen as more than a joke, is a liar or is paid a lot to say it.
