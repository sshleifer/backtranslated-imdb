I only saw it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and presented Claudio Cassinelli, an actor that I like. I certainly was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to death for television ratings has been exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie Death Race, which will no doubt stink I'm inside because it's starring Jason Statham <br /> <br /> For the most part it was a bore. The action "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. The "training" was a dream party. He just never grabbed me and made me want to worry about anyone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned and you will be better.
