I admit that I liked the first one, and I was looking forward to the continuation. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Surely the special effects were technically amazing, but they did not look believable. It was more like a caricature. Okay, I admit that I like 80% of the chase scene, but the fight with all Mr Smith? I was too obviously encouraged. <br /> <br /> I can accept all that. What I can not accept is that the parts that are not action were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that a speech that lasted forever and that meant nothing was waiting for me. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed by the small plot that existed. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except about the existence of the matrix). This movie was a bit like watching the episode of DALLAS, where you discover that the entire previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
