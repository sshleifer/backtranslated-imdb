Great cast Great performance Unpredictable story line for the first half <br /> <br /> approximately. I really wanted to know what would happen <br /> <br /> with each of these unredeemed characters, and how their seemingly disparate lives would intertwine. But when <br /> <br /> the writers removed the glue to start connecting the players, <br /> <br /> mistakenly used the super glue and stopped the film <br /> <br /> during the last two hours I kept thinking that it would improve, but only <br /> <br /> worsened. Do not believe the criticism. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it, Tom Cruise got ugly, why? The magnificent <br /> <br /> hunky bartender with suspenders, why? I know it had to do with the plot, but without them, at least I would have been an attractive cast member. <br /> <br /> to remember.
