This is, by far, one of the most boring and horribly fulfilled stories of the first days of Adolf Hitler that I have seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to interpret him as Hitler is simply a mistake. To choose Liev Schrieber as Hitler's old friend and helper, Haefengstal must have uttered cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, badly wrong cast. This was not a nice family movie with a good historical background. This was the garbage of Hollywood at its best, taking advantage of the strength of a cast of strong actors (but very little used) that seemed to have disappeared from the radar in the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> The false German accents (vee vill vin zis var) insult the Germans everywhere. My mother is German and she sat down furious at the sound of the voices that kept changing American / English / German in the same sentence. The support cast makes better cardboard cutouts in the local video store than on the screen. However, Jenna Malone, like the fatigued Geli Raubal, was splendid, captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who finally ended her own life to escape what her future would have been in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you want a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years before including the war / holocaust, rent "Inside the Third Reich" 1983 starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler It was good and it made more sense then this baloney. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can tell you in all sincerity that he sent me to my books to confirm my great amount of inaccuracies.
