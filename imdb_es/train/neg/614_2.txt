I'm watching this on the science fiction channel right now. It's so horrible that I can not stop seeing it! I'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the work of the camera is good. The majority is very questionable. There are a few decent actors in the movie. Pity they are surrounded by what should have been the relatives of the director. That's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! The music was a little better than the acting. If you dare to see this, I hope it is because there is absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes, sequel) is already underway ... I think I'll skip it! Jason
