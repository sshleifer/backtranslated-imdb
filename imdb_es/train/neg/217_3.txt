This is a film that is based solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. That is all. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent. The performance and dialogue are more suitable for high school children, however, the subject is intended for adult audiences. It is a gutless and superficial film. It could have been much better if I had a story and more drama. Oh and on top of that, one more thing: why are internal monologues so excessively used? It makes it look so cheap. In general, it is an embarrassing film for the Romanian cinema, as well as for the mature public that tries to see it. I know that the means are scarce, but that is not always an excuse for the failure of a movie like this one does. And start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from the musicians (Tudor Chirila). They can not act!
