I will not address and criticize the theories of RAW. I mean, this is a site about movies and if the movie is presented or done well, and it's not a philosophy of site discussion. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this video really explodes. It's a talkative head shot of RAW after another. One part is a stock video, so you can see how it has aged over the years, and that's great. But, otherwise, the visual experience is implacably monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison, but I kept thinking about Sunday afternoon when I saw some of the star vehicles of Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * (another very bad image). movie). After a while, I felt really good with Barbra, and I kept wishing there was a scene where I did not show up: you know, "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were plotting something else ..." moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well, this video is * Funny Lady * by RAW. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at multiple shots and angles of RAW's face as it runs through your theories, it is assembled into a lame structure that adds no interest or vision, Then be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
