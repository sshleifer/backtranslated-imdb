This has to be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. First I saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great. Since then I've always wanted to see it but I never found it ... ... until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Let's say I was so disappointed that it's unreal, well, I knew it would not be an Oscar winner, but I still hoped it would be fun. Brainless film in the blood sport mold. Unfortunately it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> what's up with all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad that it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were garbage and fake looks. <br /> <br /> This DVD only cost me £ 5 and I think I'm overcharged with £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I'll never get that hour and a half turn
