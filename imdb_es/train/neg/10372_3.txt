I enjoyed the first critic's comment much more than the movie when I saw her in a second-direction theater in the early 80's. I was then impressed by the care she had taken in creating costumes modeled so closely after Tenniel's drawings. But for me, the cast was squandered to a great extent, their personalities suffocated by masks, while the direction I consider unusually static, and the photography murky. The rating noted at that time was null, which means that "it is not worth sitting even once". <br /> <br /> Even so, I would also take the opportunity to take a second look.
