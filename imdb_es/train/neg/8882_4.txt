Calling a film about a crippled ghost that takes revenge beyond the grave and death would be too ironic, but this is an indisputable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); Although you can still see yourself, it is so clich√© as to cause giggles instead of the chills that are intended. However, thanks to the difficult situation in which the British film industry was at the end of the 1970s, even a mediocre script like this one could attract 10-star names: Cliff Robertson (as the connudo husband), Jean Simmons (in the title), Jenny Agutter (as the half-sister of Robertson's artist), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as an unfortunate doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons' best friend and Jayston's wife, Flora Robson (as housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary who reads Simmons's will) and, most surprising is that Jack Warner (as a tombstone sculptor), although the Most of them do not have parts, I'm sorry to say!
