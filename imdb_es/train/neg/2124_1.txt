This film is about the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his return home to old friends in a coastal community. The plot involves the group of friends as soon as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with the death of a friend in which he feels responsible in some way. But this is inconsequential, since the choices made in production are extremely poor and have not been made at all. The scripts do not always have to be "talkative", but at least they should help the development of the story. Here, a line of attempts like "he just took off" or "I know you do not have love in his heart" simply evokes something worthwhile for the audience. In addition, each time the writer feels lost as to where to go next, he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through the fields of indie humor music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the kind that gives you quality and substance over style, this is not the movie for you.
