Killer on the highway, he's a madman who shoots people on the highway while shouting a lot of mystical chanting on a car phone. Police believe he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blond heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects a pattern. So does the former policeman, played by James Russo, and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has eliminated his wives. Also starring Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments, especially if you like car chases, but for the most part it's not a good movie, check it out if you're really bored and you've already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown . Otherwise, stay away from the highway.
