This is a science fiction movie of formula B, and the director did nothing about it. It is a dragon that is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything done is things you've seen many times before. It is a weak script, without real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypical characters and situations. The director attacks this by simply turning it into a formula film, without any attempt to deceive us, and that gives this movie a soft appeal, but it's not something you can remember a bit. It looks better while you're cooking, cleaning, exercising. A kind of senseless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you feel with friends to watch, unless you're all drunk and do not mind. The massive rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it's as horrible as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the publications thought this was spectacular. That really eludes me, since I do not see any attempt to make this a memorable movie.
