I go to UCSB and I take some classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She is an excellent teacher and director, so whatever she puts her name, I think it must be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Bárbara film festival seemed a good option. <br /> <br /> While this film included some pretty shots and cinematography, the lack of history and coherence really pushed away everything I was trying to accomplish. My main problem was that this was someone's first movie and obviously it could be said. The bad performance and an even worse script prevented this movie from taking off. The soundtrack had a nice music that gave an idea of ​​the struggle of the main characters to overcome the sadness that led him to leave and now to return to the place where he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the best crafts in the film, its lack of history and performance really prevented it from being a good thing.
