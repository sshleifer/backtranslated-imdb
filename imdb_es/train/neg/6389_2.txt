I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking that it could be an underestimated job, since during a period the animation no longer had the quality it had had. Starring one of the best villains in the film of all time, it was based on a beloved series of children's books and was produced by Disney Studios. What could be wrong with that? As it turns around, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rankigan and the ostentatious score of Henry Mancini are the two saving graces of the film. The price is incredibly nice, and Mancini is more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs to the dark. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the film, although full of improperly adult situations, still suffers from a completely boring script, a generic voice job, terrible songs and a lazy animation that would not have been out of place in any of the television programs on Saturdays in the mid-eighties of Disney. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. By costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD in its endless run time. <br /> <br /> The additional star that prevents this from being "horrible" is for Price and Mancini. .
