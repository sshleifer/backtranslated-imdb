Not even Goebbels could have performed a propaganda trick like what Gore has done with this complete piece of fiction. This is a study on how you can spin the numbers and statistics to say what you have been told. The "scientists" that Gore says have signed on the validity of global warming include social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say that a meteorologist is an expert in neurosurgery? The field research and data analysis involving geologists is not compatible with Gores' alarmist claims about global warming. As one of those geologists who worked in the field for the past 40 years, I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this film and the actions of Gores in the last two years lead me to the conclusion that global warming is their way of staying important and relevant. No more no less. Ask any global warming alarmist or "journalist" a simple question: you say that global warming is a major problem. Tell me. What temperature is the Earth supposed to have?
