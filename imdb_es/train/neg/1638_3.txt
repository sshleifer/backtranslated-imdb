I wanted to see Amanda Peet in another good role after having recently rented "The Whole Nine Yards", which is worth renting, by the way, but it was not this one. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the trailer for "Whipped" was fun and the plot of three twisted New Yorkers in their twenties, all fallen and manipulated by the lovely Mrs. Peet, was worth a try. Then, I convinced two friends one afternoon to watch this movie with me. This revision is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have the three main asparagus, relating their conquests in a restaurant. What should have been fun, or at least said, is quite pathetic. Was there any redemptive quality about the three men and their encounters that were supposed to come out of this? <br /> <br /> [And while I do not mind movies that are gleefully vulgar, I kept wondering why no one in the dining room turned around when the stallions are talking loudly about the sexual and eschatological details. Do they do this every week in the same restaurant? One would think that someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other diners realize in one scene. But this is just a configuration for a punchline. Everyone else in the dining room is deaf.] <br /> <br /> The second act has the three asparagus, all fall in love with Mia and then develop brain rot, and do not ask themselves about what really It is happening between the four. . And I kept asking myself, while the stallions continue to act as they have been, what redeeming qualities do you see in them to keep with them more than one date? Does she start with brain rot? I kept waiting for Eric's character, the married friend, to become more than just the annoying punching bag in this act. Your role is clearly to give advice about being married. But why do they bother talking to him when they do not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act solves the plot, but by then I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something really fun to happen and I had to agree. The scene that explains everything was adequate and managed to explain all the questions and bits of mysterious dialogues throughout the film, but we were only marking them from a list. ("Oh, it's okay, that's why Brad had to happen and Jonathan says this and ...") <br /> <br /> The laughs we made were because of the stupidity of the plot, because of anything fun. Even the shots during the credits were not very fun. Ultimately, I was left with nothing, except the desire to warn people to stay away from this movie.
