I wonder who, how and, most importantly, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to address the most unique sensation that affected Broadway in many years? He is a winning director of an Academy Award. Yes, he won for Ghandi, asshole! Jeremy Irons is a winning actor of the Academy. Do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a beautiful war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The movie is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of living energy survived the heavy-handed procedures. All the characters danced beautifully they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw him on stage, I felt everything. The film should have been released with stars, unknown, newcomers, but stars with unforgettable and convincing faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance very well. Well, Michael Douglas was in that. It is true that I forgot that I am absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a musical by Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas.
