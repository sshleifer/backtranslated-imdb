DEATHSTALKER is perfect for fans of fantasy movies B; this farce of barely 80 minutes of filming includes everything fans can ask for: non-existent conspiracy, terrible acting (except for at least one old woman with a hoarse sound), laughter scripts and schlock edition, and a basement-style background of bargain adjustments There are no characters that look nice or interesting (in particular, the protagonist has NOTHING attractive in it), and the assembled actors barely do anything to rise above the grade F material. If that is not enough, then What about the lack of a convincing argument (that this movie does not have any of that) for DEATHSTALKER to qualify as a great turkey? I was also offended that the women in this film barely serve any purpose other than 1) being topless and / or unclothed; 2) be violated; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all the previous ones. Also, the background music is horrible; a strange mess of electronic noise, cheesy coral bursts and a loud orchestral cacophony. The numbness of the ears and the numbness of the eyes, all in one, packaged with one thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for people looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's a lot of that here ). Otherwise, I do not recommend this 100 degree CONAN wish to anyone in the least.
