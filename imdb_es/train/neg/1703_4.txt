A Vietnam veteran decides to take over a backward city that gets mad, and anyone who crosses his path is eliminated (including women). Released in theaters just before "A Star Is Born," which changed his career, this mishmash of action and drama starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly discourteous, inconsiderate and petty. Filmed in Simi Valley, California, the results are truly unseemly, with clich√©s of redneck and mindless violence that make up the bulk of director George Armitage's script. Armitage has put together a more curious cast of the 70s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Principal Victoria, Bernadette Peters and, at one point, Loni Anderson; However, the center of all this is Kristofferson, who is gruff and rude in everything. I guess it deserves points for being a thriller to drive completely unfriendly, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) cover the whole project as an ugly stain. * 1/2 of ****
