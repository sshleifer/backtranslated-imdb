Horror terrible sequel to "The Howling". This begins with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee sadly) arrives there and tells Karen's brother, Ben (Reb Brown), that Karen was a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the werewolf head. Ben and a Karens co-worker (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, a bad direction, an inept edition and a truly horrendous performance by Brown and McEnroe, sink in on their own. The effects of the werewolf are mainly kept in the dark, for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Also the special effects of low quality, although I liked the cartoons of rays that come from the fingers of Danning. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning takes off the top at least EIGHT TIMES during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the village in Transylvania fun - it looks like it came from a 1930s Universal horror movie! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at this, but they can not save it. Really - WHY did they do this? Where do they get difficult for money? This is one of the lowest IMDb movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when he saw the movie. I can understand why! A must see
