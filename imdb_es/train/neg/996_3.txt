Revenge is one of my favorite subjects in the cinema. Moreover, "the uselessness of revenge" is one of my favorite subjects in the cinema. Having seen Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak, half-hearted attempt that expresses nothing but the lack of conviction and focus of the film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The final scene, a man-to-man bull / rape free scene, appeared as nothing less than a rape fantasy for female revenge. However, the movie does not even go with this. Instead, the prolonged scene (which FAR overcomes the brutality of the initial rape in both the degree to which it was graphic and in which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of regret or "This did not happen " "Do not fix anything", while the violation of your rapist continues in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not of surprise, but of confusion as to which graphic scene it was trying to reach the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we upset by the brutality of all this? Do we feel the moment of lamentable clarity of Dawson? Apart from this flaw, the film is really a bit clumsy with more style than substance. The characters are fine, the dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> Normally, I try to take movies on their own terms, but Descent did not seem to really know what they were. Thumbs down.
