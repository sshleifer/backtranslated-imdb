My friends and I left after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. Afterwards, we try to recover our money. Film management would not allow it, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time it worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: former child star. As you can see, this was not a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. The second should be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. In conclusion, for the good of humanity, please, do not see The Order.
