[I saw this movie once late at a public television station, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple Lo did in the early thirties. It is hard to believe that anyone would allow their daughter to participate in this little film that could now be considered on this side of "child pornography". <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple plays a cast that probably has an average of 5 years. Everyone is in diapers and in a room that serves milk instead of alcohol. The "cash" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays a "femme fatale" at the bar and talks to the soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not really need her pallets / cash because her purse is full of other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a small black child dances suggestively at a nearby table (!). <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. . . babies who use racy dialogues who play adult roles in a classroom. Who thought this somehow?
