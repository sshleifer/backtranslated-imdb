This is not a movie, it's a 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon on the number one sport in the United States, high school football. Another long and serious message for converts, who are then presumed to be sufficiently excited by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue as "You won the big one when you accepted Christ" loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in the sunken black eyes of director / coach Alex Kendrick. Then there are the "parables." <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is intended to foreshadow the miraculous climax, in the course of which the trainer asks his reckless kicker: "Son, do you think God could help you kick that?" It's the kind of entertainment we could have expected to receive funds based on faith to infinity, if only the hegemonic activities of the Bush Evangelical Christian Administration around the world would have convinced us to become "devotees" after his example. Watch the poor trainer of the Giants in the apocalyptic final, urging his team to cry "Who's with me!" whereas the devout Eagles on the other side went silently doing the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So, do you think our terrified support makes your kick to beat those egocentric Goliaths? Well, we all know that fans can not lose. Put it this way: transfer the playing field to the deserts of the Middle East, replace Christian proselytizing, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban parable against superpower, which devoted worshipers of this garbage might want to think about. about a minute <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they will not care, nor will they need: as the trainer tells his team of empty containers before the game, the answers are all here in this book. And the Christian right will devour this on their way to their ecstasy, that final victory for which they have prepared their fields.
