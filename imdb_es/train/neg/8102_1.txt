Oh, I heard a lot of good about this movie. I went to see him with my best friend (she is a woman, I am a man). Now, please, allow me a divergent opinion of the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "take off your clothes", we both feel a very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (we did not do it with her), we slept (and we would have been better in our bed), we were convinced that we had spent money in vain. And we had it. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to worry. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This movie does not even deserve one in ten votes, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation for being excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a minimum of taste or intelligence.
