My God, this is one of the worst movies I've seen and seen a lot. I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did he need the money so badly? I love AJ and I've seen almost everything he's been in, so I saw this 2 mark another. It was so bad! not even good bad, just bad bad. He had 1 or 2 little funny moments, but overall it was a 101 minute loss. I can not even say that AJ looked good because she did not. The plot is predictable unless you are expecting a new version of Romeo and Juliet, then it is not. All disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good movie otherwise I really do not recommend it.
