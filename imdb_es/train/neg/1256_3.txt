This film is another attempt by director Tim Burton to capitalize on a family title to bring his 'vision' to the screen. He has done it with 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing that has in common with the original is that it has apes that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the whole story, diluting it for today's massive audience. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the 1960s, the United States was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking of social norms. It was in the age of civil rights that groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equals. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical agitation faced by the audiences of the time. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that tackled difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white man justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was stimulating and intelligent, with both subtle and obvious ironies. <br /> <br /> Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is apes for mannequins. It is superficial and yeyune, substituting the politically correct places for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on the form than on the substance. The final 'surprise' is totally incongruous and does not contribute anything to the film, except for a cliffhanger that establishes the sequel. While the end of the original POTA gracefully tied everything into a single powerful scene, the end of Burton simply mocks the audience, mocking: `I know something you do not know, and you'll have to wait for the sequel to appear. <br /> <br /> From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camera work is exceptional (although I still dislike his dark appearance). However, thirty-three years of advances in prosthetic make-up can not compensate for the insultingly empty script. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans join behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Ape, aided and abetted by a few coats (in particular Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulated and simplistic with much violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. <br /> <br /> The performance is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor who is simply misinformed in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark and shadowy characters who are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspiring hero, a profile that is not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actress whose character is so far below her ability that the disconnection is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the weak character, but her interpretation is presented as a cross between a university peace protester and a sickly enamored teenager. <br /> <br /> Then there's Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, which alone saves the film from total ruin. Roth is devilishly hateful like the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in a long time. In addition, his physical performance is superlative, which makes a chimp man a combination so perfect that you can almost believe that the species exists. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment. It's a decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it with a 3/10. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, maybe a 9/10. However, the story is an insult to the original franchise. It's just another Burton attempt at self-adulation, using a family title to draw crowds to the box office so that many people can see what genius it is. Of course it is true, but it would be great if you used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of a simple-minded paper formulated for mass consumption.
