I guess this is a French movie, LOL, with an emphasis on young girls with much older men ... why are the French so obsessed with this kind of thing? When the age difference is so great, it really looks like a pervert! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she looks a lot like Olivia Hussey, from Romeo and Juliet from 68 of Zeffirelli, set in a similar period), but she is about 15 years old and the actor who plays Tassi, her painting instructor, looks .. Well, 50 is KIND. <br /> <br /> Other posters have done the job of explaining the historical record (unusually detailed in this case) of Artemisa real, a great artist and one of the first recognized painters of this period (17th century). Her story speaks to us in modern times, particularly because of the old accusation that "all great artists were men" (she almost ruins that statement in pieces) and because the story of her rape trial is very moving. Not only was she clearly attacked and forced into a degrading sexual relationship (because in those days the marriage with her aggressor was the only way to avoid social shame), but Tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and son. <Br /> <br /> The film does a terrible damage by reversing this truly fascinating and extraordinary story of real life, very dramatic and without the need to "splash", because in some strange and frenzied way, it is "hotter" having an overexploited adolescent drawing male sexual organs and having a loving relationship with a man old enough to be his grandfather. That's "sexy": the truth is boring and it seems too feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> I am also concerned that this is ONLY part of the life of Artemisia considered interesting enough to film. The fact that she painted for decades (her famous painting of Judith decapitating Holfernes was painted AFTER, not before the rape), that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she had children ... oh, that's boring stuff. After all, it is a middle-aged woman and they are not "hot" like teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is a lot of creative license to make a movie (or a book) about a true historical character. You need to create a dialogue, have subplots, create a dramatic structure. Certainly, some details can be sacrificed: it's not a big deal if the dates move a few years, or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (when we know from her self-portraits that she was a brunette ... and a big bone) one, not a skinny little one), or something like that. But changing her story and turning rape into romance is really sick and disturbing. It's even worse because the director is a woman. I should be terribly ashamed of herself! <br /> <br /> If you LIKE this (and I know that some people do not care about the real woman and like the period costumes and hot sex), you probably like "Dangerous Beauty" with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack. In the same way, based on a rewritten history, with many bulging breasts and cups encrusted with jewels: Bon Appetit!
