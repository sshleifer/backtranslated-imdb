It's not as bad as you've heard. Actually, there are some fun parts and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and pleasant as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are accomplished professionals. They are pretty good at almost everything. In the end, "Survive" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is out of focus and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts of black humor come out as bitter. Affleck makes a great effort to be extremely spastic and overzealous, but he feels disturbed. The caricatural nature of her character is highlighted when she is seen alongside the quietest and most credible performances of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even with the relaxed standards of Christmas movies, you never fully accept Affleck's configuration to "rent" this family for Christmas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border on the surreal in its strangeness. . The Christmas Eve scene full of incestuous humor (a son who discovers himself looking at provocative photos of his naked mother) is not only funny or credible but also disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost noirish. The set of houses where most of the film takes place seems scenic and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Survive" is of great interest as the fourth in a series of box office signings (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how long the damage will last.
