I have never seen this movie, but I can tell you one thing about its production. While I was a comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked me if I would write and record a bit that they would be dropped on the soundtrack as eminent sounds of a television (the TV screen would never show). As I said, I wrote a parody of 1950s sci-fi monsters clich√©s, I gathered some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the role of a woman. When he was in the air at that moment, he put on a long song, joined me in the microphone in the production room and cut the vocal track in one shot. Laughing, she went back to her show while I mixed the ridiculous sound effects. We would never have done it if we had known that "Woodchipper Massacre" was going to be a great turkey, but they did not pay us for our efforts either! - Gary Theroux
