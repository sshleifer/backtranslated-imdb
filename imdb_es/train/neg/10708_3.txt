This movie had the potential to be really good, considering that some of the elements of the plot are taken from the science fiction activist THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends a cheesy appeal to their roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball with this one. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk who kicks his butt (!) He travels to New York to retrieve a key that opens a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the Antichrist for 2000 years. He must fight against the servant, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body in the same way that THE HIDDEN AND JASON GOES TO HELL. The servant, naturally, wants the key so he can let the antichrist go. Along the walk there is an annoying archaeologist and together, she and Dolph are chased by the bodies possessed by the minions. <br /> <br /> If I'm making this sound entertaining, forget it. The pace is very uncomfortable and slow, in the best case, the bottom that acts, and the fight scenes have a bad performance. Dolph walks asleep through his role and throws some of the worst dialogues of his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really increases in the end when the servant fights against an army of armed machine guns in the monastery, but the rest of this movie is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
