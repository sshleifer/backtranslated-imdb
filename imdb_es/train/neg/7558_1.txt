Whatever you do do not waste your time at this point without meaning. movie. A remake that did not need to be counted. Everyone who left the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas' cage cycled through the hills, swam in murky waters and rolled across the hills while being attacked by bees, but his suit was still perfectly pressed and the white shirt until the last scene . <br /> <br /> Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the performance was as amazing as the film itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. They do not get a copy of the script first. If you are still interested in watching the movie, wait for it to appear on DVD.
