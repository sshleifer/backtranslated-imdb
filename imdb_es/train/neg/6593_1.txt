Even if it were remotely fun, this waxed-up film would still be disrespectfully disrespectful. Stopping to unearth the corpses of the boys and recreate 'Weekend at Bernie's'? but only alone ?? Producer Larry Harmon and the director of Frickin's films 'Ernest' use copyright as an excuse to shit on Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain makes an imitation of just Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot would not reach the tenth place in a contest of aspect of Stan; Even if both were spot in the movie it would be no less detestable. The less said about the surrounding catastrophe, the better. It makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song.
