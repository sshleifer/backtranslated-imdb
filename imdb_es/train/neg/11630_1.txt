The worst movie since Open water. Do not be surprised if you completely lose this movie on the release date, as I'm sure it will not go very well at the box office. This movie had a lot of potential, but it was reduced little by little. There is not enough development of characters, uncomfortable actors and The positive aspect of this film was the nudity. Tits. Amazing. If I had to watch this movie again, I would go POSTAL myself. <<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< << <<<<<< <<<<<<<
