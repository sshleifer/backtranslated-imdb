The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that I had Erika Eleniak in it. She is sexy as always, but plays a supporting role to the protagonist Wolf Larson. It's a shame, because it has more action capabilities than you can show here. The film largely consists of endless shootings that quickly become monotonous, especially when most of the time you see the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing Larson and he armed only with a revolver (which NEVER runs out of bullets) taking them out all quite easy The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there are also many fuzzy movements and bad bursts of CGI. As the psychotic "spiritual leader" Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo he has to spit out is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming you have one) the completistas may want to take a look at this, for others it's hardly worth renting. (* 1/2)
