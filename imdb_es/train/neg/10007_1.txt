This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as fun as a bag of hammers. His malicious attitude of "Law and Order" moves in a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one left unharmed in this horrible comedy. The only positive thing that comes out of this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. Hopefully that effort will produce better results.
