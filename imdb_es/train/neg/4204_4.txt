David Arquette is a young and naive seller of security alarm for the home <br /> <br /> seller taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy <br /> <br />, who got a big sale on his first visit to the widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her foolish son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well <br /> <br /> for Arquette, he is appearing in commercials for the security firm <br /> <br /> and is falling in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right-hand woman, Mary McCormack, let him in <br /> <br /> in a little secret: sometimes they burst into their clients' houses <br /> <br /> to scare them and get their neighbors to buy <br /> <br /> signature security systems. Arquette decides not to get involved, take Capshaw to meet her family and go through life with a silly smile on her face. Then someone breaks into Capshaw's house and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci, and places a series of traps, resulting in a gun to his head <br /> <br /> while Tucci declares his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, "The Alarmist" does not open well. The scenes <br /> <br /> in which Arquette takes Capshaw to meet his parents <br /> <br /> are misunderstood and are completely unfunny. They are also offline <br /> <br /> with the character that Capshaw plays, while getting drunk and tells <br /> <br /> sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother, Michael Learned. In addition to these scenes, Capshaw does not have much to do, but she does a lot with what little she is given. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, like Terry O'Quinn, is a riot as the owner of the security company <br /> <br />. He is a madman who really does not understand <br/> <br/> the moral revulsion of Arquette. However, when it becomes a whining <br /> <br /> after Arquette kidnaps him, it's very funny. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a more important role, but <br /> <br /> she almost always agrees and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to be a silly teenager, but it's fun, especially <br /> <br /> telling his explicit sexual story to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script wobbles from romantic comedy to dark comedy too <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw meeting with parents is completely unmotivated, <br /> <br /> except to give him a reason to leave the city so that someone can <br /> <br /> enter his house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie alone <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to get revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has shown that he is a good actor, is horrible here. He is based on the constipated assault that helped him overcome those <br /> <br /> ads from AT & T, and is not a presence strong enough to build this <br /> < Weak Filming Around Actually, Reynolds could have been a better option <br /> <br /> on paper. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's address is good, nothing that will win an Oscar soon. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's jazz light remembers the kind of noir movie that this film <br /> <br /> tries to be, and it's also quite catchy. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, the failure of Arquette as an advantage and the schizophrenic quality <br /> <br /> of the script sinks the film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, violence with firearms, some blood, <br /> <br /> strong obscene language, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual content <br /> <br /> references, and adult situations.
