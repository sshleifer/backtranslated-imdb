I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. The majority of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this dramatic comedy, but I did not. It stars Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. The three actors do a good job in this film about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and the infidelity that involves the third. Everything takes place in a lake house and it looks wonderful. The film wants to treat its theme as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it had to be the other way around.
