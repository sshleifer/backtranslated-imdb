Gods ... where to start. I could only stand the stomach for the first 10 minutes before turning it off with disgust. Apart from the actor who plays Robin Hood, the rest was simply terrible. And, I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief until now. <br /> <br /> Since the opening of the first episode, I lost count of how many mistakes, plot holes and horrible costumes there were. He started with a poor peasant trying to hunt a deer to feed his family. All good and good. However, the poor fan must have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armor, on horseback, could sneak up to about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then, as he runs away, he goes from having them 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you can not even see them, immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again. Then, he runs into some bushes, and immediately he is mistreated by two of the soldiers ... who just a few seconds before, galloped on horseback, dozens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "armor" on the soldiers have such painfully obvious clothes that they tried to make it look like maille and they failed miserably. Not to mention that the "armor" of the main soldier is about 5 sizes too big for the poor. Seriously, it looks like he's a little boy in his father's big armor! Finally, Robin manages to shoot about 5 shots perfectly directed around the hand of a soldier, in the span of about 2 seconds, of what appears to be a recurve bow. No live human could make that kind of shot, in that short time, with a rifle range, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they escape from the soldiers and stop to help an incredibly well-dressed. and clean "peasant" with digging a ditch ... something that all the nobles were willing to do all the time, right? How this sorry excuse for a series ever had a second season beats me. The production costs (at least from what I saw) must have increased by dozens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, I think a high school drama class could have had a better interpretation. This was so bad, even that terrible version of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I suggest you skip this monstrosity and go rent or buy the "Robin of Sherwood" series from the mid-80s. Much better written, performed, disguised and produced. <br /> <br /> To shame, BBC ... to shame ...
