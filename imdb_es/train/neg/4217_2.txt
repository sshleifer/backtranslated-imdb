This was recently in the classics of the vibrant AMC movie and I had to laugh. I had great hopes for this adventure that continues in the line of "Journey to the Core of the Earth" and "Mysterious Island". I felt very disappointed, not only because of the credentials of the actors, but also because of the stupid story that is read in the comic of a five-year-old boy. Make sure you see the wires that cling to Pterdactyl's wings when they grab "Ogar," a pre-modern idiot man who befriends lost adventurers. The end left him open for a new review of the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Do not waste your time.
