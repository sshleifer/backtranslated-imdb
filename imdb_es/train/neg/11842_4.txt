Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that he is only "acting". Although I like Izzard. The plot is very boring. The viewer has no real connections with the characters, without knowing with whom to really sympathize, or even worry about them. Slow film, boring, with some laughter, but few and not very funny anyway. The plot is not attractive or suspense in the least. You can see every turn of the plot that comes a mile away. What is this movie supposed to be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You will not do it at the end of this movie.
