You do not expect a movie like this to be good, and it is not. It's an ultra violent zombie movie, without a budget, filmed with a handheld camera that looks bad ... and is hilarious. Obviously, the actors have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The small plot that I could find seemed to be that an experiment of the government escaped and a group of zombies seems to be terrorizing a pair of families. The blood effects are actually some of the most disgusting I've seen. It seems that the gore effects of people raided a carnage in all parts of the body, and many scenes involve zombies that dismember people and eat their organs. It's a funny and sickly movie, and it's as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
