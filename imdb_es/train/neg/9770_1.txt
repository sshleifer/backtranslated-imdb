This is the version that even the author hated, because it is very clumsy. They gave him a "happy ending" and changed the dialogue a lot, and it's just a big pile of saccharin. The "stage director" is quite good, I think he originated the role, but all the others fall into the style of acting of the 40s that is actually raising. The only great feature, music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth looking for in a record store. In general, I think that the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller is far superior.
