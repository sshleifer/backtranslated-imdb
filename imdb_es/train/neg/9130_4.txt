It's true that some fans of Peter Sellers' work may be disappointed with this, his latest adventure. But surely any Sellers fan will be delighted with all his films, simply because of the great talent of the man. and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, this would be the last Sellers movie (it even premiered after his death), but it's still nice to see how the man managed to keep his irreplaceable talent until his untimely demise. And not only did we get a Sellers, but we got it, because Sellers not only plays the main role, but also his nemesis, the equally strange Nayland Smith, the detective in the search for the crazed Fu of 168 years. The story is equally extravagant, as we follow Fu's extravagant pranks to create his elixir that defies age and also Nayland and his group of associates who try to avoid it. Like any of Sellers best films, the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him, as well as many of his familiar-faced co-stars: David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren for name a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther hardcore Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoying a cameo with Sellers, even if it's the same role, but it's still nice. The story is quite ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, who classify this as a movie heavily influenced by Goon. And, although it never reaches the heights of Goon's comedy, there are many funny jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially in its initial release due to the mourning of everyone after the death of Sellers (the film premiered less than 3 weeks later) and there is always a sad thought lurking in the back of his mind upon seeing that it was Sellers. Last movie It is far from being a great movie: it is often slow, too ridiculous and, sometimes, the jokes are simply not there, but in spite of everything it is nice, if only for another excellent performance by Peter Sellers.
