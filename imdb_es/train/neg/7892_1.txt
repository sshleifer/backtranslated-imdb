It started with an interesting premise. I always like things from the Civil War and the old secret societies. The more the movie progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at best. In the second half, it quickly became a movie in C, then in D, then in F, then "I wish this was not a rent to put it in the microwave!" I can not say that the performance in all cases was horrible, just the majority. The writing, however ... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10-year-old boy. It was ridiculously superficial, the dialogue was monotonous and uninteresting, the characters were as interesting as a 5-pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This movie did great damage to the cause. Horrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I recommend Superman 4.
