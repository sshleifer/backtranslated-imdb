"Rambo: First Blood Part II" by George P. Cosmatos is pure wish fulfillment. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage in this country beyond imagining and this film continues the fairy tale of the innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, he laments that Americans of American origin did not appreciate or celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but he has only distrust of important officers and politicians. Like all films that defend the war (for example, "We Were Soldiers"), it also avoids the need to give an understandable reason for commitment in South Asia. And that's why it's also the reason for every American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo takes revenge for the wounds of an entire nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with memories, instead of suppressing them. "Can we win this time?" If you can.
