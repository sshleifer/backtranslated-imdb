If Ashanti had been a serious attempt in a film about the institution of slavery, still prevailing in third world countries, the film could have been better received. Instead, it becomes the disaster of a movie full of stars in which the stars arrived, their lines said and they collected their paychecks without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and we are busy doing humanitarian work in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov, who can barely summon enough ham to do the part as a Muslim slave trader. As Johnson is black, he grabs her anyway along with many children and some adults as well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine does not take the kidnapping well and the rest of the movie is passed in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking incredibly bored with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Generally in something like these talented people Like those mentioned above, they will only act exaggeratedly and delight in a diet of landscapes. But Ashanti does not even have that in his favor. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax depreciation is permeating the air.
