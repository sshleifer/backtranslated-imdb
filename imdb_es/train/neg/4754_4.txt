I loved the original. It was brilliant and always will be. Although strangely, I actually expected to see the new version. I'm usually a little against repetitions because there are too many, but somehow this intrigued me. I was really enjoying it to begin with. Caine bright, as usual, and Jude Law managing to hold is own at his side. It was quite smart how it was modernized and worked. What prevents this from being really good are the last seven minutes. It moves completely away from the original, in fact, until now it stops being intelligent and becomes annoying. The ending in the original was fantastic! He accumulated so much tension and was incredibly smart! Is? It grows not in tension but in frustration, as they seemed to have decided to turn the character of Caine into a homosexual. It was if they were trying too hard to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is worth it just for the performances, but those last seven minutes really drag it down. What a pity....
