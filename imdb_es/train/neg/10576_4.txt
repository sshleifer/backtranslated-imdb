I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and attractive: each episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a famous and notable horror director. Then, when I finally saw them, it was a bit disappointing. Some good episodes arose from that first season, but in general it was a mixed bag. I attributed it to the learning curve, and I thought that season 2 would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in shock. At least the first season had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat", starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total and total loss for me. The "I like" episode may very well be the worst thing I've seen on TV in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 changes next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
