Although this is not a "great movie", there is something convincing and memorable about it. As another commentator on the film, I saw it in childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. See it if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of the life of a small town as it evolves through the decades. More than any other film, it brings a human face to the historical drama of "progress" at the beginning of the 20th century. It is attractive enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. In addition, it is easy to like the characters and observe their passage through time.
