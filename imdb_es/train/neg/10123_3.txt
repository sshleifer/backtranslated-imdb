I imagine that when the experts and experts of Hitchcock are together, the talk is not about the great films of the Master as "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train", but a lesser known effort like this 1931, dark and seriously defective , which shows the great director as a novice. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class couple from London who skimp on staying ahead. He spares their luck; she accepts it The change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying that it will set them up so they can enjoy a life of luxury globetrotters. They make plans for a world cruise. But your problems have only begun. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is indisposed at the moment, but you understand the idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, preparing one for a dangerous trip at best. This is perhaps Hitchcock's first foray into this subject, and not the most successful or memorable one. Hitchcock tries to mix the comedy with another element, in this case, the domestic drama instead of the suspense, but the two do not join, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The hills are a boring and flat couple, without chemistry or personality. When they are in the Folies Berg√®re, in the form of a cross section with images that look ten years older than the rest of this film, they feel embarrassed by the costumes of the female artists. "The curtain has come up too soon!" Gasps Emily. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the hills move away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems merciful to kill more than a tragic thing, even if the people they associate with are dripping. , as well. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) takes pictures of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which suggests Emily fill them. Fred's girl, "the princess" (Betty Amann) has the eyes of Clara Bow and the five o'clock shadow of Wallace Beery. There is also an odious traveling companion, a disheveled spinster who Hitchcock always presents with a cartoon horn. The subtlety was still to come. <br /> <br /> Everything was filmed abruptly, with a confusing block and a tense dialogue. Hitchcock tries an early comedy with Fred and his umbrella that is not removed, and Kendall seems to point to laughter while Berry plays crying. When Fred and Emily separate, they are pushed by a pair of fitted rickshaws, one of many clumsy attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely sympathetic character, partly because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her adventure with Gordon, but mostly because she is one of Hitchcock's first magnetic blondes, her curls platinum whip his face like a Botticelli aboard the open deck of a Chinese scrap near the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> Things conclude with a dangerous situation as a game piece for the protagonists to face and, presumably, repair their relationship. Only that they are not active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the end resonates. <br /> <br /> At least you get some nice views of London in the early 1930s, and the chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working to eat. "Rich And Strange" is Hitchcock who pays his dues and learns his trade, one for scholars, but not for casual spectators.
