I agree with the previous comment, what a disappointment. I rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie, since Mira and Olivier were in it. I was surprised by their performance, I expected more since they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start but it got worse. I even laughed at some bad acrobatics !! When it's supposed to be a mystery movie. You can even guess in advance who is the killer. <br /> <br /> Really what happened? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say it, but do not even bother, you will waste time and money. <br /> <br /> Bored!
