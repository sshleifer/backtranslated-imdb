['The mind, my friends and I saw the movie based only on its title. It&#39;s nice, although it&#39;s obvious in its plot and direction: you know where the movie goes in the first five minutes. My main argument with the plot is that, while still quite consistent, they never explain many things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overworked mother, a stressed sister ... is a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of the sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused about the scene with the bottles ... it seemed quite random. <br /><br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... children were not bad actors, but their script left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a nice niche movie was pushed aside by a unique special effect, blah, unconvincing scripts and a clearly obvious plot.']
