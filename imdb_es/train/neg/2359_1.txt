It was supposed to be Freddy's last film (and it was for more than 10 years), one would think that they would have tried to make a good movie. But they ended up giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot did not make sense (I do not remember), all the main characters were idiots (REALLY you wanted them dead) and Freddy's jokes were even worse than usual. The only thing remotely good about this was a short (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare" movie was his first). <br /> <br /> I also originally saw her in a theater in the last section (retelling Freddy's childhood) she was in 3-D. Well, the 3-D was pale, the colors vanished and the image was focused and unfocused. Also the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. ALL broke into laughter. It looks even worse on 2-D television. Useless and stupid - also very boring. Skip this and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
