I can find very little to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the script looked good on paper, but I'm afraid filmography and acting are not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I would like to doubt that this occupies a prominent place in his CV Filmography. Michael Caine appeared on wooden occasions in his role as doctor, and at no time did I believe in his character. The plot was incredible, especially with regard to the victims' son. Some of the scenes are very reminiscent of other movies, which sometimes asked me if it was really a suspense movie. The lighting was sometimes dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some stars with big names, wondering why I bothered to see it.
