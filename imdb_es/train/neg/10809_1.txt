This is the worst movie I've seen. I was watching this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not a single sympathetic character. I could get more entertainment by watching static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale did not enter negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
