This movie is just horrible. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are the worst actors I've seen and the stage is so bad that it's very funny. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor is supposed to be the quietest type. all the girls, but it's ugly, it's overweight and it seems it's from the early 90's. <br /> <br /> All the characters are absent during the weekend for a meeting between friends, but nobody is really friend! The married couple has not seen the "main" guy in more than 5 years, and even then they were not really friends. The "date" of the main boy only knows him from work and, in addition, there is a girl who pick up in a bar. Now tell me that you would risk losing your job and spending a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste a minute of your time with this lemon. I've made home movies more scary than this! <br /> <br />
