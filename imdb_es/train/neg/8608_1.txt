This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. He also has the always nice Larry Miller in a too small part. Despite this, I found it almost impossible to see. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty, but she is almost free of charisma and the reasons for Downey's character obsession with her character are not entirely understandable in terms of the information presented in the film or the way it is portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and, although it seems that the intention is for the public to join in the nod and guide the nod of the film, the fact that we have not managed to get close to the protagonists does not allow us or we can not do it. <br /> <Film fans say that those who do not agree simply "do not understand". I do not think this is the case. The plot was not complicated or beyond comprehension. It was simply unirvolving and clumsily and obviously fabricated. I understand. "I just did not like it." I Went Down "by Paddy Breathnach and" Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "by Guy Ritchie are much better examples of the type of film that director Shane Black fails to achieve. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mainly as a screenwriter) makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection.
