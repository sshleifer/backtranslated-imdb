Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and the high rating, this is a horrible movie. Horrible enough, that I feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the final period of the Raj, during India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot simply fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave just does not convince me that the characters exist in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, if the young married Hindu maid from the local village had an affair with her married English teacher, knowing full well that the discovery of the adventure would probably mean complete social exclusion and shame, if not a deadly punishment. ? It is unlikely, but still maybe. However, the same young Hindu maid, in the conservative society of India of that time, would continue as a half-naked Britney Spears in heat, would participate in hot outdoor sex during the day in open view, where they could be discovered anytime? That is not only improbable, it is a delayed plot. <br /> <br /> Such idiots combined with bad acting, led me to leave the cinema an hour after the movie, so I did not see the second half. of the movie. We could only expect the end to be more intelligent than what I saw in the first half.
