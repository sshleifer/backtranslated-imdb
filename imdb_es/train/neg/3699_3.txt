<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie, and that did not happen even during the final comedy scene (which is also expected to be the funniest). This is one that you can see when it comes to television, do not spend any other money renting it.
