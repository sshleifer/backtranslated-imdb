Here is a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn on the screen and resorted to entertain myself to the MSF2000. The plot is based on casual events and is based on the stupidity of people who are supposed to be intelligent. The advantage lies with a scammer and it does not occur to her that she can be scammed ???? And she is rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist? Come on people. She enters the bar at the most convenient time when everyone gets together to talk about how to cheat her. That was so staged that it felt like a slap in the face, even for the half-witty moviegoers. The man in the rain would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet's dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for those who eat meat, those who start the war and those who wear hairs. My hate is so complete that it defies logic. But I'm going to give it a try. That is not supposed to sound real is fine. I do not care. It's that everybody talks the same thing. Mamet can not create characters; All you can do is impose your voice on us without rest through different actors. No wonder its actors are so wooden. They are confused about that they are all the same character. (However, his latest films do improve.)
