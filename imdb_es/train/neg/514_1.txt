This is one of the most insipid, dull, unoriginal and meaningless movies ever made! It almost seems that everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an attractive movie. This is nothing more than the continuation of a series of exhausting films that try to take advantage of the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best movie of all. As for this waste of movies, Burt Reynolds walks through the whole movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors do not have much to do, the car races are obviously footage, the humor is not inspired and many scenes They are more boring and lifeless than looking at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous movie that has nothing unique or distinctive.
