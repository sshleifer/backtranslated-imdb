I am an avid fan of horror movies, my game is cheesy and ridiculous. So imagine my spirit I went to the local rental store and found vampires against zombies. The name is too entertaining, you know that nobody in the world could achieve something like that, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, it's BAD. After watching this horror movie, I was speechless, literally. My friend and I sat outside without saying a word for several minutes, both contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, "... friend ... What?" Yes, I am an exciting person. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, never, constantly in the "WTF" mode. The characters; There is no development, forgettable. Music; Worse than porn. The vampires; His vampires? The zombies; Your zombies? <br /> <br /> At the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so bad that I look forward to seeing it again. So do yourself a favor, look at it and get depressed.
