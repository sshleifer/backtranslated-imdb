Unless you have twelve, this movie really is not worth it. Obviously, it is a low budget movie with B actors and a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I like to laugh at bad movies. Although I did not know how bad. It is bearable, until after hour 2, then it really starts to burn. The fighting styles go between the normal fight that obeys the laws of physics and the fight of cables. There is no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot, but once again, it is obviously a movie for children. It seems that there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are broadcast, like Sesame Street or something like that. It's bearable But much better if you're, say, nine.
