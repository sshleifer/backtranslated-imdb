If you are seeing this without the slightest idea of ​​what the story is about, then you will be surprised. Even then, the synopsis has painted an image of a fairly healthy plot, but the film itself has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis was, talk about a mountain climber obsessed, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening of credits and text tracking, informing you of the presence of Chronopolis, a city imaginary that exists in dream manuscripts of the mind (note for itself, this means problems with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal who long for a change in its omnipresence. You can see our world, and realize all the people of this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet man. <br /> <br /> What it resulted in, is a repetitive animation that a 5 year old could produce. Have created forms, although the credit goes to the style of stopping the movement, and put it in a loop that numbs the mind. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then continue with the next scene. In any case, the chonopolisianos (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly play to conjure that magic sphere and have a field day playing with it before throwing it into the "other" world. Nor does it improve, when man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotically boring and dream-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thank God, of course, the execution time is shorter than what is announced, which is 57 minutes. (or less) against the 70 indicated. Although they are dated, their colors muted, their history non-existent, their soundtrack and their repetitive images will not win the fans. Do not waste your time.
