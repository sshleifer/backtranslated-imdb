This movie was interrupted by MST3K and with good reason. First of all because it is a "police" movie starring Joe Don Baker, which we all know is a police actor as good as Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical plot of a police movie devices raise their ugly heads, bar fights, child hostages in shootings, bad acting, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / justice, thugs endless and, of course, bad performance. Do not look at this without an MST3K filter.
