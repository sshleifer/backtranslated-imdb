Last night I saw this movie in advance, but it really did not impress me much. <br /> <br /> With the exception of 'Combo', I thought that the acting was bad and that the narrative was limited. It appeared as a drama 'made for television'. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was very artificial. The complete configuration of hammering in the context at the beginning (yes, we understand that this is the Great Britain of the 80s - it can be stopped now) was boring, and gave a very partial view of what life was like in Great Britain of the 1980s: poverty, War juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing in the middle? Actually, there were middle classes at that time, only ordinary workers, with a decent salary and a mortgage. The clips of the Falklands also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, by "dramatic effect", I suppose. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events felt a little disjointed, as the characters moved one action to the next without seeing how their thinking could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was going crazy. I could not even look during the kissing scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she had been attracted to a boy who was not only much younger, but also looked much younger. I know that they only spent four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach twenty, but it's a big difference in your teenagers! In my experience, that kind of difference in adolescent age only happens when the girl is the youngest, since girls mature much faster and are more on the wavelength of children for a few more years. I'm sorry, but I did not buy it, an unnecessary trace point created for an impact value. <br /> <br /> The end was something abrupt and, again, artificial. If the flag-throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell short. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that British films only worry about the upper classes or the poor. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can not the British do something different? Why are our films always so hung up in the class system? I was born in 1973, so it was not very different in age to what 'Shaun' would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single-parent family on a council farm in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were very different from those described in the film; I do not even remember that racism was a problem (although I'm not saying it did not exist). 'This is england'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that I felt that this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and not impressed at all.
