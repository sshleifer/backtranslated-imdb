It really impresses me that it was done. The director / writer / actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can not think of another way to pass the script. What I want you to consider is this ... while watching the movies, I felt sorry for the actors. It felt like being in a comedy club where the guy is dying standing up and you sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him, do not try. I would really like to know what the budget is, I suppose it must have been low, since the quality of the movie is really bad. I want to write 'I did not like the jokes'. But the reality is that they attract you, you have to be the man who wrote them. or a delay. So imagine that in the form of a script ... and this guy has that green light. That's awesome, is not it?
