It is always difficult to have a better brother in your life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let the bitterness take you away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa Claus and then imagine how difficult it must be. That is the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, a bitter loser who spends much of his energy making sure people do not wander around expecting good things to happen to them or giving them to their brother Santa Claus ( played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for being simply the protagonist, hungry for fame, a somewhat creepy guy that Fred would want to play. Then, you would not know, Fred needs an economic favor and, therefore, has to compensate him by helping his brother on the way to Christmas. And hilarity and life lessons occur. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie with some good moments from Vaughn's patented music video, a music video ridiculously out of nowhere, Kevin Spacey playing an auditor to close Santa's operation (and it's one of the weakest bad guys) I've seen in a long time), not enough of the beautiful Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas attire, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, it's a standout) and a movie that is too full of bitterness to feel like a good seasonal meal, but too clumsy in its second half to feel like a funny blow to all the bad things about the commercialism of the time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz also agrees, as Kathy Bates is, but it's really just a movie for Vaughn and if you like her style, you'll find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is very little else to recommend this seasonal stench. Aside from Vaughn's criticism, the script barely casts anything decent, with the exception of a particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group that deals with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> The address of David Dobkin is as mediocre and serious as that of 20p The Christmas card he sends to the aunt he has not seen in 10 years and seems to think that simply put the ingredients together without a good mix or a decent care will guarantee you a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we have a burnt, soft lump with too much sugar on top. Forget about this and hit the hilarious Elf again if you want a great modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Santa Claus 2, Santa Baby, Santa Claus 3: The Escape Clause.
