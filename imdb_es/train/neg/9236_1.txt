I am among the millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can not think of a single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it seems that no one else did it, if we want to judge for the small amount of movies in which he played later. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was excellent at chasing and capturing Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here the director or the writers try to repeat the problem. idea, but fails miserably. I have read comments about how "creepy" Drake was, but I thought it was a too soft description. Franchot Tone walked through it like he had a hangover. A casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know why it is a requirement. Too bad, it was preserved when there are so many valuable films that rot in vaults. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give this one a big detour.
