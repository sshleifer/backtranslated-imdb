Overrated and only for those people in the 20s who wear particularly thick pink glasses, who never really saw it in the first place because they were very young. Horrible animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 80s, the new puzzle trick TOY (that's right, TOY, not the "absurd, pretentious and alienating action figure of collectors" for children), sold on the back of a poor caricature and other paraphernalia , it only matters for those who bought the TOY when they were "real" children in the period from '84' ​​to '87'. It has become a cult because the adults themselves are immature to let go of their memories. Avoid.
