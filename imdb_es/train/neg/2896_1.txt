I could not bear to sit through the whole movie. Do families really exist like this somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as something similar to the LLBean models, and I think that is a great description of how they behaved. <br /> <br /> The most absurdly incredible writing / acting happens when we meet a character. which is referred to in High School as "pigface" which, of course, has become a magnificent plastic surgeon educated at Harvard for 20 years (but only to do good in the world, not for the money) and she he sleeps with Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I stopped seeing ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then you may enjoy this waste of sentimental and self-indulgent time.
