After having read for many years how great this film was, how he established Ruiz among French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers people), when I finally saw her about a year ago, I found it quite disappointing (but then, I suppose that my expectations were very high). Filmed in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for television and, fortunately, only an hour) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they reflect on a series of paintings. (shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they contain some clues about a hidden political crime. (The horrible movie by Kate Beckinsale Uncovered has a similar plot). Borgesian is a word that I read a lot in reviews about this film, but I would say that almost any Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
