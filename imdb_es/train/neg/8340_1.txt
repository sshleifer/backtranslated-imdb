One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I got so bored that I turned it off to watch the news. When I turned it on again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are some more dreams in between. Come on, what's supposed to keep me interested in that? A movie needs to have a reason to be interesting. The moment you felt that the movie was only a dream is when any sensible person going to the movies goes off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling you their dreams and what it means to them? This is all !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
