... bothered to make this movie? No one? I did not believe it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie to come of age, go rent the summer of '42. This is not the summer of '42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte and Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more time on screen, that's your first warning sign And, of course, for such an "artistic" movie, there's a lot of curses and skin around, just to make it look "artistic". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, peppered with moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of someone with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is most famous for her appearance and what she said about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her. She misrepresented a real Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style. Woohoo! Was this your first role after graduating from high school? <br /> <br /> So, we have this strange triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but he is with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed, and he will not take his boss to bed. Then, he hangs up with Sarsgaard and Miller, and he sees them how they put on. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of the moments of pseudointensity of Sarsgaard, Foster and Miller are set in motion, a scene that we "treat" In every careless detail, moan. Finally, just to round it all up, Foster and Sarsgaard get it, with Foster in the role of Miller. Now I know how 2 guys put it (as if that was something I always needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all that, all that remains is the tragic end for one character and the retrospective views of the remaining 2. It puts me right in the pit of my stomach. Oh wait! That was the pepperoni pizza that I just had. <br /> <br /> I would like to recover the moment this movie left my life, please.
