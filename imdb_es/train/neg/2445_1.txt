Hi, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are a spectator of this movie: join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must, it's bad in a nice way. Here you can see every clich√© invented for a horror movie. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.
