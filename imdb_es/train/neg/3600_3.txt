A question for all the girls: if a man he has never met before has accidentally called him on purpose and continues to do so at the most indiscreet moments, if he was intrigued or scared, he would call the police. ? Yes, that's what I thought, so I could not swallow the idea that Marti Gerrard would take the unjustified attention of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a really silly story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question: Is Connor calling Marti so he can have an alibi? But here is a big gap in logic, could not Connor have hired an assassin? Something that the prosecution seems to have ignored. And there was no forensics at the scene of the murder? So, why is the entire trial based on Connor telephoning Marti at the time of the murder? Silly . Silly . Silly . And it is as predictable as it is brainless. <br /> <br /> My lasting memory of this film is that for someone who participated in the Winter Olympics, Marti Gerrard is a very bad skier.
