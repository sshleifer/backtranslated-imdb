I just do not understand the great premises of this episode: that Miranda is so remarkable and that there is something so ugly that it would drive you crazy. Someone here made the comment that maybe it's the frequency of light waves or something like ugliness. Miranda is just an idiot. The episode is slow, inconsistent and too loud. I also do not understand why Kolos is an ambassador. Why does not the Federation just leave the cursed Medusans? There is a part that I like, when Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. In general, I love TOS and even at its lowest point, I will always tune in. Although this episode, mmm, I would not buy it except for a used copy of less than $ 3.
