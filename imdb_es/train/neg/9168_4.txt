Randolph Scott is leaving the United States for the greenest pastures of British Columbia Canada. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with his partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stamped their small herd on a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later, Jory creaks his cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the failures. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good westerns with adult themes, some of them considered authentic classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo trail will never be included among your best westerns. <br /> <br /> It's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. The story is downright silly at times. Williams, who was traveling with Scott, wanted to look for gold since at that time there was a big strike. He does not blame the thieves, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip because of the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by the Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule has been taught to kick in command and he kicks the Indians for our heroes to escape. I'm not sure I would have played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the story really wants you to believe that prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles into a gold strike after a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes. on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell part of the Gabby Hayes movie. It would have been better if he had come out in a good western and, in fact, he would have made a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this. <br /> <br /> I will say this, although no Caribou appeared in the movie, this is one of the few Canadian locale movies of the past that NO Mounties had. <br /> <br /> But if it were you, unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour to The Cariboo Trail.
