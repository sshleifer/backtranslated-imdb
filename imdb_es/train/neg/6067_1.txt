LIGHT SPOILERS (but it does not matter anyway). <br /> <br /> An exercise in deceptive catastrophic proportions that are not even worth the 10 lines I need to put these comments on the networks. This is the worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first to qualify for the late treatment of Mystery Science Theater. Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the desired ironic angle, it was still a very small mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that forces us to realize that, in addition to the gore and ugly masks, the genre is only successful when the classic cinematographic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put into practice . Here they are absent and John Carpenter is not a teacher. Period. And no trivial analysis of easy social comment here will change that. Interestingly, Carpenter has never been more than a director B, but at least movies like 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had a fantastic vibe (the latter is one of my cult favorites). <br /> <br /> Abominable interim. The camera angles stick to the cement. Rhythm without tension. However, perhaps the most unpleasant element of the episode is the story that, of course, can not be blamed on JC (unless the writers were Cody's friends). The first two minutes of a girl running through a forest are only close. The duo Scully-Mulder is the first and the last thing that works in the movie. But come on, a girl who rushes through a deserted forest to nowhere in particular who desperately needs a miscarriage, meets the fender of a couple of women's rights doctors whose clinic is at the end of the road. the corner. Oh, and I will not even know how the doctor impacts the accident in the car and moves away from 0 to 60 in six seconds. Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion. <br /> <br /> Then things fall apart very fast. The empty dialogue "I just want to help you", the endless slowness of the back and forth in the door, the great battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) Followed by the shooting: a new birth , the director of the clinic Ramboesque vs Ron Perlman and the bullpen of the high school to give some kicks in the Easter holidays. Another charming phrase: "So what are we going to do?" of the boy who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the truck. Er, no, it's not yet a pheasant season. So, who needs those teenage boys anyway? What about the good and proven method of the lonely lunatic who makes his way through the door with his totally American SUV? <br /> <br /> Regarding the exchange of bullet scenes themselves, the cuts here were as rigid as the staccato of a DC comic strip. All that was missing were the titles of Wham, Bam and Whiz of the globe. And all to the rhythm of a soundtrack worthy of an old episode of Mannix. <br /> <br /> At one point we learned that Dad is not really the father, but at this point we did not care much. more either. The only source of drama in this story is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter, who is only grateful that she has not had twins. However, there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they really meet together. They remain simple abstractions from each other throughout the process. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the access controller, all the characters are absolutely unpleasant. Sosa, hysterical, bored, macho. As perfectly flat as the human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seems to have anything medical about them. And there is that father who fights and criticizes his pregnant daughter as if he himself were the stressed boyfriend. Fortunately he got his. There are two great comedic moments worthy of MST: the pop when the Angelica pipe goes off and then the newborn lobster with a glue on the baby's head. The belly of Angelica's rugby ball was also beautiful before the little monster of the right to life finally appeared in hell. As for the audacious scene of male abortion ... well, they should have retained the Miike episode and banned this in their place. <br /> <br /> In short, Rosemary's Baby meets Alien set in the territory of an M.A.S.H. episode. This smelly single, appreciable only for the permissive generation of children under 16, will ensure, as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. A real shame, as there have been a number of brilliant productions, including really decent parodies like Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's deliciously quirky 'Sick Girl'. Not to mention the magnificent images of Malone's "blond-haired child". <br /> <br /> Sorry, John Carpenter, I think your management days are over. It's time to run for president.
