A romantic and completely false vision of the unemployment of a middle-class "artist" with a comfortable education ... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience in this regard. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live the day with jokes and childish jokes. They never look for work, almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living in a strike is like a school summer vacation ... ridiculous. Especially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces such as Ken Loach, etc.
