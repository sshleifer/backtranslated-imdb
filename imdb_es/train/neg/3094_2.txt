**** MINOR SPROILERS *** As a bad movie connoisseur, I must have seen hundreds of bad movies and yet, "Hobgoblins" stands apart from everyone else in its own unique way. Bad classics like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Hands" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand, starts badly and gets progressively worse as it progresses. During my first viewing of the infamous scene of the rake fight, I thought this was a really bad movie. I did not realize that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The film gets into the hell of celluloid during the painful and inept sequence of "Club Scum", which is a continuous chain of a joke without grace after another. With just this movie, director Rick Sloane proves he deserves a mention with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Look at "Hobgoblins" and do not ask anymore.
