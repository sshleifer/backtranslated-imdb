I give this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible It was very badly performed, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops did in this movie. I will not even write spoilers for the plot because the movie is not good enough for the spoilers of the plot. Writing comments about the plot would not make sense. If I had to compare this movie, I would have to compare it with Reign of Fire, however, although I did not like Reign of Fire either, that movie was at least better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was halfway there. The only reason I did not do it was because I just did not think about doing it. I was expecting a CGI party and I fought brilliantly, but that was not what happened. The martial arts lasted all 30 seconds and that was an exercise routine done during the flashback scene, very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank battles, the troops fire ... nothing. Someone forgot to tell the animation guys in that movie, so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I'm also thinking that the bad man's voice was dubbed by Imotep's voice over from the Mummy movies. Had that same scruffy echo thing going on. (Has anyone owed any royalties, here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene, I would say that it could be considered a spoiler, but I suppose only for purists. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to see it, nor buy the DVD when it comes out. You have been warned.
