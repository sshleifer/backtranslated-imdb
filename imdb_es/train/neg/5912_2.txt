Having enjoyed the previous work of Mike Myers (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a bondage parody of the 60s were quite high. After the first minute, it became clear that this was an exercise in how to be as childish and as graceless as possible. I disconnected after ten minutes. I saw it the other day a second time to see if it had been unfair the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I can not believe that even a twelve-year-old can find this funny. The dialogue is a nuisance, it hurts Myers to see (as Heather Graham is) and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes matters worse. Apart from the slightly entertaining title and the psychedelic scenographic, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Personally I recommend that you avoid this as the plague, although several friends of mine enjoyed it (perhaps they had their eyes blindfolded at that time).
