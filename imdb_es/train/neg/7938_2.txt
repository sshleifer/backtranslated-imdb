A family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father's coffee table book meets an ancient and decrepit freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family's van breaks upon leaving the show, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades earlier. <br /> <br /> There have been many films in the 'Freak' subgenre of horror, ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to the hilarious 'Freaked' by Alex Winter (1993). Those are the two classics (or soon they will be 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho', however, never will be. And if it ever reaches the classical state. . . Well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our gender. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, this movie did not have much in her favor. The writing was unsatisfactory, but not entirely horrible. . . Just bored. The direction was bad, and the rare abnormal effects were pretty horrendous and incredible. The acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believed the ages of these two camp-age teenagers should not have met a teenager in a long, long time. There was not enough gore and violence to compensate for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a little violence, nothing was done well. And I can not stop mentioning the fight scenes that were, in all honesty, some of the worst I've seen in a movie. In general, this is an easily forgotten and badly made horror movie that deserves to be left alone in the back of the trash can. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
