It is difficult to know what was going through the heads of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space": the film is cataloged like a comedy, but there are no real jokes next to the crude names of the characters (Capt. B. Dick, Sergeant, Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie is a (presumably) amusing matter without meaning to it with ridiculously desynchronized voice-overs (with the "actors" basically reading their lines without hints of feelings), "futuristic" computer screens full of spelling errors and a plot that almost does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Even though 65% of the viewers have given this film 10 perfect out of 10, this is the opposite of what a good movie is. It can be entertaining to watch with some friends, but this movie only deserves a '2' out of ten ... a little higher than the lowest possible rating just for the mere fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black men protagonist in this movie
