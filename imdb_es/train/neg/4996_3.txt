I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, it became corny, or should I say, "just stupid." This is just another example of outdated humor. It could have been fun in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked it once he began to change his youthful appearance and his high voice from the musicals of Busby Berkeley to where he is mature and also sounds it. <br /> <br /> I was fine as "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest of the cast only played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but scream all the weather. It was brutal to listen to and it was a great detriment to the movie.
