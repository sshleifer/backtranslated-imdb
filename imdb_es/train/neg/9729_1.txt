Seriously, what is this? Hooper has made movies as classic as the Texas massacre, then made this awful movie of God, what happened? Did he immerse himself too much in the crack? This movie is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to set things on fire, (Firestarter, anyone?) The acting was great, the plot was garbage, and the special effects were extremely garbage, they looked like something from The 70s. Van Damme should be happy that Derailed is not the worst movie ever, and what happened to the end? it began to shine blue, it became a bright blue spot, it breathed in the fire of his girlfriend and the movie ended. WHAT WAS THAT? HUH? When the movie was over, I expected the DVD to spontaneously kill itself to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK, OBEY, OBEY, thank me later.
