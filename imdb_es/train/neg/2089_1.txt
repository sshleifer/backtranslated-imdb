Of course I was watching BG. I loved S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was good and I loved the final. Yay, there's a spin-off show! I did not know anything about this, one of my friends told me about this. I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of junk! Teen drama festival. There's no science fiction ... well, almost none. At the end of each episode we can take a look at a Cylon. That is all. Who cares about this? Did you decide that the target audience of the next program will be women under 18? Bored religious nonsense talking, moaning, complaining ... and something else. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there is nothing out there at this time. Stargate ruined, BG about ...
