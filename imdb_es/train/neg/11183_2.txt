"People I Know" is a group that has no one to root or worry about, despite the gaming efforts of a talented cast. <br /> <br /> Pacino offers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman, an advertising agent from the past, cousin, drowned by a life of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma or his destiny. <br /> <br /> The film tracks Eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause, while being distracted by the client. (Ryan O'Neal, good in a part subscribed) the last "dirty laundry": in this case, a television partner who has been involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings his usual star power to this support role, although, again, the script does not give him much to work with. Like Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite the implausible mechanics of the plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is strictly for those who like to watch Pacino show his stuff and enjoy the other directors. Unfortunately, between the script and the direction, "People I Know" is strictly amateur. Hence his limited theatrical release and his quick trip to the DVD. Consider yourself warned.
