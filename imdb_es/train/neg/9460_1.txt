This movie has made me angry! When I think of cat in the hat. I'm thinking about the cat in the hat books. You know, the one a few years ago that parents read to their children. Well, I thought that this movie would be very similar to that! But to my surprise there was nothing like books! Insted is more like a humor movie for young adults. In one part, the cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) the cat talks to him as if it were his hoe (an adult humor). The denomination of his car, although it was a little unpleasant for a movie for children. Below the grade you will find: mild humor and some double meaning. I think that ultimately means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said they would not because the movie has been opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest that you maybe rent before buying.
