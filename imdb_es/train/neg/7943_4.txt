THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook when the Israeli defense force meets a terrorist base. This is the kind of hook that is essential when writing a script, it grabs the reader / audience and the presentation of David Bannon when he rents a room to Abby and Russell Quinnn expresses the point that this is a man who is not who. he says it is. However, after the grand opening, the rest of the movie seemed confusing and not involved with a lot of moles and it is not so different from the thousands of other supernatural thrillers I've seen.
