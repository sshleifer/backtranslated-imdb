The fact of having seen this whole movie says something about that ... or about me. It is not a good movie. Terrible indeed. But terrible in the way he kept my attention in that wicked way that is similar to seeing a tragedy and not being able to look the other way. It would have been a great theme for MST3K! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a terrible movie pleasant are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, invented plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will be thrilled by the sequences of death in slow motion, the poor victims with their mouths open and wait too long to contemplate their imminent death, facing the libertine artificer of their deaths. Your heart will heat up with old clich√©s of action scenes, like when two women fight for a gun and shoot themselves, but WHO IS Shooting? Both look at themselves, then at the other, then at themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally falls down. You will sing along (in Latin, of course) with the street carols that become a dreadful death chorus that, for a moment, threatened to turn the film into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you believe how I do that as the movies get worse, they get better, so this might be a decent option for you. It's not as fun as my science fiction Schlock favorite, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than lukewarm movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
