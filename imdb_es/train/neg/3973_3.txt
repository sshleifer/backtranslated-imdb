The acting was weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with that if the story is good. It was not The initial event was a clumsy and obvious tactic to exploit the adoration of children by most people. It's okay. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. Well, great: this will be a story of supernatural horror, with rotten things partly in our world partly in ... wherever. Then, the action begins to pull like a three-headed dog in a wave of cats and birds. Is there any evil force that tries to attack them directly? Is there an evil force that tries to attack them indirectly: make people do horrible things that they really would not do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where environmental discord can reverberate in murder. Okay, wait, maybe it's just a little redneck guy mentally entangled with the style of "Delbert" who misses his mom and is on a kind of revelry like a batch of Norman Bates from K-Tel. Oh, yes, extra points: the only black character seems to be the grandson of a "Our Gang" goalie. The actor interprets it in the most direct way possible through the unpleasant dialogue, but the fact is that his purpose is: "You're done, get out of here, boss!" At least they wrote him smart enough for GTF to get out of there. The bit with the girl who was silenced and removed was definitely creepy, like the girl in the shower. Those were just two of a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in a non-harmonic way, like a bite of meat, a mouthful of chocolate and a mouthful of a Gummi bear. Each one is great by itself, but mixed? Bleah! Such potential. Vain.
