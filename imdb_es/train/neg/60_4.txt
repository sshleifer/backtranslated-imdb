I like Goldie Hawn and I wanted another one of his films, so when I saw the Protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart I bought it. Although slightly funny, the movie never gives you a good step. Some scenes, like a party scene in a bar, only last too long and really have no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, there is the preaching scene at the end of the movie that gives all the information. filming a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene is added to the movie at all. I do not like stupid comedies that try to teach me a lesson, written by some of the 60s especially burned! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm happy to have another Hawn movie, I'm not. Surely it was really worth the money I paid for it!
