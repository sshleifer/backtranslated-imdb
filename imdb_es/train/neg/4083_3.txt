I saw this movie when it was released, and my dislike for it has stayed with me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to take each literary image of the Tempest and make it literal. If a character said "my heart rises", we would be shown a real human heart, with dove wings joined, flapping on the screen. <br /> <br /> This process creates some lush pictures, but ultimately it is an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not envy the pleasure that other viewers found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was fascinated.
