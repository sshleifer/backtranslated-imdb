This movie should be number one in the last 100. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I saw her we almost became physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on talking about how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to the Frankbob review, since I see that no one else has taken the trouble to do it yet. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God we saw it on TV, so we did not spend anything on it. If we had been forced to write to the people responsible for this abomination and forced to launch an execration in his general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always liked to see Carrie Fisher perform. But I'm sad to say that it's not worth seeing in this particular movie. Do not ruin your opinion of Carrie by looking at it.
