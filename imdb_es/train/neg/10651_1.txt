Do you want to know the secret to running a film set in a gym? Simply fill out the movie with beautiful ladies in super-tight outfits and have them touch the floor as if they were in a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this horrible slasher movie did and that little trick kept me looking at the bitter end. This is the worst slasher movie I've seen in my life, but every time I was ready to change channels, they added another scene with the training girls and I stayed. As a Slasher movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for pretty girls exercising, it's a success. A strong recommendation to avoid, unless the idea of ​​half of the movie being a big T & A show appeals to you.
