I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew from the second 1 that it would be bullshit and it would be better to avoid it, but somehow, some friends let me get carried away by this. I entered the cinema with few expectations, but I hoped there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring a shudder to the face, are mostly people who receive blows to the face and balls, the baby looks weird and acts like a hot gangsta and the typical jokes of racing that we see so often. In today's trash comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and strongly stereotyped. I never want to see this **** movie again, I'd rather take a bullet in the foot than be exposed to this piece of crap ever again. If someone I see says that they liked it, I will physically hit them in the face.
