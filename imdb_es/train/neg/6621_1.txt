Something somewhere must have gone terribly wrong at the time the director perceived this argument. The film, which was supposed to be the new version of one of the most beloved films in cinema, does not appear in all aspects of filmmaking. The best of the artists could not resume the syntony, which simply shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The edition is deficient. The address is shit. Acting is out of this world (omg)! The characters that are supposed to look with fear force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and disguises. <br /> <br /> I would not see the movie, even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even if they gave me a free hamburger with it.
