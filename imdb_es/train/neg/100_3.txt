OK, it's not the best movie I've seen, but at the same time I've been able to sit down and watch it TWICE. The story was pretty horrible and during the first part of the first short story I wondered what the hell I was seeing, but at the same time it was so horrible that I loved that the laughs were cheap. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that disappointed him was half, because he stopped doing nonsense. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was quite perfect, but if after a cheap laugh and you see it in the land of the pound.
