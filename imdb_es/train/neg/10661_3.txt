It's "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley, with a guest star cast! The film begins with an accidental hijacking (convenient?), Which leads to one thing, and another, which does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Great House, United States of America". prison break story History is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a television show, just more "violent" (for the times). <br /> <br /> BUT, the cast is a trip! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; His cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a magazine "Muscle"!) And William Talman (reading a magazine "Detective"). Honest! You should know that, an early scene reveals what happens to the "disappeared" child, and responds to the end "voice over." If you do not want to be hanged, do not miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian does well as a fugitive asthmatic). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA UU (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
