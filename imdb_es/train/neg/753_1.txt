Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released before. I've been following this online for some time, and I just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think what really struck me was the editing. , or the lack of it. Again and again, the characters are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I am not a publisher, but I do know that I can interrupt someone who leaves point A to show that it reaches point B. There is no need to show almost the entire trip! Wow ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I ended up feeling a little bad for the actors involved in this. It seems that they have not been given any direction on what to do during the scenes that do not look scared or happy, depending on the action that will be added at a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why was it decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me? Even ILM still uses thumbnails at times. One of the most annoying uses of the green screen in this film is the constant rushing of (according to the final credits) the same group of people representing the citizens of different towns and cities, including London. Sometimes, these people come and go regardless of the shooting angle or the distance they are from the camera. In a shot in London, there seem to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by the star Anthony Piana without his mustache that distracts him). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen a fake piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines talked about this movie the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, smooth and simple. On the positive side (at least for me), it has provided some of the most authentic hilarity moments of loud laughter I have seen in a long time.
