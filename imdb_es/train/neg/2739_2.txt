I have no idea what this was triggered, but you can definitely say that they had no budget. The bad acting, the horrible cinematography, the lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. WWF-style cinematography will make you cry ... Where is the tripod ?! The filmmakers aimed high but missed their mark a lot.
