Dane tries with all his strength and is extreme with all his screams and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the ground. Too. Calm down, come together and make us laugh. I did not fully understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there's so much on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really interested in that when he was alive. He had some good jokes, like Burger King, where people shouted along the way. I also liked the Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane did not act so mentally, it could be more fun and could have given him a higher rating, maybe as high as eight.
