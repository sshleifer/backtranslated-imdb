The movie was horrible. The theater was dead silent because everyone was ashamed to be there seeing so much garbage. I think someone did a lobotomy for Jet Li and had him interpret a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old boy. The martial arts are "good", but when you put them together with the films of Jackie Chan and "The Matrix", it is better that you see one of those.
