This movie is not very good. It's boring, and there's not much blood for a horror movie. The plot simply tramples along with not much happening. And I think the vampire woman was so stupid. He had many chances to kill the vampire hunters, since it shows that he has lights as reflections. But, every time he has one of them stuck, he just takes his time and something always happens where he does not bite them. It is not surprising that this has gone directly to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Not as good as the first vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
