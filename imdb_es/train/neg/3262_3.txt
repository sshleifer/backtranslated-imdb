I was lucky to meet George Pal (and I still have my DS: TMOB sign autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the launch, and I asked him why he chose to do the "camp" of the film. Before I could answer, two studio flacks intercepted me and gave me a lecture about how the studio "knew better" and how "no one will take a movie like that". He had been reading the reprints of Bantam for a couple of years thanks to a friend (the ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will remember Blackhawk and his band, I was in a couple of years with him), and had more hope than the ones we got. . <br /> <br /> The flacks insisted that a great adventure would not take place seriously, so doing the 'camp' was the only way. Several other fans jumped by my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the small event, Pal approached us and apologized, wishing we could have done more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie to blacks, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could easily have been the next big movie franchise ... if there were not been for the flacks. <br /> <br /> Boot Doc's memory or story, and the movie would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But destroying the legacy in that way was no less abominable than killing a baby in the crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen and survive the inevitable mis-informed comparisons with Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness to regain the glory we should expect from the First American Superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, there were simultaneous images, but mostly shots were taken and very little with the actors. And, yes, there is a sheet of Ron Ely jumping on a brick wall and shooting something on his shoulder with a specially constructed brass gun. Ely is wearing a feather duster on a white shirt with buttons and a bronze tie, and the words "SAVING THE DOC: ARCHEEMIA OF EVIL ... Coming soon summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the scholars who accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego were for the convention, hit the idiots on the side of the head and call them the idiots they are. At that time, they made dorkknobs and Fu Manchu with striped and baggy canvas pants, and carried Paramount wallets.
