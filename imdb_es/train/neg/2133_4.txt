First things first: I'm not a conservative. And although I would never refer to myself as a Liberal or a Democrat, from the first day I opposed the war in Iraq. I think it's safe to say that John Cusack and I would probably meet face to face in politics, in fact, I'm sure we would become friends if we ever got to talking about how good Adam's BBC documents are. Curtis. My point is this: do not discredit this review thinking that I am not part of the chorus that Cusack is preaching at War, Inc. There is no doubt that WI's policy is designed to attract my demographic, but the problem is that the Adaptation is unsatisfactory and the film that Cusack co-wrote, produced and starred in, fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved, certainly had every intention of making a film against the war as scathing and funny as M * A * S * H ​​by Robert Altman, unfortunately for the viewer. they ended up with one as ingenious and unintelligent as the Canadian Bacon of Michael Moore. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and the "effort" of war are already absurd and, as a result, tragic and pathetic. and, unfortunately comical, just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: you can not write such funny stuff as what the Bush administration gives us every day, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that it feels like it was arming in a hurry. To achieve this, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the stage and crowded into a shopping list of ideas taken from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas get in the throat in the first twenty minutes of the movie and what makes them so annoying is that none of the jokes or deliberately obvious jokes or references to Halliburton, the neoconservatives and the US occupation of Iraq are imaginative . , smart or funny. The writers are so blinded by their own dogma that they felt that simply by referring to these themes, the film would be fun and subversive. The problem is ... it is not. At this point, these ideas are yesterday's news and, unless you've been living underneath or rocked or blinded by ignorance, denial and stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), these jokes are insultingly simple. <br /> <br /> Maybe WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and full of detailed research / ideas about the Occupation. As it is, the jokes and the jokes in sight are superficial and so bad, with so little delicacy, subtlety or satirical evil, that they did little more than make me moan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny because it's true" and The Daily Show proves it every night; However, War, Inc. proves that just because it's true does not make it fun. The bottom line is that hyperbole is not required when it comes to dazzling American / neoconservative politics ... it's a big enough joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
