The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of its followers so that it can punish all those involved in the desecration of its tomb. The transfer of soul causes the youth to age at a tremendous rate until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, blood is drained from those involved in the excavation. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, the Pharaoh's Curse is a pretty lackluster affair. Although the film presents some original and good ideas (blood sucking mummies, transfer of souls, interesting make-up effects, the arm extraction scene, etc.) and some atmospheric moments, the direction and the rhythm are the very definition of the laborious To make matters worse, the first 15 minutes of relatively short duration of 66 minutes of the film consist of nothing but filler. I usually go for these mummies movies in slow motion, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot I wish the film had focused more on his mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the script. Finally, I do not know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what seems to be a pajama, but it's a ridiculous and ridiculous look for a creature that is supposed to instill fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my comments, mostly negative, about the Pharaoh's curse, I will qualify it as 4/10. It's not a good grade to be sure, but it's generous given all the problems I have with the movie.
