The movie started pretty well. He was hit by a bright green meteorite, obtaining superpowers (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, the ability to talk with dogs, super speed, heat vision and the ability to make plants grow big and fast), and fighting crime. From there, everything is downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man gets a disguise from his mother, fights with resident gangs and has many abortive encounters with gang leaders that serve to prepare you for the disappointing and prolonged and an amazing ending. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if it were not like watching a boxing match in which the two fighters intend to hit each other while the audience looks ahead while the fighters just keep on dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all this nonsense, the movie has good points. It says clearly that if you try to face only one gang, they will go back to your house and they will hurt you. He says that gangs and communities need to see their real enemies (the big bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people in a ghetto existence). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community to destroy the predators that harm them. The only message that is really missing is that voters must ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush) are not criminals either. <br /> <br />
