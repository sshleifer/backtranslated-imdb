Yesterday I rented this movie and I can hardly express my disappointment for little Laura Ingalls for getting involved in something so badly produced. I'm not sure if it was a horrible script, a bad address or both, but it leaves a viewer very disappointed to have wasted the time to watch this avalanche. It consisted of a weak and naive plot, very poor lines, and was based solely on beautiful landscapes, and beautiful people to sell them. Unfortunately this was not enough. It would be better to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time in this garbage. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pathetic role as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard to do nothing, anyone who has been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from Los Angeles and not by someone with much knowledge of the world. .
