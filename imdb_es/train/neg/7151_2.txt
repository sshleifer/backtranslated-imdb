I am proud to say that I have seen the three Fast and Furious films. Sure, the plots are a bit silly, and they can be a little cheesy, but I love the car chases, and all the beautiful cars, and the midnight clandestine races. And I will gladly see a fourth. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know what is the difference between those three and Redline? The plot of decent performance, something thought, even if they are potboilers, and last but not least, the directors that I have an idea. All three were made by very competent directors, all took the films in a different direction, just as exciting. It seems that the producer Redline chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the casting couch and turned them into extras. , then picked up their clues from the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script. Yike.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad. This is 70 made for bad TV movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had some great cars, but you really can not see many in action, and the action is so misguided that you can not get excited about the chases, if the cars do not thrill you, Why go to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a group of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing out loud. I have dirty looks, but this was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> Rent the F & F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go to a kart track and compete on your own. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
