All I can really say is that I'm glad I was knitting socks while watching the movie, or I would be very upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. The performance was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that had to be serious in which my husband and I laughed out loud. I recommend this movie to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
