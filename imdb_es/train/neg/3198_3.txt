In short, the film had a bit of a weak first act with a bit of forced action and a somewhat unrelated rhythm and rhythm, a decent second act that managed to generate some tension and intrigue despite an inconsistent rhythm and some inferior performances by the Cast, and the third act ... there was virtually NO third act! <br /> <br /> Regarding the third act, the film ends abruptly. There is no resolution or path to the climax of the second act, so there was not much of a third act. The bad guys die and that's it; the final credits roll. There is nothing that shows what happens with the protagonist and the secondary characters, etc. The audience would probably have left the theater after the movie, asking "is that all?" A real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell, who performed well enough to serve the film most of the time, but it certainly is not at all outstanding. It is only functional, but it achieves this by being merely generic and derived. It is also evident that the score is VERY up-to-date with the use of timpani synthesized for some percussions. What impressed me the least about the score is that some tense moments announce musical signals that seem to have been cheated by James Horner of "48 HRS". and "Command", particularly bronze. <br /> <br /> In general, the film had potential, since the basic story itself is good, but the execution was mediocre with a mediocre direction, a weak performance and a somewhat inconsistent rhythm. br /> <br /> There was practically no third act to finish the story correctly, and this omission is important and unforgivable, since it does not allow the film to end satisfactorily. This could be the script or, possibly, the production had to cut the filming or editing of the third act in the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating on why there is no third act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt end really hurts the movie in general. <br /> <br /> This is good for a view if you are curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap, as well as to know the reason why you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write scripts and you make movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs.
