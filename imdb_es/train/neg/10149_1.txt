I can not believe that Steven Segal's career has played so low that it has been reduced to making 4th grade movies with secondary actors of 5th grade. I watched this movement waiting to see it leave some people the way it normally does. When it comes down to using a single judo cut between the shoulder blades to eliminate an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is amazing like a movie, and even if you apologize for the images, and you read this story like a novel, you would be left wondering why you had picked up the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal follows the movements and it seems as if he is. Only doing this because he is under obligation. It does not show any effort or enthusiasm, and in some scenes it does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat other people's comments, but the use of footage for cut scenes and for images of Aircraft in flight are pathetic. The state of these scenes is shaky, unstable and the scenes seem to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder movie that shows how President John F. Kennedy is assassinated is more constant and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My sincere opinion is to tell you not to waste time watching this movie, it is not up to the standards of your work in The Man's Flash or Exit Wounds. I read a review that said the movie had a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal was paid 5 of that) and that the film was still under budget. I must agree. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder that this is a direct DVD movie, since no theater owner of conscience would play this movie.
