If Mr. Cranky had qualified this, he would be tempted to copy his review and paste it here. But since he has not done it, I'll have to try it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this film a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's performance is excellent. However, even he can not save this movie from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on it because it's just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity, reminiscent of the bad movies of the 70s. Worse still, both the actors and the director seemed to be inventing As they progressed, which probably proved how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the story, although it revolves around a future Corporation called Proxate Corporation, which brought together a crew of expendable people to transport a dangerous cargo in an old container / slave ship to Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a baby kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew through USB 12 or something like that. The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation since the entertainment value of this movie is on par with an exam of the same name. <br /> <br /> Honestly I can not find a scene that could say that it was good He made and made any real sense in the context of the movie. I only saw it until the end, since I had some bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people who were actually worse than me, in particular Malcolm McDowall. I will not hold this against him, since he is a great actor and all the great actors are entitled to a bad movie in his career and this is a double. <br /> <br /> Therefore, unless this is your only movie. Buy, rent or be male and your doctor is not doing prostate exams this week and somehow feels that this is a bad thing, then give this a really wide place unless, of course, if it is really a community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a roller coaster.
