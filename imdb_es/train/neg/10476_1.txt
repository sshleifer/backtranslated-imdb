I'm Christian. However, I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians. As a general rule, they are "knowledge" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a horrible job of it. The acting was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some way, I COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to convey. Not only was the film made tremendously, but the people who made it even had some erroneous facts. However, in this "critical", those facts are irrelevant and too deep to deepen them. In short, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for the comic relief of the daily routine.
