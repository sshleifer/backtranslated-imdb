This is a typical late Universal Horror movie: it is technically competent, even if it seems, with a cookie cutout plot and a bit of serious overestimation. The most interesting part of this movie is the cast of doubles by Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the "monster" of the film. It is sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money he was paid. Hatton is less frightening than the study expected, since he most often felt sorry for fear or even hatred. Martin Koslack is on board as the crazy artist of the movie, and it's very funny in this part. For my part, I enjoy seeing Koslack in almost anything; For some reason, man entertains me. The only other part of the movie that entertained me is the absurd take on the film in the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is next to the male "hero" of the movie, who is an "artist" who paints ... get this ... paint girls. In some way, the work of our hero is reviewed together with the absurd sculpture of the villain. The main critic of the film is also funny, who at one point says that he despises the pin-up of the hero because "women do not exist like that" to which our heroine responds with the certainty that the critic does not leave enough. . Finally, there is a bit of a minor argument about the domestication of heroin (which is also an art critic) by the main man ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. In general, this movie is a pretty mediocre image with some fun elements.
