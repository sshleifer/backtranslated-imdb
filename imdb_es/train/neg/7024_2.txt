I borrowed this film because not only because its gay theme, but the idea of ​​role playing really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised to be filmed in San Francisco since I live near San Francisco. And, of course, it was nice to see photos of the Castro district (although the Castro for me really is more suited for gay men than for women). But other than that, I really can not recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the "role play" I was already bored. And the role scenes I saw were a bit embarrassing to watch. The acting leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I did not finish the movie. I would skip this one.
