I bought this video in the $ 1 Walmart container. I think I overpaid! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of third-rate films for small studios (in this case, Monogram, which made most of the Bowry Boys films). While the misery of most of these films does not come close to the level of horror that their latest film (the "classics" of Ed Wood, such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space) achieved, they are nevertheless bad movies and they must be avoided by everyone. but the most diehard fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie addict, so I tried this. Also, some of these minor films were actually pretty good, but not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather strange and violent wife alive through a serum. he invents young brides. They never really explained WHY they should be girlfriends or why they should be women or even what illness their wife had, so they can see that the plot was never really a problem. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a really annoying reporter (type Lois Lane without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were STOLEN! Then, she follows some clues to Lugosi's door. The house of Lugosi is complete with his crazed wife, a female attendant and two strange people who are apparently the children of the assistant (an ugly sex fan and a dwarf). Naturally, this brave reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film: apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Eventually, all maniacs die, mainly due to their own hands and all is well. At the conclusion, the journalist and a doctor who just met decided to get married. And, of course, the reporter's silent cameraman faints when this happens. If you have not noticed, there are many faints in this movie. Or, maybe because it was such a slow and heavy movie that they fell asleep.
