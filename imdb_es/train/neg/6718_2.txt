I wanted to see the movie for an article in a film magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The story is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting was horrible! I had the feeling of watching a movie that made a lot of fans. Although the movie began in a promising way, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with uncomfortable characters. I still think it's worth seeing, since I have not seen movies that feature gay pornography. However, do not keep your expectations high, you will be very disappointed. * outside *****
