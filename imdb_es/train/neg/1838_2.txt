"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are unpleasant characters. That's not the problem. They are unpleasant and do not interest us at all. "The War of the Roses" presented unpleasant characters, but due to the right presentations, we grew up to be at least interested in their destiny, while in "Envy" the introduction is thin, the characters are never credible and the plot only It makes things worse. . <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I am a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller did a campaign to launch this directly to the video and now I can see why. The film proposes that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we received images that seem to indicate that Stiller hates Black. I thought this would become a kind of one-sided relationship (to the "The Cable Guy") but never does, instead, Stiller insists he is his "best friend" and I felt confused as he seemed to treat Black as Well, "poo" The plot of the movie is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it's supposed to be a story of exaggerated morality. Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance, but Black is discreet and annoying (and I usually find it very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for this. It is not one of the worst movies of all time, but it could certainly be much better. . I wish there was Va-Poo-Rize, so we could make this movie disappear forever ...
