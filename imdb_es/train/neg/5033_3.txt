The murders are happening in a desert city in Texas. Who is responsible? Small novelties of mystery and racial tensions (the latter really does not fit), but otherwise strictly for fans of the slasher, who will appreciate blood and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from Friday the 13th of the infamy of PART 3) plays an almost detective teenager. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: R rating for Violence and Gore, nudity, and some language.
