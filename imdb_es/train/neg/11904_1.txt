The end of the violence and, certainly, the Million Dollar Hotel insinuated the idea that Wenders has lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving image. The Land of Plenty seals the coffin, I fear, for being a very unimaginative, obviously sentimental and clich√© movie. The characters are completely flat and stereotyped, the writing, the plot and the direction are, at best, amateur. For the first time in a long time, I was impatient for the film to end in order to continue my life. The delirium of the uncle torn by war, the patriotic abstract that looks at the sky to the conclusion ... everything seemed so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a filmmaker who once did some convincing magic on the screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, perceptive writing and interesting shooting possibilities have been left behind, I'm afraid. Hopefully I will find your inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw the film, Wenders was there to present it. Lacking humility, he offered the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I KNOW you will enjoy the next two hours". I'm afraid I could not be more wrong ...
