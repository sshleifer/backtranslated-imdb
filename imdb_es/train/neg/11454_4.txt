So I had little expectation to start with this movie, but it did not fulfill that. While there were some funny parts, including one or two sound parts, this movie was not as good as what I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and they ended quickly, leaving us sitting down "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were some jokes that went on again and again. The part where the mountain falls made me yawn. In addition, the edition was really deficient. There were some deficient scene transitions, but that seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but I would not see it again, and I'm glad I expected it. Give it a chance, you could enjoy it, but do not think you'll find anything like the 40-year-old virgin, or Superbad.
