This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I really wanted to see this movie, given the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see the Three Friends than see this movie again. Quickly passed the DVD player directly to the trash. My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie, however, you probably also liked New Coke. I can not see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it's slow, boring and it does not have a real plot. You wait 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand that this was done in 1976, however, this was a time of bad television everywhere. Thank God Disc and Three's Company have disappeared along with the stop signs and the Bay City Rollers. Oh well, just my thoughts.
