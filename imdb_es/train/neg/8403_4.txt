I gave this to four purely out of its historical context. He was considered lost for many years until he unexpectedly appeared on Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Moe is the straight guy and Larry and Curly act like a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not sure because the plot was so minimal that nothing really stays in my memory. I vaguely remember that it is a western musical comedy. Even the Stooge seem to be going through the motions. In general, there is not much to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, do not worry. If you're a Stooge fan, stay with the shorts.
