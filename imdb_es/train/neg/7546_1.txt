I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought I'd work in a movie like this. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it should not be bad to see it at least once ... but trust me, it is. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the old movie. .but why would they want to remake a movie like this one? The very basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is whether it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This movie does not fall under any of them and it's still stupid. I kept watching the movie with the hope that it would become interesting at some point, but it never does. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a big no, not so much for horror movie fans as it is for Cage fans. You could probably appear on television.
