But, let's face it ... they took me a few nostalgic sighs. <br /> <br /> The show is so consistently good that you can have some setbacks. I have a new season, and I simply seized them as if I had 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​finishing it, but it was much more an episode of end of season that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> It is supposed that Dr.Cox is not bald for a couple of episodes, The only explanation it occurs to me is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, is the reason why the cox of hell is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is amazing ... it brings the seventh season.
