A spy mystery somewhat uncomfortable with a predictable plot about the dangers of World War II. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. Raymond Massey does the best acting, since Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned evil. He is the head of a spy network that tries to get information from Jane amnesia, coded information related to allied activities. Will she tell him? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (like Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice of Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is disastrous. It seems so embezzled that casting has to be classified as one of the worst in the history of cinema. It is unfortunate that such a talented actor is involved in a role that does not suit his talents. The film is worth a look, despite being half spy and half gangster movie, and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters. It is easy to forget about this, amnesia is not necessary.
