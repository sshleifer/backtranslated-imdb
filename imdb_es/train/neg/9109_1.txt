The first cruel intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how the hell could they make such a bad sequel? Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this, Amy Adams sucks. She is terrible And could not they have found a girl who really looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color! already then. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. The Sebastian in the first film is tortuous, deceptive and much more evil than Sebastian in the prequel. And what about the story line? Basically, it's like that ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the movie says that, although he does not mention anything about him and his life as a couple, and how he has been with him. Girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York, and suddenly decides that he is going to turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (I must remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle Giller says: "You broke with the FIRST PERSON you always loved because I said: how could he have been in love in the prequel?" ???). And he is nice and charming, and all "good person", when he rejects the sex of the girl that his father was doing. <br /> <br /> 3- It makes a total of 180, and ends in a trio at the end of the movie, and then seduces Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's terrible. And I loved the first one so much. I have not even seen the third yet. I hope God is better than this prequel.
