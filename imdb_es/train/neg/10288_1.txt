First of all, I just want to say that I LOVE this show !!! But this episode ... this episode becomes a mockery of the entire program. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they tried to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the WORST episode in the whole series. <br /> <br /> No argument, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... they suck. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "how the furlings look" creating that stupid "previously in ..." ...... is simply shameful. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really very bad.
