To be honest, I am surprised by the positive feedback that this film has received. The movie only lasts throughout its 81-minute lifetime, and the audience has to suffer all the time. Actually there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. He is given a rather pathetic dialogue and manages it quite well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough clock. I guess the highlight of his performance is seeing the guy lying on the beach wearing chummies with tiger drawings ... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us a boring and pathetic description of a vampire who suffers and misses the day (to see a much more compelling interpretation of the vampire who suffers, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves very slowly and is only positively marked by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. Honestly, this movie can only be recommended to Charlie Spradling fans (which I am, and I still had a hard time watching it!).
