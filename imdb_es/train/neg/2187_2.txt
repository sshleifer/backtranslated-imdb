I bought this movie on DVD to get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo can be seen, because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story that one can follow and some actors who can act, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring, I have firmly confirmed that I will never see her again without Tom, Crow and Mike. However, as summarized above, it was better than the movie that was featured in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
