I saw mom ... well, she was not exactly kissing Santa Claus; He has his hand on his thigh and his evil thoughts in mind. <br /> <br /> This was enough to emotionally scare a child who wanted to believe. He grew up and became a bitter man who was upset by the quality of the toys that were made and by the lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> Waiting for a real slasher movie, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people die, and there was no nudity at all. What annoying <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie, but it was too slow and I really did not have a good script. I did not expect a great performance, but I sure wanted some action. There simply was not any.
