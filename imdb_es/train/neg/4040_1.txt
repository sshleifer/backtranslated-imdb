I consider myself a bit of a snob when it comes to everything, and although the film experience is more suited to explosions than to drama, I can also be very obsessed with movies. <br /> <br /> Not everything Art films, however, are better than King Kong. Possibly I would give Kong two stars, double the tour of this movie. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that people were very enthusiastic about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a work. For the less demanding art lovers, a film that looks like a play is a "great art". <br /> <br /> This movie, however, was useless. <br /> <br /> There was almost no story So it was based on the great drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall from the ceiling or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Hardly. <br /> <br /> To be overly fair: some of the landscapes were interesting, however: communist flats, views of the city (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams still in service.
