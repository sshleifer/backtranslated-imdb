There are some movies that you only know are going to be bad from the first frame. Even if you do not remember Ed Wood's work, look at the commentator on "Plan 9 from outer space" and simply KNOW that you will not see the next cinematic masterpiece. So, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls' masterpiece, "House of Dead," with that guy sitting in the front of the house starting his introduction while desperately trying to sound like he had just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm on a hellish journey. <br /> <br /> Then, the movie starts like this: first the main character says that everyone else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he begins to present the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... think it's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia ... my ex ... we broke recently ... I had to study and she had to surround". No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this group of twenty-somethings who could not get out of a wet paper bag will go to the "Rave of the century", a rave in question are a few tents, a potty and a poor quality scenario located on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang lost the ferry, but fortunately you will find a way to get there, like being a fishing boat run by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Do you understand? The man who wrote this script is a genius) and his partner, who is a bastard. son of Cpt McAllister of Simpsons and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To summarize, the gang arrives on the island, does not find anyone there, except some bloody shirts and then decides to flee away from there. No, wait, they do not, they really get happy and like there's free alcohol. <br /> <br /> With that scene, the film reaches the bottom and then, against all odds, goes further down. Some guys in rubber suits start running, there are some screams and gunshots, our gang goes to a house to meet another gang, they leave the house, they meet Cpt Kirk and a policewoman (who among them have around 500 pounds). of weapons) and then decides to return to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the boys in the rubber suit begin to multiply as bacteria and I start to cry because I really paid to see this. To add insults to the injury, every few minutes there are shots of the video game on which this shit is based and there is a nice scene game about some characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit into the famous category "So bad that it's good". It is simply bad. The script is bad, the zombies are horrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie just for its Reputation of being horrible. Do not do it. There are bad movies that deserve to be seen. This is not one of them.
