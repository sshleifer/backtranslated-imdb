An interesting change from the first. There was more mystery in this movie than the first. Even when it's over, you wonder what happened who was the killer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts slow and then in the last half the pace speeds up. The whole movie is nice. The story is 22 years after the events that occurred in the first film, Norman Bates came out of an asylum and returned to the Bates motel, but when a woman appears who claims to be his real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins plays again with an old Norman and the scene at the end was excellent, he turned that terribly strong sword.
