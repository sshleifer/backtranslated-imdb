First of all, I'm not easily scared by ... Anything except for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not appropriate for children at all! My mouth was open all the time, it just surprised me. I could not believe how bloody it was for a children's movie, the bunnies were brutally murdered! It is unnecessary to be so horrible and have a grade of G. I recommend having more than 8 to see this. But do not get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I was not mentally marked as a child. I can not believe that a father allows, say, a 4-year-old child to see this. It is only for small, intense and complicated children, so as not to forget them. I am over 4 years old and I was surprised by the violence. I do not recommend
