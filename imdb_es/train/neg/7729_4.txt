A wonderful television miniseries completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to pass herself off as a naive 16 year old! Without exaggerating, that is the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film begins just before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This TV miniseries is really the most classic example of the title of this post and to which I refer every time the subject arises. <br /> <br /> That alone makes this completely impossible to see, even though it is one of the best 'global' dramas of the Second World War that TV has produced. If he has a stomach, or a decent fast forward, he could enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by some of the comments that refer to the love story (intentional pun). Did you watch the movie with your eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and their "selective vision"? I'm also a Boomer, so do not think for a second that I'm a central young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS ARRIVE 45. Get used to it. Deal with him. Age with grace, damn it. <br /> <br /> The Winds of War could have been ... so good. How much more would we be talking about this miniseries today, some 25 years later, if a REAL talent had been created in such an important and critical role? At this time, with the constant distraction of the old fans, that only nullifies most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.
