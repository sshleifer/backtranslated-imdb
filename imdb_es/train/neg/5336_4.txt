This movie is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've seen. It has very little plot, mostly partying, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. You could say that Elvis was also wasted, he is much, much better in "Follow That Dream".
