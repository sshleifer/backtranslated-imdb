This Worldwide was the cheap version of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions did in the 1980s at the "Big 3" stations located during the Saturday morning / afternoon fight mania. When Ted Turner got his hands on the failed NWA version of Crockett, he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and proceeded to remove all NWA references. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were re-labeled with the WCW logo and moved to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, and eventually became nothing more than recaps for WCW's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last program of the WCW under Turner to broadcast the weekend of the purchase of the WCW of Vince McMahon and WWF. Currently, the entire NWA World Wide Video Archive / WCW Video Archive along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library in general are in the vaults of the WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
