Wow ... I can not believe how bad it is ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3). I listened to the rumors, I read the criticisms, but I had to decide for myself. Well, let me tell you - SUEVA! The worst performance of any movie ever made, the dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and ridiculous, does not have a perceptible plot, a "cinematography" that my grandmother seems to have filmed with her camcorder, accessories of weapons that are not kidding - made of aluminum foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and swords foil. Two of the captives are released along with a rebel from the island's fanatics, and they are given an advantage of one day before being hunted down by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's almost all ... <br /> <Sincerely, this is one of the films of THE WORST that I have had the misfortune to submit to me too. The budget had to be around $ 200 and was spent entirely on the Gore FX (which was not really a bad idea ...). There is NOTHING in ZOMBIE DOOM other than a ridiculous gore scene with a lot of HORRIBLY dialogues dubbed. This movie makes other exits without a budget like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING MAD seems TITANIC. Some can classify ZD in the category of "so bad, it's good", and I suppose if you're REALLY drunk or drugged and looking at it with some friends in the MST3K style, I think you could look like that. But not for me. I hated almost everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally frightening and is included as a "bonus" in the ZD release of Shock-O-Rama) is indicative of other works by Andreas Schnaas, then he should be forbidden to have anything that Do with making a movie never again under pain of death. There's a fun kung fu battle in the second half of the movie, and a lot of blood, so I'll give him a very generous 3/10. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
