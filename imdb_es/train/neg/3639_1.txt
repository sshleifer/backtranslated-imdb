This movie stinks from the beginning to (especially) the end. Probably do not get worse, acting, history, photography, camera work, etc., everything is very bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that is what makes it a "big" watch, It will give you more than enough good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people thought when making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is ridiculously ridiculous, it's more like a comedy in disguise, something like Mafia, also meaningless, but very funny. <br /> <br /> And take care of the end of the movie ... uhum.
