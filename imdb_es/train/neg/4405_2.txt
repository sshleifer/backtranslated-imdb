All I can say is that before I saw the film, I did not have a clue to indicate who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I have to confess that the movie was not a help in reaching this data. .. and I did not even succeed in persuading me to do an investigation by writing some words on the Google website; however, all I can say is that the actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute facial expression, she really played well and showed a state of mind of deep depression, as she really is. <br /> <br /> After all, based on The script of the film has happened in Turkey and Tehran, as well as in Afghanistan. But believe me, I'm familiar with the area, it was an Arabian desert in Morocco. The Turkish and Persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in a language that is not Arabic ... <br /> <br /> I suppose that to make a film like this, documentary type, a thorough investigation is obligatory about all these minor elements.
