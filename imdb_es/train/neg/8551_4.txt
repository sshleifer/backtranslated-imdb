It is 1982, two years after the siege of the Iranian embassy that involved the dramatic rescue of the Balcones del SAS, and a war with Argentina in the Malvinas Islands that is currently taking place, what better film than a Gung- Ho "SAS" re-creates the siege of Iranian hostages, while we use Britains' number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. cast Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and you will have a winner in your hands ... Well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the performance is quite second. It's like a long episode of "The Professionals", but without the formula. This movie is not going anywhere and it is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli saw this movie and decided to get rid of Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. See if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS in General, if not, save time.
