And that's the only reason why I own this DVD. Now I have not seen the first Nemesis movie, but I did verify the information and said: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was male. But again, the first one looked at the future, so maybe this Alex is completely new and the scientist has just turned Alex into a woman this time. Who knows, at least he was not approached in any way in the movie. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or whatever you want, as it was, that is, in the future) escapes with his mother on a special boat and ends in the 80s in Africa. There mom is murdered and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then, the tribe is killed by a cyborg of the future and then Alex runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. Therefore, there. It sounds familiar, right? <br /> <br /> Terminator is not the only movie recorded here, Predator also has its fair share and I think that Fly's first film, Vincent Price, is special nomination to give a solid base to build your cyborgs head . <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Granted, the movie was a fairly standard low budget movie, but it had bad special effects for a movie in the mid-90s. It would have looked good for an 80s movie like never before. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is just interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most horrible piece of cinema I've had the pleasure of seeing (?), But it's very close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because let's be honest here. : Did anyone expect performances worthy of Oscar here? Oh, well ... at least I found Sue Price in the fashion of the Amazonian warriors. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals with respect to quality in general. And despite the very basic plot, the film itself does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> Rating of a camp movie: 4/10 I had occasional laughs because of the sheer wickedness of the movie, so it does not matter. He deserves it.
