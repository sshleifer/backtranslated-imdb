OK, I captured this movie halfway, but.oh.dear.god.it.sonidos.me gusta.est√°n.all.read.the.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially that guy who is now in Masters and the Book Group, although at least he has shown that he can act if he wishes! (The part where someone suffers a heart attack stands out as a bastion of the bad movie, both in terms of acting and writing and general plausibility). It seems clearly that it is a trade in people, but that is not the best. film always, is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of serious and hopeless GCSE students trying to get a passing grade. Not as much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car accident!
