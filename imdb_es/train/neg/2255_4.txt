Was this movie stupid? Yep. This depth of the movie? No Character development? Do not trace turns? No This was simply a movie about a highly fictional Springer show. It shows the length that some people will take to get their cups on television. Molly Hagan did a great job as the mother of Jaime Pressly. Jaime is ... well ... GORGEOUS! This movie was not made to be a "breakthrough" movie, but was meant for life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone otherwise, all the girls get pregnant with different types, and they all drive rusty Ford '66 trucks (exaggeration, of course, but that's the image that everyone sees when you mention the "caravan park"). Some people analyze the movies too much (case in point: Star Trek fans). I watch movies purely for the value of entertainment; I do not want to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the "Goofs" fragment on Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better? Of course, it was fun as hell.
