"Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), along with his friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the "Scooter" (David Gore) are always hungry children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages your dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic journey on the launch pad near where the three are. <br /> <br /> The first thing we notice is the animation of the movie. I found it very well done. The stage had depth, since things in the distance really seemed to be behind the focus of the scenes. I did not watch the movie in 3-D, since it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there really was not any scene that took advantage of 3D effects, except for a fight between characters near the end. Nor was I impressed by the design of the characters. For me, they did not look anything like a fly, especially in coloring. The flies were an unusual grayish blue that distracted me a bit. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast were not bad, but they were not good either. There were many times that I focused more on my computer than on the story. The writing was written for a younger audience, with comic moments that will make younger children laugh. I did not see anything for adults, like jokes that they would get the key phrase for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> In this movie the story was not followed. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, since the main focus was flies. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the movie were a work of fiction, and that there were no flies in Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration, however. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is certainly only for children. But, save it for a rainy day.
