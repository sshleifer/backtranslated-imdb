This was an excruciating loss of my time. There is no plot. The performance was well below the level, it should be used as an example in the acting classes of what NOT to do. It is simply a commercial scam from the previous Universal Soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the active barrel. It is sad that you need to affirm your ego every few years, and even sadder is that people will pay a good amount of money to go through that. This kind of stupidity gives Martial Arts movies a bad name. In comparison, it makes Segall, Norris and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe you should take the track of Leslie Nielson and make shipments of your gender. At least then we could be laughing with him instead of him.
