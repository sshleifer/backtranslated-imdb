I agree with the last critic that this movie had a terrible performance. Yes, there was a lot of blood and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow and meaningless plot and a mute end. Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway: in a Chinatown or in Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing that in its place. A technical annoyance that I had with the DVD is that if you turn off the subtitles in Spanish, they come back after some scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, do not waste your time in the deleted scenes because there is no audio and it only looks like tourist images.
