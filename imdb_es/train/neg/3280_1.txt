I will not go and I will give you my 10 dollars. I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children enjoy it and can see it without me worrying about what they are seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks that the previews are ridiculous and prefer to see the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy, in fact, she thinks she looks more like a whore than a Margarita Duque. Those shorts that might as well not wear anything. And since when American Pie has something to do with the Dukes SHAME ON of them for putting that nasty line on having sex with a car. That in itself should have got the film a rating of R. The only good thing that could come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals. Allow everyone hope. So the people who went to see the movie will see how it should have looked.
