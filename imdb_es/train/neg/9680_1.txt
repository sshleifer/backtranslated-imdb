Greenaway seems to have the habit of deliberately trying to displease his viewers. This film begins with incest, and intentionally, without meaning, casual incest. That is Greenaway's big problem. Prefers saloon tricks to surprise those who do something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. It is a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.
