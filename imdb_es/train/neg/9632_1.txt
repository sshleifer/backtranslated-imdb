I have a horrible videotape of "Boom!", And I want to see it in all its widescreen. So I voted "1" and I hope you do too. Together, we can take this film to the cinematic scum pits, and hope that someone sees an opportunity for BIG MONEY by launching "Boom!" in its Extended Version of the Director. The movie is one of my favorite howls: you only look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman and you say to yourself: "Yes, I guess you can fool some people for a long time." Producers considering the DVD release of "Boom!" you should bear in mind that, in all the places where it has been shown, there have been crowds full in theaters. But it has not been until Frostbite Falls yet.
