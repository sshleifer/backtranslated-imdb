This movie was so bad that I had to overtake most of it to get to the good parts. Hah what good bits? The only thing that was worth it was the end (those who have seen the movie will know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie as if an underworld were in the dawn of the dead and Freddy against Jason, but what I got was this shit. The story was forgettable, the cast was misused and what the director thought when he did this. This could have been great, but it turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. Okay, what if there was a bit of T and A? I was behind the blood and it disappointed me bitterly. Do not expect a movie that is good, but if you want horrible horror, then look at this and see how a horror movie SHOULD NOT BE DONE.
