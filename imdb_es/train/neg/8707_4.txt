This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life. I rented it as a joke, hoping to laugh at the first scenes, and let me say that I have never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene in which the ninjas randomly jump out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous shooting is one of the most incredibly funny and stupid action movie moments of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but rather a movie that makes fun (and means nothing) of the action genre. I did not see the first two, but judging from the complexity of the plot, I do not think I've overlooked that much. If you want to see a movie that goes well with a six-pack or any herbal remedy, then I urge you to rent this film and sit down and watch the 100 years of film breakthroughs, throw you away and the carosours
