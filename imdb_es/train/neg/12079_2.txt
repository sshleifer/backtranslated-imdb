Poor Will would be rolling in his grave if he could this classic television adaptation of his classic game. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. A set, a walkway, a walkway and some columns placed at random pass as a set. The film was ineptly dubbed into English, and the actors of the English voice sometimes murmured their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and sad feeling. And where was Fonterbras in this movie? MST3K gave this unfortunate production the treatment it deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this movie had never been in the first place.
