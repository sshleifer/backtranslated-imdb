I just can not understand why all these relics from Ceausescu's time refuse to let go. One can see clearly how frustrated they were during the community censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their films, and now they imagine what great artistic freedom is, so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other type of falsity imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, David Lynch, Forman and neorealism and other filmmakers who could work with an aesthetic of ugliness. THOSE people were dominating their jobs - well, you do not! Do us a favor, all of you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other obsolete old people, and leave us alone! It's a short time to see some Romanian MOVIES on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! You are not directors, you are ILLITERATED !!!
