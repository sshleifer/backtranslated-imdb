Haunting is another horror remake with exaggerated fake special effects and a large cast of favorites on the screen and has no redeeming qualities at all, except perhaps for cinematography. Yes, the remakes are not all bad, but the remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are. I guess the actors on the A list (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, the ridiculous special effects and the terrible attempts to scare the audience. However, this is a movie, not a tabloid magazine. It does not matter who cares about the characters and the story. Two things were lost in this movie. The story is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and extracting four chapters and then using what remains for the film is so boring and a lot of that is inexplicable. The characters are quite thin and while the acting is good, you really do not care about any of the characters. Lily Taylor gives a horrible performance and sounds like she's 8 years old. She's old when she writes her lines without mentioning how horrible she is. Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a group of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat man dressed like a grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine. There is a creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and is not funny without wanting, just sad. The house is beautiful and well designed, it is probably the only positive thing about this movie that looks good but does not save it from everything brutal. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV at no cost so it would have been even more expensive if I had paid to see it, but luckily I was on Scream Channel. In general, The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
