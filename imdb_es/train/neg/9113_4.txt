They had so much potential for this movie and they completely collapse. In the first cruel intentions, we ask ourselves what motivated the main characters to become the way they are and act as they do. There is almost no development of any character in this prequel. Actually it's a very sad story, but this movie did not do anything for me. It was as if they had omitted good writing instead of unnecessary words. And the end does not make any sense and does not explain anything. The writing was simply terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at least 3 of the same lines that were in the original. Like "down boy", or the kiss scene, and some others that I can not remember. I was not impressed by Robin's performance, but Amy did a great job. That's the only thing that reconciled this movie.
