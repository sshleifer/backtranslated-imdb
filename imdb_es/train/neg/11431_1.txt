It is important not to feel insulted by the lack of logic or common sense, and those who have some "gray matter" will agree that this movie simply does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems are in the direction, cast Selections and lack of depth in the construction of the character. The word comedy was something very difficult to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, in the mid-30s, seem to be well adapted. They meet a complete stranger in a park and the character of Heather Graham approaches her and asks the most intimate questions that even a person in his right mind would run to the other side or, at least, shout to an officer of police. Then she approaches awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and she falls in love with him. Then, after ONE date, they all go out together, he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Las Vegas in a week. Hi, does anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out with thousands of women and meets a person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it just does not make sense. Of course it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather falls madly with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more, to the point where it was the most careless kiss that chemistry COULD be there. I found it unromantic and unromantic, and although many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality is that Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was Sue Kramer's debut as a director and for me it was too much to chew. It would take a lot of work to make this movie work and, in my humble opinion, it could be done with better writers, casting and direction.
