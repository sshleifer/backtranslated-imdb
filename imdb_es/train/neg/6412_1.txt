I just got back from the movie and I'm completely horrified. This movie is an absolute mockery for all humanity. The theater I was in maybe had 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person would like it. I can not believe that any healthy human likes it. There was no plot without a plot at all. That was a joke. How can you make a movie about nothing? This movie only serves to show why Hollywood is in a mess. I can only watch the spiral of the "horror movies" industry and laugh. What a parody to all the filmmakers, this is true for all the new "teen horror movies", Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all that garbage. Do not support this kind of nonsense!
