Be warned <br /> <br /> This is crap that other shit will not even deign to be in company because it's under them! Well, take it out of the way, let me say something more substantive. <br /> <br /> For a long time I've seen Ashes of Time thinking it was a new version of the material based on a Wuxia tome highly revered from a novel because of the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all that, WKW has not managed to adapt the novel on the screen according to many Wuxia fans; Most of the time they are just drops of dripping water, drops of sweat, running horses' feet, etc. I could not see most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I moved many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's films are another shot after hearing many compliments, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express because it is his most accessible film. So wrong! I was just p.o. I was tricked to waste my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothing. Some professional critics mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a great modern city, blah, blah, blah. Everything is fine if the director has a point of view with something to say about why these things happen and tell him. But no, it simply shows what it is. Faye Wong's performance is very typical of Hong Kong style: confusing enunciation, deer in the expression of the wide eye of the lighthouse, trying to be a kind of cute and youthful performance; The rest of the cast has no inspiration either. <br /> <br /> I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director trying something new and different, that should be applauded, but not one that has not. However, I mastered the art of storytelling, which is what Mr. Wong is, for the past 17 years!
