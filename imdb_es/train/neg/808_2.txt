Extremely disappointing film based on the novel by James Michener. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. His southern accent was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when she spoke as she sounded like an old woman from the south who came home to rest. Brando, so good at previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power, in "Witness of the Prosecutor's Office", should have been nominated as best actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, is about the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between American soldiers. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando had a stone face in the whole movie. Your change of anti-these relationships to a professional occurs when you find love with an Asian woman. His emotions and his conversation made it difficult to see how he could adopt these new visions. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received Oscar awards for their performances. Nothing about any of the performances was equally impressive. The appearance of Umeki on the screen was brief and without much of what is shown on his part. Miiko Taka performed better in this film, who behaved very well as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotion as the anti-American who found love with the character of Brando. His face was engraved with the unhappiness he had for having lost his father and his brother in World War 11. He realized that his way of dancing was not out of this living existence. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott left the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the intolerant mother of Brando's love interest at the beginning. His performance together with that of Ricardo Montalb√°n was useless. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
