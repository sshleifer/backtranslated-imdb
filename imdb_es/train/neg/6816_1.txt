I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget movies, so it was not my problem. My problem is that I felt like I was watching my neighbor's next home movie. In my opinion, everything seemed like a guy who wrote a quick story, took a camera and started shooting. I understand how difficult this must be to do it effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I hope to feel like I'm watching some kind of professional movie. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a great resume, He's a great actor, and he was good in this movie. The other people in him were not there. I understand that it should be fun and cheaper to use friends and family as the cast, but it does not serve to convince the acting. It seemed like the way it was filmed, I was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the writing, the plot and the acting are there to begin with, that kind of style is not necessary, and that's the way it is. a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also on a technical level, I had digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all those good cars, when they were scanned slowly, they seemed to shake a little back and forth. The problem is not in my visualization equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonally) but somewhere in the production, I had never seen that kind of artifact in a professional movie made before, then there was the sound. they made voices in off, which may be fine unless it sounds like the track in this movie. "It sounded like the microphone built into the camera.
