It's amazing that this movie turns out to be on one of my playlists after all. It is by far the worst number 1 movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I been so bored before (fortunately not for more than 1.5 hours), the preteen's mood attempts that feature is not close to being, but one of the corners of my mouth It is slightly inclined. After the first uncomfortable part, you tend to expect the other parts to be at least slightly better. You wait in vain, it only goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a story worth telling and repeats this non-story three times. We can only hope that, by some miracle, all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never get his hands on a camera again ...
