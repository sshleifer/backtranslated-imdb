This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. It is (I think) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his hard but fair coach, his girlfriend and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has ongoing nervous breakdowns. The story is not going anywhere, there is no character development, there is no one to worry about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such a horrible movie. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
