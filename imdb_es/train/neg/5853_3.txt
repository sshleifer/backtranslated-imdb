The immortalizer was, uh, interesting. He certainly did not kill me during his hour and a half, but he did not impress me much either. A group of children are kidnapped in an alley by muscle-headed mutants (in a scene with the most compelling head-spinning effect of cinema) and taken to a luxurious house in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for their old and wealthy patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant the brain of an older person into a different body, their new voice will sound exactly like their previous voice? With all this talk about the pineal glands and the use of a bright green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing on the heads of the producers. But production, literally, does not have the guts to achieve it. I never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror movie, it does not pack it with the edge of the frame. The performance is uniformly terrible, with Clarke Lindsley's only good performance as Dr. Price's assistant. He has a good evil laugh. The only other important thing about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it presents many older people who perform their own stunts. Seriously, the majority of the cast has some serious blows for the elderly.
