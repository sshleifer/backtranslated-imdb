There is an interesting discussion in this movie. Is being a moral person good enough or do you need something else? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without God's guidance, being a morally good person is not enough. There is a line at the beginning of the film, "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but we both know he is going to hell." <br /> <br /> Although I am not a Christian, discussions about this throughout the course of the film were fascinating, but not the way the film intended. I left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good * is * enough. The arguments and arguments presented were strongly biased, so much so that they crushed the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be powerful, especially when inferred in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As the character of George Carlin in Dogma said: "hook them while they are young". <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very interesting too. A biblical scholar of the 1890s is trying to publish a book that says morality without God is fine, as long as morality is meaningful. Do you just tell a child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to do it? (not bothering to mention telling the child not to steal because, well, how would it feel if his marbles were stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants her school to recommend it. Help sell the book (to spread the word). However, you need a unanimous consent, and one of the academics is opposed. He mentions, in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about morality for the sake of morality against the argument of the words of God. To prove his point, he produces a time machine (put into the movie just to make the plot work, which is fine with me), and sends Carlisle back to 2002 to see where the teaching of morality without God will take us . <Br /> <br /> As should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has been reversed at the time of his return (because he comes back, that's not really a spoiler, this is a bible movie after all). <br /> <br /> As for the film as a movie in itself, it is quite slow and quite badly acted. Something I * did * not * need in this film, is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to find out who Carlisle is, even if he has not hurt anyone, committed a crime or anything. What's wrong with the movie that only shows Carlisle's opinion, shows his vision of this "sinful world" and gives him a new point of view? <br /> <br /> Also, there are some points in the movie that tell me I'm happy, I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says "It's God or nothing". Three near the end of the movie disconcerted me ... first, when the two "bad guys" corner Carlisle right before he jumps, Carlisle makes his * only * truly despicable act ... pretends that his leap of time is the come from Jesus, and he does it so that the "bad guys" (who are also Christians by the way, oddly enough), think that they simply missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Second, after Carlisle returns, he finds a child he scolded at the beginning of the film about not stealing (but without mentioning God, the boy kept the marbles and ran away), and tells him this It is time that stealing is bad because God commands it. Like Carlin's earlier quote, frightening children in religion is a misstep in my book. <br /> <br /> And, finally, the epilogue. Another scare tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far in the future they could go, and he says he does not know ... the epilogue shows him trying to deform a bible in the distant future (it starts at 2100), and it fails ... it keeps decreasing the years before 10, and trying again, and for gradual disappearance, it's like 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carlise mentions that she felt the end of the world approaching, because the world was full of sin and the loss of God's name ... the scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years .. You would think about this enlightened time, the church would also have been enlightened. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was pretty sure that it was enough to be morally good before, now I know for sure. It's worth seeing if you're not a Christian, to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the people in this movie.
