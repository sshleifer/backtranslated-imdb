I remember when this came out, a lot of kids were crazy about that. I guess I was too old to get excited and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and I always found it a bit corny. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the 90s, we were overwhelmed with programs like this one. to make the children feel that they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these children in 3 Ninjas. I think that eventually the parents and the filmmakers got tired of that because the only thing we had in reality was that the children were hitting and hitting everyone. <br /> <br /> Many movies for children have an important point they are trying to make. and it is good that your children see and receive the message, this has no message at all ... only explodes a million different things in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie has no great visual qualities, but would you expect it to do so? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a great actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here ... The old, small, fat, bulging eyes like a powerful ninja who was simply hilarious. The children acted too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie has an argument that everyone knows before reading the review. 3 ninjas ... yes, you know they're going to fight with a bunch of bad guys and win, obviously ... I need to say more. I'm sorry if I ruined it for someone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, CHILDREN WILL LOVE IT. This film is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you do not mind that your son watches movies about children fighting, this is a good movie for them to see. If you do not mind allowing your children to see the complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or the reality period, then you have found a movie for your children ... I say children because I think that Even the girls will do it. I like ... I remember all the girls who are in love with Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for children and still make it nice for adults ... this movie has failed a lot in that ... It's beyond corny and nothing original or only one, and I would not allow a child of mine to see it ... The Kung Fu television series is on DVD and there are many great films by Shaw Brothers. ... Why do not you show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb on the road, maybe even teach them some movements and not just how to kick a man between their legs like Grandpa did in 3 Ninjas ... no no? no ... never kick a man between the legs ... never ... that's so inconceivable.
