horrible, just horrible my old roommate used to see this garbage and it drove me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and it is a pity that some people never know how it really is because their first impressions are to dribble in this way. They changed so much that it's barely recognizable. what baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for today's entertainment. It's like one of those lifelong movies that say "based on a true story" but that are completely fictitious. There is nothing of the emotion or the depth of the book, only the melodrama without sense. If you are a high school student looking for a way out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
