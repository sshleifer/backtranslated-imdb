This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> Try to copy some borrowed effects to a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are pretty bad, some of the worst I've heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I've almost never found him very convincing), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is silly, the ending is ... Stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I do not dislike the movie from Christophe Gans's "Le pacte des loups" (Brotherhood of the Wolf) (and I see / see approximately 80-100 films per year.), but at least that movie I had some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here (only qualified), and when I saw the rating and comments, I thought I had to write something down. <br /> <br /> I suppose that we will not have problems to sell the DVD that they offered us: it is not such a bad movie in our (great) collection! <br /> <br /> I am open-minded (I see SF, westerns, drama, comedies, silences, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so boring that I felt I had lost an hour and half.
