"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It stars Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners." The director, Howard Morris, has appeared in several comedies of Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and has left a mark in animation (the characters he has voiced include Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is too serious for it to work effectively. Allen's original work was ironic, which is why it worked on Broadway and Allen's remake of 1994. The script by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock defeat the premise until death and make too many changes with respect to the original work. Making Gleason's wife a hollow head in this version when she was a stubborn woman in the original is just one example of why this does not work. <br /> <br /> The acting is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can not save this. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor, as he showed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality might have worked here, but bad writing does not even give him a chance. Too. The wife of Airhead by Estelle Parsons will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how soon it will take you to want to strangle her. That is also a shame because she is also a good actress, since she has performed two exceptional performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors does particularly well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with him and with Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) up front. They manage to hit all the right notes and the movie itself is a comic book masterpiece. Finally it is in video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find that version. Everything that is original from 1969 is good for cleaning unwanted guests who stayed longer than expected. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 stars
