I stopped for five minutes when Beowulf was given a double-shot automatic crossbow with sights in it. The crossbows not only do not have telescopic sights, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The terrible wooden performance and the eternal darkness that plague all the original science fiction films did not help either. Having entered only a few minutes before, I felt my bile rise and I decided to see the repetitions of I Love Lucy, that's all I have to say. But, you could also realize that it is a movie made for television and omit it right there. <br /> <br /> A farce.
