The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be funny. Everyone in this movie looks like an abandoned pornography industry. In fact, I've seen better acting in low budget porn. I thought I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: watch your butt Nick: you look at yours (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how the production is horrible, but it's really funny: the good ones have transforming weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it off, they make a weapon change between scenes with a pair of M-16s! I think they had a budget shortage for weapons, not enough to go between the good guys and the bad guys. The scenes of struggle are poorly coordinated and false as hell. You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade so that it explodes on its own. You can not fire a missile of any kind while driving inside a helicopter. The weapons that you throw do not suddenly appear again. When a weapon runs out of bullets, throwing it is pretty stupid. Unless you have no idea how to recharge them ... The big slow trucks that circulate in the first gear make uncomfortable action scenes. I really can not believe that movies like this are really produced. This movie would be hilarious about nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
