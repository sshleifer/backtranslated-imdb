It is difficult to find any positive aspect in this movie. It seems that the producer needed to make money without much effort and, therefore, we are invited to a complete demonstration of Galaxy, which is the most fervent excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More shots of action from the two policemen and much less from Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course, that would be added to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with that regrettable execution. Ms. Albright makes an excellent sexy appearance and her performance is first class. Mrs. Stabs, whom she had heard about but had not seen on the screen before, also seemed very desirable, but she seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Mrs. Albright, this is real trash.
