Vovochka is your daily movie of hooligan vs authority. Vovochka, the main character, is marked early as a bad influence on the children of the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom of a couple of adults he meets along the way, it is difficult for him to change his naughty ways, but at the same time worthy to do so. Personally, the actor who played Vovochka was too upset to sympathize with him, however, the change of tone of the film would allow most to feel the emotional struggle with which Vovochka faces when he wants to be good, but still things happen bad. This fight makes the film a bit different from other films of the same genre, that's the little taste I meant. In general, I did not mind this movie, although it was probably aimed at a younger audience.
