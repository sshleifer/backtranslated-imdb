Undeveloped / incredible story line, (by the time I realized where I was going, I did not care anymore) the bad casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a hit man ???) misdirection, (do you have you ever seen Tracey Ullman act SO bad?) (Was I supposed to worry about what happened to the inept incompetent and ethical of the character of John Ritter?) Wrong script ... (Actually, I'm not looking for a script of formulas, but this was really horrible.) The only really good thing in it was the boy. Ten lines? Is not it okay if your comment is less than ten lines? COme on-- Whose rules are these? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines? Is not that kind of arbitrary? Why is not it okay to have less than 10 comment lines?
