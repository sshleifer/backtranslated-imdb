This has to be one of the 5 worst movies that have been made. The plot seemed intriguing as that of Passenger 57. But with the latest movie, somehow, it worked much better. The plot has developed in the worst possible way. Just some of the frightening moments of the movie, is a flight attendant standing in the open door of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being kicked out by the winds of 250 miles per hour? After that the plane lands from a few kilometers from 8000 feet, that is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When he is on the track (perfectly straight, of course), he is ordered to pull the fins, HUH! Come on, the fins are there to ensure the lift at low speeds, when the thrust is used on the track and the maximum power is obtained! I can go on and on about small and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie that wants to get lost, take my word!
