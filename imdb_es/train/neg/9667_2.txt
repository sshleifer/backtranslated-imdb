This film is justly famous for being one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of Jews with illness is simply pathological, and what is worse, it almost becomes credible for brief seconds <br /> <br /> through its pure repetition. The fact that something so crude works, even <br /> <br /> briefly, is an objective lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this, and I would not recommend trying it unless you have a good reason.
