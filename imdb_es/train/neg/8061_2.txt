I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work a lot. I wish I was in more movies that showed their talent. With that said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I would have to say that I attribute almost all the blame to the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well and Eliza Dushku is currently the girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. I had the twists and turns you expected, but they simply did not lead anywhere ... except to more confusion. I just found the end very anti-climatic, because it seems that it does not make any sense or really does not answer any of the questions I had about the story. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie A good review, but I can not. Honestly, the only thing that I think will scare this movie is that he paid for it.
