If you liked "Blair with" you will like this one. It has the same bad job of camera and soundtrack, and has the same non-existent plot and moments of suspense. <br /> <br /> He also has Tom Savini, so if you like the "Dawn of the Dead" by Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez, "From Dusk Till Dawn" await you. He is an icon and also a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This film is definitely the most lousy I've seen in a long time, and I've seen quite a few movies, also bad. I can tell you that most horror movies seem entertaining, but this was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked girls and the hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have missed it before clicking "send" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if you have sexy girls with teeth on the cover
