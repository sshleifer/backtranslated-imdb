I was very disappointed with this movie. I expected more from a crime movie between friends Thelma and Louise. In contrast, the women who escape from prison in this film, had no sense of loyalty to each other. They were a group of extremely vulgar hyenas, who beat each other, crossed each other and even committed lesbian rapes against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being cunning thieves, who stayed together to plan their escape and find the hidden hiding place of money, the women who escaped were too selfish and vicious, to trust each other for a long time . These women were not released in a positive way. They just ended up being a bunch of loose cannons, unable to respect themselves, or others. If you like the movies of the 70s in crime, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
