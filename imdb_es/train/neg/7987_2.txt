I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's nonsense. The message of the film is clich√©. The vision of the circle is disorienting. And that horrible song in the end is grating. And I would really like them to install seats. After so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a movie to watch, it sounds pretty glamorous! You entertain yourself sitting, right? INCORRECT! You are standing there for more than 18 minutes leaning against a small railing. Disney should make a new attraction for Maelstrom to animate things and replace this dull and dull film. IT IS NOT FUNNY. Skip it. In fact, avoid Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom.
