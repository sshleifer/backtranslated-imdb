I have nothing against a movement of accelerated fear, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too recent, too bright and modern. The conspiracy, about a new teenager in a small town that is a "sleepwalker", a kind of cross between a vampire and a werewolf, and that feeds on the blood of virgins, begs for a more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. . This thriller is given an improperly colorful look and feel, almost without atmosphere. Children are predictably pretty and energetic, but the big advantage is that Alice Kridge is the child's mother; Kridge, from "Ghost Story", never parted from the female filling mold, and it's a great loss that they have not used it anymore. His performance is eerie and intense, and hints that "Sleepwalkers" could have been a much better movie with a different approach and a more closed direction. It is too exaggerated and commercially driven, with an uneven tone that oscillates violently from suspense to comedy and drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, as do real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
