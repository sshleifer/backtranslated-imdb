This was just a terrible movie. It hurts to see it. Almost all the actions were demotivated within the context of the film, the acting was really bad (P.Diddy was the best actor that really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links with Carlito's Way were fine, for example, their dream of one day moving to Carribien, but in general they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was totally wrong, but that is debatable. Anyway, I really did not expect much before watching the movie and I guess you could say that those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's actually a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). Although he's lucky because I'm sure there will not be many people watching this movie. In general, I give the movies a decent rating if they wake me up, so I'm going to go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time. And yes, I enjoyed Carlito's way.
