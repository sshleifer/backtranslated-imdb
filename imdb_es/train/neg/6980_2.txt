Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you squint, and light falls on the subject. But the precision of the core is not a compensation for a shadowy, irregular and inconsistent plot, lots of cardboard dialogues and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are merely characterizations; Shameful stereotypes ranging from the 'enigmatic and noble' American Indians to the 'suffocated but sadistic' British officers. A miserable and unworthy version of a fascinating period in the history of the United States. I want my money back.
