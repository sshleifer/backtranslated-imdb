If there is a hell, it contains a projection room in which GRAND CANYON is playing again and again in an eternal loop. One would expect the presence of so many wonderful actors (Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker) to help offset the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity). . But no. Apparently, they injected these other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The whole thing is pretentious, exaggerated, insulting (if you're deaf or you know someone who is deaf, get ready for your blood to boil in the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of hateful and self-involved people, but it never gives us a reason to want / understand / sympathize with them or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers with whom the set of genes would be better without it. There is no plot to talk about, no character development (these people will never develop), there is no breaking performance and the greatest arc writing you will ever find in a movie. The best of GRAND CANYON? Your title This is a big hole in a movie.
