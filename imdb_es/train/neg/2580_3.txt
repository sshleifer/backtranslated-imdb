Well, it's official. They just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this and the others have been terrible. I mean that the story is about two university fraternities that fight with each other for their houses, I mean to speak of a weak plan, the first three are related to growth, change and marriage, all of which are worthy points. development in human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to try to compare yourself to the Steven Stifler but there are no cigars. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 fun parts in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie, of course, is Jim's father, I do not know why he keeps doing these things badly. Films developed.
