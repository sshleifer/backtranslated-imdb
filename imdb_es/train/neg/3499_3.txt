Comedy Central has been successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the very popular Colbert Report are professional comic stars and they all are, or, in the case of Chapelle Show, they were solid shows. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I expected good things when I tuned in. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some mild Fun sequences, but since the star is Silverman's caliber, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and I hope the show next week is better. If not, get help in the form of better writers for the program.
