My favorite memory of this program and the band was when I met with a group of friends who hate NBB and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of photos of the members of The band threw them into the fire and danced a happy template around the burning things as they sang "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead." That was the best thing about the program and this program is stupid with a capitol. God, this program sucks. I hate it so much Get rid of the fucking car. You really suck! You really ruined the entire channel! No offense or anything, but you need to get a life, I mean, really, who does a stupid show with a stupid singer who can not even sing! You really sound horrible and you need to get a life like hobos or something, except Roselina. She is really cute. But still, guys, goats!
