Zu Warriors should definitely have been an animated series because like a movie it's like watching an old anime in acid. The movie starts out of nowhere and people simply fly fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her. your lover in a cloud or something. Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me, but soon this flying wind, a bad guy, kills her while the man with the shaving wings fights with another mystical thing of God / Demon / Wizard. The plot line is not there or is extremely difficult to follow, you need to be incredibly smart to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal whom this god calls to fight against the evil flight, the princess who kills the bad guy and soon we have a badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a scene of fighting with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something like that . Even the images are strange, some might say they are impressive and colorful, but I will say they are fuzzy and an acid trip like (yes, that's a word!). I saw it folded and with subtitles, and both were equally bad and hard to understand ... Who am I cheating? I did not understand it at all. I was watching episode 30 of a 1980 anime and I completely missed how the story started or how I started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because I had no idea how this thing started, where it was going or how it would end, I lost all the time. I can honestly say that this was one of the worst cinematic experiences of all, it was like watching Inu-Yasha in episode 134 drunk ... yes, you do not know what the hell is going on. Do not waste your brain trying to solve this
