"Ambush" is not an ordinary action movie. It is very bad to be ordinary. A man walks towards the other with a live machine gun. The other man fires an assault and knocks the man down with the greatest firepower without a single blow from the shower of lead that falls on him. Guess what the good boy is. Duh Tal is "ambushed" through and through. It's not a good action movie, it's not a good drama, it's not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails on all levels with its cast of veterans from film B who mechanically review the movements almost as if they knew they were making a true loser. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
