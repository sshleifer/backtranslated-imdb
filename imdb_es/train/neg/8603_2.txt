This could have been a very entertaining movie, but instead, it is placed next to other misdeeds such as Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the film food chain. If they had played this ironic movie, it could have been a very entertaining film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it frankly in some places, but more often directly. <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is a small community besieged by mutated slugs. There is a toxic waste dump abandoned near a sewer line that turns slugs into aggressive monsters that eat meat, although they are slowly moving monsters and can be crushed under your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people who seem willing to fight the slugs, while the sheriff and the mayor believe they are crazy. The climax is an uproar of laughter, not intentional, which makes you scratch your head about the stupid (the actors and the screenwriter) on the stage to destroy the slugs. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (No new foundations Simon seems to interpret gore elements with his tongue on his cheek, but the dialogue is straightforward.If Simon had worked with an intelligent script (one with a lot of simple phrases and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult movie.) VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed here.) We have many explosive scenes of thoracic cavities, as well as a big bang In the midst of an excellent Italian restaurant, the blood and entrails, which many horror moviegoers enjoy, are in full swing here.They also get corpses from people who have been cleaned by slugs and many scenes of slug destruction ). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Wow!) Michael It seems that Garfield knows that this script sucks and that he presents his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how ridiculous this movie is. Terry, As his wife, he does an adequate job even though she does little more than scream to keep her face while screaming. The "teenagers" were all horrible actors, with no exceptions. Man, this movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers get naughty in bed before being sent, in a bad scene, by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's room, both male and female nudes here).
