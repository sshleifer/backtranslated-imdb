What more can I say? The performance was, almost without exception, amateur. The direction and continuity were regrettable. The scene was predictable until the last scene and the tedious dialogue. One of the features on the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel," but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was in the director's comments about the DVD. He said, with a serious face, that he had set out to make a film with high production values ​​and a cast of names, and that he had succeeded. With delusions like that, it's easy to understand how the movie turned out like it did. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The dark werewolf costume was a modified monkey outfit (according to the 'making of' feature on the DVD) and rather looked at it. The mask and claws were little better than the shelf work of any costume store. CGI effects were painfully obvious and of similar quality to an economic video game.
