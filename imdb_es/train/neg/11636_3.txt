I will not waste my time writing an essay and I will waste your time. I would like to say, however, that everyone who is concerned about this film, even if it is being made, is totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play that card, and I mean the patriotic card of nationalism, so that people do not see this movie. This is a film that expresses his free will in this country (oh yes, I played that letter) even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he looks for a camera, but the world is full of controversy, and It's the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laugh and feel disgusted, not upset all together, it's black humor and obviously you have no heart to bear it, the past is past, yes, people remember those who got lost, but it's time to move on, that was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides I'm crazy, and who needs a soul?
