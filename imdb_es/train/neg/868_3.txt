Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed the monkeys. The monkeys are fun. People with amnesia who do not say much, just sit there with empty eyes are not so funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is no black person in it, and there is nothing funny either. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things in some way and puts them on their shelf of dollars. It is labeled as Unrated. I think they took the scene topless. It is possible that they have taken other things as well, who knows? All we know is that whatever it is that has been removed, it no longer exists. <br /> <br /> The performance seemed good to me. There are many unfathomable things. Is it supposed to be a city? Is it supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church, people are fanning themselves, why do they all wear coats?
