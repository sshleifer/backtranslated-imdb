I did not like this movie. I thought the acting was not very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer saving the day? I thought this was a bit of an exaggeration, even for a movie. I could not understand why they could not just turn it off, why not use a hammer. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original movie of the 80 you expected much more than what was really delivered. This movie could have been a 21st century version of the old movie, it was not. If that's what you want to see, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer had not appeared to save the day, this would be, in my opinion, a very cheesy movie ...
