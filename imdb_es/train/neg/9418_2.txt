This is a weak movie with a problematic story of cuts and name changes. It does not work at all. First, the dramaturgy is all wrong. It is very slow at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily comes to an end. But there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uncomfortable movement between the genres. It begins with being a thriller that must be taken at first sight and then degenerates into a farce instead of satire. The ending can be fun, but it is also so direct that I almost felt that it insulted my intelligence (how little there is). So the movie tries to be everything, but in reality it does not succeed at any level. You can also see it in the development of the very unstable character. You almost get the impression that Connery plays three roles instead of one.
