1st seen 4/29/2007 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King's movie, as Campy's vampire, has so many strange and foolish elements that you start laughing because of the extreme rarity of 3/4 in the I walk towards the movie and you wonder if this movie could have a cult for King fans. It is the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers (a race of humanoids similar to felines that change shape, eat meat, need life and are almost extinct) that move from one city to another in search of virgins to feed and stay alive. They look like pretty normal upper-class people, except they are secret lovers and cats walk around their house, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they put traps in their yard to try to keep the population low. We get to see them break a couple of necks when they attack (which is also the first time in my experience of going to the movies), hopefully, no real cat was harmed in the making of the movie. The boy looks for a sweet girl with whom he is in love until he becomes a "sleepwalker" and then only wants his body. There is so much countryside uniqueness in this movie that it could have been better if it were a satirical comedy without limits in the life of the suburbs, but the director tries to scare you every couple of minutes until you want to have overcome it. take out the gore Eventually, that happens and the movie boils down to its typical downbeat ending by Stephen King. The film is interesting because King's humor appears more than usual, but its rarity is also very present and what you have is a movie that your fans will probably like and should have in your collection, but as a valuable cinematic experience, It really is not like that. cut it
