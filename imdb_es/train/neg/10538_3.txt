The First Power (1990) was a terrible movie that premiered in the late 80's and early 90's horror films made at low cost. I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts. This film lacks so much sense and credibility that it's not even funny. The speedy justice system in this movie makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is in his head with this role (he plays a tough cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most attractive sister) plays a psychic. Do not waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I take it back. This movie makes a great party movie. Take a look at the crucifix packing nun, she has the nicest legs I've seen in a nun who was not in a non-exploitation movie of Jesus Franco. Already! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he could not attract flies to a pile of dung. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
