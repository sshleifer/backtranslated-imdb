POPEYE AND FOOT BIG **; THE POPEYE ENGINE COMPANY **; HOW TO GET THE POPEYE GOAT ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used to give this as a child, but when I watched an episode of the series that included three cartoons in a row now, that is, several years later ( they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate thread RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they do not resist so well! To begin with, the character of Popeye is not exactly nice, Olive Oyl clearly dominant and Bluto's antics were not able to arouse much interest. In short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, quite awful and, generally, not very comfortable to boot. They are strictly juvenile rates, however, I doubt that today's children have the patience to stay with them; In addition, the style of animation is not attractive. <br /> <br /> Taking each short per se, I guess they improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as such, so that the third caricature easily results in being the most pleasant of the lot? Popeye is entrusted with a goat from the army of pets, whose immense appetite does not cause him many antics (almost nothing original, I know, but it is always a fun tactic). An interesting element here was that the shorts were accompanied with Popeye delivering fragments of moralistic wisdom to the children in the audience.
