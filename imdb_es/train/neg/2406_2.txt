From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another cinematic mud. Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity it has with anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (even if it's an Africa that has dinosaurs, which our intrepid adventurers use to get their canoes out!) , And it has some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to find a treasure, armed only with a medallion, and ended up exactly where the treasure is, just by chance. On the way, they encounter a varied assortment of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's hilarious. That's the only reason why I did not give him a 1.
