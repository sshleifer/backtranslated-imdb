I bought this movie for 1 euro, without knowing what it was. I thought "hmmm, a movie called a man of mutilation should be, if not very funny, at least full of blood". It was not funny, it's good. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not care about disturbing movies, but this does not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing. hmmm ... The quality of the images was terrible. The acting ... there was no acting. Only a little fcker has been mutilated for more than 90 minutes. Probably, this is material for the illnesses of the patient in extreme gore. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. It's not worth your time. It is simply horrible. I wish I had never bought this. <br /> <br /> They should mutilate the guy who did this.
