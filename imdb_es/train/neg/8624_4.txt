The performance was not great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. It is about the repercussions of the struggle between the right-wing voters of the Flemish bloc on the one hand and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp, on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of history on the Belgian side of the West or of the modern Romeo and Juliet? The movie is simply not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming those were also the director's questions). However, some of the scenes could work as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the far-right party Flemish Block and is struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this does not succeed, unfortunately. However, he is telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign spectators who observe him should try to enjoy it and realize that it is not the film that matters, but the social dividing lines that haunt it in Belgium, a country of 10 million people, in the 2000s. > <br /> Dries Van Dongen
