Horrible acting, bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes later, I decided to move quickly to see if something would happen that would redeem ... It was not like that. (Apart from a good chest blow) The movie was apparently filmed in some furniture store, and the same store was used for at least 90% of the sets. You can even see this same red chair in different "locations". If you are going to make a movie, at least rent an office building and an apartment, not a store that echoes all the dialogues of your actors. (Note to producers) Rental of a small office space and an apartment for a month are much cheaper than a full warehouse, and both are a bit more versatile and credible. If you spend your money renting these people, I hope you got it with a money back guarantee ... You will demand that I get your money back ... I just spent $ 2.99 to rent this tonight and I feel cheated.
