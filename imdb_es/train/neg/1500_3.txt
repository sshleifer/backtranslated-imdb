Oh, this is so bad, it's funny. The only way you could explain something like this is at a porn drug party that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean: you can see topless porn actresses, have sex and then be killed by human mutants. There's a lot of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, she's half the person she used to be" and the accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find fun things like the intestines that go through someone's ass and a guy who runs through the forest and then is beheaded by a cable tied between two trees (which sounds a metallic sound, as in cartoons). Somehow, there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what is inside an actress, the simple genitals are not enough. Therefore, you can see a lot of summary autopsies on dead bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco would want when he accepted a role here. I think this is a film that has to do with the fast forward button and just see the juicy things, just to remember the horror movies of the old school C class.
