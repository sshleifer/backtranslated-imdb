The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that just by looking for this movie and investing time to watch it, you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its directors, particularly director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> The already volatile Peckinpah was heading towards bad weather with this movie. According to at least one biographer, this is where he became familiar with cocaine. Add to that your excessive alcohol consumption, and it's no wonder that things fall apart. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is good and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, they live well and they seem to be the best friends, then something happens that destroys their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows them exploding a building: why do not they tell us exactly, even. For the course regarding the dark motivation of this movie. But the implication is that these guys hurt people and do not care, since anti-heroes look a lot like Peckinpah's Wild Bunch not so long ago. An opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, and then adds with obvious anger "", of course, the idea that the CIA could employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, absurd. That's a very smart way to let the audience know that all bets are canceled. <br /> <br /> Add to that a traditionally strong backup cast of Peckinpah, which includes Burt Young, Gig Young and regular Peckinpah Bo Hopkins in the primal role of a madman who can not pass up the opportunity to receive a shot of $ 500 per day, and only want the writers, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, try to do something else with the story that make it a platform for the lazy-liner and bad imitations of chop socky. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary is uncomfortable. "You're so busy doing your dirty work, you can not tell who the bad guys are," someone tells Locken, as if he or we needed him pointed out. <br /> <br /> Worse still are the clumsy directions of Peckinpah and the slow pace. We are 40 minutes away from the movie before we have our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots in which a group of people we have not even met before were fighting at the San Francisco airport, their battle It is interspersed with a conversation in an office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, what remains of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of Victory Ships, with the ninjas running out into the open to be shot down while Caan is thrown. A lining that undermines any hint of real suspense. "Leave me seven to five, I'll take the little one," he whispered just before a climactic samurai duel between two ninja warriors from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but, surprisingly, no Mounties arrive to break things up). <br /> <br /> Caan is much better at smaller scenes, like when Locken, who is recovering from some unpleasant wounds, is counted by one person. of their bosses, played by a gentle Arthur Hill, who has been "abandoned by the organization". Caan refuses to remain depressed, and his scenes of recovery, although they kill the momentum of the film, show a good performance of him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as a support nurse. Caan was one of the best actors of the 1970s, and his laconic play with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins and the two Youngs gives "Killer Elite" a real surveillance ability. <br /> <br /> But you do not see "Killer Elite" thinking about that You see it thinking about the movie that got away.
