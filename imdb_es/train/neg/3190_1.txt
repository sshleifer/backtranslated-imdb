Jimmy Dean could not have been more ridiculous or absurdly ridiculous. Hysterical if seen through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rate with a 10. I mean, the sight of this obese pig and fed corn in Malta should be enough to send you to vomit, if you do. far in the movie. This ugly and hysterical farce must be placed under the names of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". A "drink" like this shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. they fall behind on their mortgage or are stoned to the point of madness. The question arises, "Who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then, if good judgment prevailed and "Final Justice" never was, then we would not have the lovely parody in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
