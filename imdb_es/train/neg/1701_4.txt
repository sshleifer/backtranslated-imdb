The gross and rude intake of David Lynch in South Park presents a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about middle-class suburban families. The father is a horrible monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular hole from which the most horrendous guttural noises are emitted, the son and the mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A series of equally absurd characters are presented throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie, In the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedies in general. . However, there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever fragments of animated cinematography, where Lynch transmits a wide range of reactions to his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots instead of facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I think Lynch was really trying to give his audience a direct, if disturbing, animated comedy here. Interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low humor (that is, most of Will Farrell's films) while adding elements of vicious social criticism and classic violence of cartoons and crude humor. While the mix really does not work very well here, it's nothing if it's not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching for the Lynch fans.
