I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway. God knows how many times and I felt that the passion, the desperation and the joy come from this experience live in the theater. Michael Bennett knew that he would have to reimagine "Chorus" for the screen, but he could never imagine how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is perplexed, he should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live, with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough, recently arrived from the musical work of "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle", ended up directing this film that looked little like the theater show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were deleted or delivered to other characters (which did not make sense). Michael Douglas was diverted. The people who could not dance tried to act and there was the sexy woman "Landers" who could not sing, act or dance. I guess she had just been Ghandi's wife. The dances of Jeffrey Hornaday are no more than a blockade of "Flashdance" rejected and nothing works. I stood there flabbergasted at the way something so fascinating and emotional could be drained to nothing. If you really love this show and return to Broadway in 2006, look at it but do not think that the long-running musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this movie.
