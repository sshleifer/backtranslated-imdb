I thought that at least it would be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fall asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is a song at the end that is just a guy yelling "Yaowwww!" While someone is randomly touching a wooden object. That said, there are some nice songs, but it's not worth watching your movie. Go to itunes (they have the album), preview it and choose the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. But you will see what I want to say if you see it. That said: YOU DO NOT GO!
