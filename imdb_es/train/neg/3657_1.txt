Whoever did this nonsense, completely lost the point. Jane is a silly comic strip to animate without being sordid. <br /> <br /> This giant mess is trying to be fun and exciting, but it's just a mess. There's no decent performance on him ... even the generally reliable Jasper Carrott is terribly unattractive. <br /> <br /> The American guy whose name escapes me is as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon. <br /> <br /> Maud Adams tries it like a villain, but she's a bit long on the tooth for this kind of thing.

Kirsten Holmes vanished in the dark after this and much better. <br /> <br /> I've thrown more entertaining things than this down the toilet. Avoid
