This was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the movie I got irritated and turned off the movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here is what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 They were filming in the father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 the dinosaurs (mostly) seemed to be fake <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist well he was upset <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the image on the DVD was really bad < br /> <br /> What I DO: <br /> <br /> 1 The music of Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have the soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it's fine for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs that inspire a kind of amazement. <br /> <br /> 3 The baby is a little cute when he is in the water and is playing <br /> <br /> 4 That funny scene with the carp. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who watch this movie hopefully learn that evil always loses.
