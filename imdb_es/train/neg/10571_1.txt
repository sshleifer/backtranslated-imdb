My wife is a fan of this show. That being the case, I bought their seasons from one to three and the fourth season is in order. Personally I think the show is a big farce that the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have limited herself to the other garbage movies she did, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few, and the other cast members they support are equally inept in their performances. I've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures series that I saw as a child. I can understand why male drivers stayed in the program for such short periods of time, although I do not know if it was their choice or not. Please. Please do not renew for another season, since that's enough, Bob.
