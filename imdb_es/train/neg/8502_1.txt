At first, it seems like an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in an interesting Madrid today, but it's nothing like that, it's really just an interesting movie for future film directors who learn about what not to do to make a film, can not. In other words, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent to watch this movie, the acting is horrible and it seems that the actors were just waiting to finish the diary. The shots to go home, do not lead anywhere and are boring, weak and bad, do not spend time or money in this movie.
