This installment of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn one or two things about the pace and the decent and plausible dialogue. There were times when I literally shouted to the television that something would happen. Maybe he thinks he's creating suspense, but Carpenter needs to cut out that exaggerated and simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and move forward a bit in the action. How many times did the girl say: "Oh no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, no here comes"? Carpenter takes much, much better movie elements (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and launches them here as if we are supposed to recognize and appreciate his signature style. What is missing here is genuine suspense and energy. It's like I'm sleeping through the process of making movies. <br /> <br /> To get better Carpenter movies, stick to tried and true classics: The Thing, Halloween, and They Live. For the best masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the House of Witches.
