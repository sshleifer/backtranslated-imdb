It gets really bad. The only redemption quality halfway through are the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, except for Kirk. The story is as complete as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself simply kills the movie, if it was no longer a corpse. So, in general, it's a waste of your life. I would have given a zero if it had been an option on the rating scale.
