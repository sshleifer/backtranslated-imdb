Frank Tashlin's 'The Home Front' is one of the most lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Instead of Snafu taking some inadvisable actions that lead to disaster, 'The Home Front' focuses on their loved ones at home and how much they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. It is a concept with few possibilities of good gags and, on the other hand, Tashlin plays with more strength the card of laughter, extended jokes in which strippers and dancers participate with little clothes instead of a very effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning short that has little relevance or entertainment value today, other than as a historical artifact.
