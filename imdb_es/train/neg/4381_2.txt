Cut to chase, this is one of the five worst movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's not that they have not tried. There were some decent writings with some structure elements there, a good cast, some good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may have been a bad structure and not an important story, much exaggeration on the part of the leader (which is probably much better when restricted), some misdirection and editing. I had enough in about an hour, tearing my hair in about an hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it lasted. There was also a lack of sincerity about it, since I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. I was agitated because it gave glamor to something that did not have anything good. That was reinforced by the beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old drug addict. <br /> <br /> And the frantic nature of the advantage was a sufficient detour. There were disordered plot points that attempted a structure, but the end result was indifferent and interminable (with unequal timelines). The characters were colorful but they had no end, which made me feel bad for quality actors that you have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Skip. I assumed that this was a director for the first time who was in love with his own fans, but he had done it before. I'm confused about how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will really give them money.
