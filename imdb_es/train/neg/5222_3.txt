This is really a very bad movie. Why? First, the story is bad. It's an artificial story, combining all kinds of things that do not make sense. It just seems like a wrong experiment. Second, the actors can not play in a realistic way. They can not even talk like an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with that now?
