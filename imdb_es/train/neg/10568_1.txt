Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this really takes away the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the last decade, without exaggerating. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the war in Afghanistan of the US Army. UU., It seemed almost impossible to finish seeing this ridiculous movie, not because it brought me memories, far from that, but because there was no attempt at "authenticity" anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the little bit. It looked like it had been written by an 8-year-old boy who got all his notions of war (and soldier behavior) straight from the comics. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can not fully explain the atrocious production values ​​of this cliché garbage. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical failures, but it would take virtually forever. From the old shoulder patches of the unit that have not been seen or used since World War II, and the labels with the names of the characters, such as "ColCollins" (which carries the character "Colonel Collins"), in fact they were spelled with the inverted image in the mirror "N" of the Russian alphabet (not the American alphabet) the list goes on and on. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot and, very especially, the behavior of the characters themselves: each scene was full of ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and totally unreflective clichés. <br /> <br /> Neither the story itself nor the characters were in the least credible or credible. Everything was ridiculously childish, in the extreme. Obviously, this was a film that was intended to attract strictly prepubescent children, and I have little doubt that even they would find this movie absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film has absolutely no redeeming quality. absolutely. It is a total waste of time. I strongly recommend to anyone who reads this to pass this garbage; It is not worth losing a single moment of your time.
