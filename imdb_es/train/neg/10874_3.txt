I just finished a marathon of this series, and it became an agony to see it as it progressed. From the fiction of the historical elements, to the terrible accent of O'Herlihy in later episodes, the spectacle collapses as it advances. If you are looking for some generalized low-quality production WW2 fluff, then you might recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, degenerating one step away from a telenovela, with increasingly worse story lines and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The old black and white film is by far the best form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one might expect.
