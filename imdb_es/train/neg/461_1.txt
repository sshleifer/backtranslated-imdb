Warning: Avoid this super duper movie and horrible ... if you saw it you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandma's age now, what are they doing? Trying to be so innocent and sexy young, just do not work at all. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script is absolutely atrocious, I can not believe that someone can get such unpleasant ideas. With the development of the film industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the last century. I bet the spectators of the last century will also hate this. <br /> <br /> Get away from that. I think watching 2004's "White Chicks" is much better than this ... do not make mistakes, I thought that's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
