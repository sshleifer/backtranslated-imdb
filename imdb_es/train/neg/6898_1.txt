Avoid this shit at all costs. Bad script, bad direction, bad performance, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be of western flavor, it is not. Try to be violent, it is not. Try to present a new look at an old genre, it does not. The actors try better, and my heart is with them. But with such inane material to work, it is difficult to make something shine. For me, this has all the appearances of a "new film school that is going to set the world on fire" on the first try. Freshman filmmakers often bite more than they, or their budget, can chew. The best they can do is go back a few steps, re-evaluate what is possible and work within their limited budget the next time they leave.
