If there's one thing you can tell Disney about, it's your weird ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even seeing the commercial of Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney is going to ruin one of its most incredible classics. I even had that spaghetti meatball scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this unfortunate live video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a replay of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad films. The pair of penguins and walruses (I have even forgotten their names) are just a poor quality copy of Timon and Pumba. Morgana is another Ursula. It even repeats practically all its old lines. The songs are pathetic, very abysmal. I've never heard such bad songs from them before now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It is pathetic and simplistic. On the positive side, at least they took the time to make the animation decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe that's inconvenient for Little Mermaid fans). Back to the negative, Melody is so disgustingly cute that you could throw up. I almost did. Do yourself a favor and your Little Mermaid fan. Do not waste your money on this. It is true that it is not as horrible as the Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that is not a great consolation.
