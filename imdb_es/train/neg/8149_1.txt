What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I met "Pretty ugly ...", I was delighted to discover that this drama had been commissioned. <br /> <br /> Obviously I had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing about this program, and even he does not fit well. How someone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of scum surpasses me. <br /> <br /> The whole characters are changed, the situations are eliminated and, to see the dramatic theft of Parlablane reduced to Nesbitt doing a Quick I raised my chin and opened a window ... it made me cry. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen to "Country Of The Blind" if this is the point of reference ... <br /> <br /> Please, just avoid it ...
