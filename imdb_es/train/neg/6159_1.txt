Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us if they are fencers or not? That point is completely irrelevant to any argument made against this total dog from a movie. <br /> <br /> I think that sports films are divided into two categories; Well done movies about the human spirit and competitions, and 'By the Sword'. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie could never decide what it wanted to be, a poignant drama to try to be the best in life, an Accusation of competitive motivation or a martial arts movie. In the end, I did none of those convincing or complete enough to make me take care of anything. <br /> <br /> For the record, I am also a fencing instructor (and now I am officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fences in a movie does not do it bad automatically. I mean watch Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fences). I liked those movies. But when the sport gets bad in a bad movie for some reason, people think that it is the purists who think that it is a scarce effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comments on the smaller subject of fencing. This is just a bad movie. In the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or just for anyone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie and I'm forced to think, `Man, I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks. I know it's time to avoid discussing with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is someone in the lobby who somehow returns me two hours of my life.
