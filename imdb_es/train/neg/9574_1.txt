This has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies I've seen in my entire life. Just when I think I've seen the most stupid scene in history, an even more stupid and weirder scene appears. I think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or better yet, their speaking tongue ... or maybe the guy who has the statue of the virgin mother mounted on a jeep windshield stuck in her throat. Decisions decisions...
