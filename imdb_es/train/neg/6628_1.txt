If the scale were negative, it would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and the director ruined the enjoyment of this story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting and everything distracted from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and the dances did not make you take your ears off your head, first. The film could have been done twice at 1.25 hours, and have been quite good, something like "Seven Samurai", but the director and the writer did not take that direction, even if the "villagers" finally find their backbone and they want to help. This film fails on many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script. Name any aspect of this movie. It was BAD, probably the provider's food was also bad. Never in 6 years of watching films from India (Bollywood) have I seen anything so badly done.
