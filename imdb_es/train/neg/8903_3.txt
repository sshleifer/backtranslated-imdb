Prophecy II, what is there to say about it? They have completely abandoned the originality of the first film, and they simply made a film sprinkled with Chris Walken. It is not even written by the original writer! <br /> <br /> If you've seen Nr. I do not look at nr. 2 is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the Nr. I do not look nr. two! Go to see nr. 1 to experience something original and fun.
