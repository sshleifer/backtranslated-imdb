Normally I would not feel qualified to review something that I only saw half an hour, but I will make an exception for this. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the bad guy's phrases: "I smell ... teacher!" "Sorry, teacher! You get an 'F!'" <br /> <br /> Bad boy and bad girl (right after killing 2 cops and stealing a truck full of drugs, they're getting very hot) : <br /> <br /> He - "So, how do you feel about shooting some innocent people?" <br /> <br /> Her- (purrs) "Surely you know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic child who ran for his life instead of helping someone, can summarize his life and his personality in this line: "I AM CHICKEN-TWIT! (This was the version of the US network.) My father was right! I'm not surprised he left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Actually it's not a spoiler) The bad boy (in flames) screams "Aargh! Fire!"
