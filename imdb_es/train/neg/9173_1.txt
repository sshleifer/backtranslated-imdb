I have never seen a movie worse. <br /> <br /> It is possible to take a shooting video game and turn it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: Absolutely no connection with any of the characters. In this movie you do not connect with any of the characters because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as interpreted. by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the result of the film is meaningless, since all the characters were left without life from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: the worst shooting scene ever seen. I love the shootings. I love when the heroes open up about the bad guys and clean the house. Hell I even like to see a clean house badguy sometimes. But this shooting was strange, I guess the best way to describe it is "Apathetic". I have seen people shooting with more emotion and feeling as they PLAY THE VIDEO GAME. In this film it looked and felt as if the "Actors" were simply walking and filming everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where is the trash talking? Where are the grunts of rage among the shots? These are supposed to be children who were trapped in a rave that went wrong ... but even the real soldiers act professionally and mercilessly show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD horror movie about an isolated house full of Monsters, I recommend the Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope the master and all the copies of this movie burn.
