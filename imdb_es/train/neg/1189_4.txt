The "bubbly" sound effect of the series used to put me to sleep. A very relaxing show. I think I could have slept in the parts where there was danger or danger. He had also heard that some installation shots for a show about spongeboarders went off in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I guess Lloyd Bridges never dived there. I only remember the show in repetitions and, although it was never exciting on the edge of the seat, we invented our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... imagining the bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads. . I thought 'Flipper' had better underwater action. Of course, it had the advantage of being in its natural environment.
