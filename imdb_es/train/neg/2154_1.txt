Let me confess. I found this used video and I bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on his jacket. But inside there was another story. Besides the fact that the film was basically a parody of the special effects of the genre "invisible man" (highly visible strings and other similar paraphernalia), the script did not waste any opportunity, in fact, did everything possible to insult everyone. -WASP races and real or imaginary homosexuals. Each insult directed at a person in the script was homophobic or racist or both. It begins to grind your nerves, along with the trembling sound, the photography in the style of a candid camera and the melodramatic story. However, the ending is somewhat surprising. But by the time you arrive, you do not care much. Too bad, it could have been a pretty good movie.
