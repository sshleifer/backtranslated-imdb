When the people of Kino Video gathered their excellent collection "Slapstick Encyclopedia", a selection of silent comedies of several cassettes, someone decided to start the first delivery with ONE TOO MANY (1916), a farce of a single reel made in Florida. The very young Oliver Hardy. Despite how nice the whole is, this decision was unfortunate, since ONE TOO MANY is a very bad movie that almost discourages the spectator to keep watching. Like any typical farce, it involves deception inspired by greed, panic when the plans go wrong, and complications that increase to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, ONE TOO is incoherent, not funny, and downright annoying. It is difficult to say at this point whether the confusing plot without remedy is the result of the lack of images or the ineptness of making a film, but whatever the cause, half way there, even the most alert viewer has no idea what are the relationships of the characters or what is happening. , and in the end one no longer worries. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest here is to see "Babe" Hardy, 24, who looks much heavier than he would a decade later when he joined Stan Laurel, but without However, it is full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, waking up with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic backward somersault from the bed. Trust me, that's as fun as this movie gets. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of the "Encyclopedia Slapstick" of Kino, I suggest you go quickly through this and jump to the good.
