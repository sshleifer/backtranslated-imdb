I rented End Game, I had never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I'd give it a try. After investigating a bit about the film, I discovered that it was initially intended for a theatrical premiere, but that it went to DVD instead. After seeing it, I'm thinking, "no wonder". The film is striking in its originality. The plot and the characters are superficial. I realized who was half the way, but the end was a curved ball. I must say that I did not expect it to end as it did, but that is not a point in its favor. The most predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad. Maybe the filmmakers saw how predictable the movie was and decided to give it a spin, even one that made the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
