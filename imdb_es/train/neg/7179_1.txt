No matter how well intentioned your "message" is, this movie is a tremendously elaborate madness - a horrible performance, a malfunction of the camera - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to start a stutter - it's lousy. You see the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follows him, he absorbs it, he loves being the center of attention. He's a bad actor, he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker: Eric Schaffer. Somehow, Carr has seen this movie in the city's Youth Centers and New Age churches, where injured people seeking reinforcement and attention babble about how the movie touched them and maybe they did, but as a movie in itself is choppy, predictable and full of sap.
