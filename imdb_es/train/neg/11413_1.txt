Seriously, avoid this movie at all costs. I just saw it on my first "advance" and, although I paid non-refundable money, I left the cinema after only 15 minutes. What already includes 2 minutes of discussion between my friends if they leave or not. The first time I came out of a movie. And I lived some pretty bad ones. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that doubles (and badly) even though it's shown in its original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. In the army ("What do we do once we get to the combat zone?" - "Get out of the car and you die" - actually, it's much more fun to read here than the way it was presented in the movie), about drugs (a man eats some "space cookies", behaves very foolishly and loses his wedding or has to live in it while he is high, all badly written and acted), about women in the army ("Why we just got trumpets? They promised us weapons! "-" That's how it is, it's how it will stay ") ... Argh. Well, you may really find this really funny, but in that case you scare me seriously. <br /> <br /> Also, I've seen better acting in the kind of soft porn movies you get on European television late at night. So he had bad jokes (delivered badly), beyond the average performance, lacked rhythm, was bent and edited? It just did not work. At least not at any level used as a measure for movies. <br /> <br /> I would even say that this movie shows that there are people who can be much less funny for the Germans. And that's saying something if you like stereotypes. (What I do not do, it's good to play with them, however, in case someone thinks I'm not being PC enough). <br /> <br /> Instead of going to see this movie, do something useful. Try to teach the prawns to crochet, paint your toenails in a really irritating color, dismantle your bicycle, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, become a different religion and come back. In fact, go and listen "Last Christmas". by Wham! in the endless repetition. Anything, but do not watch this horrible movie.
