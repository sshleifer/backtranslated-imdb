I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) The script, specifically, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; they must * show * the action instead of having a voice-over * tell us * what is happening. From time to time I find a movie with a voiceover that works, but here it seemed a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it sounded to me like I was practically reading fragments of the novel in his voice-over. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and I also felt that Alex Carter's performance was pretty bad. That is a significant failure for me in defining the characters of Jessie and Thomas. Without connection between them, it seemed to me that he only wanted a stallion and that for him it was a matter of lack of sex. If it had been done correctly, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's midlife crisis. In the movie, it seemed more like a simple boredom. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I did not think the movie was so bad as to turn off the television. . . although that thought occurred to me.
