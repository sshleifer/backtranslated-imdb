In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a newsstand and wants a studious young man who you are with Train station. And he's the hero of this mindless movie that's all disguised (except for Krabbe in at least one too many scenes) but he has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple, but it lasts until almost two hours before reaching a meaningless conclusion. Verhoeven has a good visual style, but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, open symbolism and gratuitous blood when he runs out of ideas.
