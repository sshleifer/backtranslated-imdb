I chose to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because I had been selected for the prestigious Competition section of the Cannes film festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so out of place in judging the quality. <br /> <br /> The film, according to some critics, has observed that it does not have too many shots, but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your small child ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to show loyalty. There are some indications of Corleone's contrasting sons in Copolla's "The Godfather" who seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of the two is as different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for addicts to violence ... there is not a great cinema here. In the best case, it could be considered to be better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values.
