The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film has not embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the total retirement was launched a few years later and that did a good job, even a mechanical orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The shadowy German expressionist colors, the black and white images of the viewing screens, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white-collar writing job, but dresses as if will work with oil. and the grease in a garage. This film decides to adopt a simulated-communist approach to the design of scenarios, the atmosphere and the theme, but the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist theme, of worshiping the humble worker. This book needs to be seriously adapted in a modern context, since this book is more relevant today than ever. I could not see more than 20 minutes of this shit. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when that is exactly what is needed to transmit the messages of the novel to the viewer.
