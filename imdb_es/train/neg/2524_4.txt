Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon that we usually associate with extremely bloody horror films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a little detour here and made a little science fiction movie. I insist on the word "small", since this is a very low budget movie, and that is where its main weakness lies. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (which, according to this film, are the United States and Russia) overcome their differences, not entering the middle of world war ... but fighting gladiator style battles with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must face the evil Russian robot fighter named Alexander. A lot of cheap stop motion animation is produced. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is incredible, I suppose. The great nations settling territorial disputes with giant robots? An interesting premise that could have been handled properly if the right budget had been available. Unfortunately, what could have been a funny movie ends up being an embarrassment to a great director. <br /> <br /> I, as a child, loved this movie, and I suppose if you want to enjoy this movie, right? I'll have to go back to little boy mode to have a little fun with him. I showed this movie to some of my friends and, as the movie progressed, to my friends, like "what the hell is this piece of shit, Franco?" And it seems good to me that this movie is science fiction from one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon. "But as the film progressed into a corny territory, I almost felt like stopping and not having to go through that torture, it could happen, because I loved this movie as a child, and I still have a bit of nostalgia to see it. everyone else simply would not get it. <br /> <br /> And I myself realized that the movie is not. " Really good. First of all. The film is about giant robots that kick each other. And to achieve this in a credible way, you would have to use some very good special effects to make it work, costly effects. that would help the audience to suspend disbelief. But, unfortunately, being a small-scale film, a small-scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this movie!), The effects only help us laugh and laugh at them. sets and part of the costumes looks unfinished or half ass. <br /> <br /> OK, once you accept that you're watching an animation mix of miniature models and miniatures, you can surrender to the movie and even enjoy the big robots that kick each other. There are certain scenes in which the robots are fighting that are great and made me go "that's why I liked this movie". But every time you meet them, some horrible effect will get you out of that little protective cocoon you were trying to hide in. And, boom, come back to realize that this movie just does not live up to its premise. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for children. You know, giant robots that are losing it? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this film dialogue had many sexual advances and the violence became a bit bloody. So I was wondering if this is a movie for children or not. After a while, I came to the conclusion that it was basically a film for children with adult sensibility, which really is not a good combination. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel so naive The childhood charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like me) well, I suggest you you move away from this. Gordons is a great director, but this movie he did, he just did not do it for me. Well, at least not now that I am an adult adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5
