When someone remakes a classic movie, the new version is always unfavorable compared to the original. In addition, there is a possibility that the new version is so radically different that it is too unfamiliar to the public. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 version of "Double Indemnity" for TV has scenes and dialogues almost identical to those of the 1944 original. The main difference is that the new version seems to have no power. Fred MacMurray was as good as the careless and carefree insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss, Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, seems almost bored with procedures. Samantha Eggar is totally wrong as the deceitful and stabbed Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyck was simply excellent in this evil role, Eggar is too polite and polite and seems out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the former role of Richard Gaines as Robinson's boss, Norton, and John Fiedler taking on the role of Porter Hall as the crucial witness, give the film some life. In particular, Webber recreates well the role of Norton in a context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the movie starts, everything is there, without life or electricity. This is a movie that should never have been remade.
