I'm a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I saw this movie after having seen Fiza, who was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that are cr * p. but this movie only takes the cake. <br /> <br /> We were so upset that they tricked us into paying our money for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, not even rent <br /> <br /> 1/10
