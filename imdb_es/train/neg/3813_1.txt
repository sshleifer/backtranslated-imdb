What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30-minute show and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have dad give everyone a lecture because that It is what he has to do. <br /> <br /> But, do not forget that Uncle Joey has to make some strange noises and cook faces, so Uncle Jesse has to show up in his black leather jacket and jeans and look pretty. for a few minutes, while everyone is discussing how mom would have done things if she were close ... <br /> <br /> Yes, full of crazy and little adventures on a lot of nothing and a very long story to build her around. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only bore you to tears, it will age you twenty times faster than normal.
