I guess the reason why this movie did so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first film since "Beverly Hills Cop", so at that time he was in fashion. Considering that one won more than two hundred million and it was R and this one won about 80 million and it was pg says it was not so popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I did not care much. This has Eddie as a kind of seeker of lost children. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is, it does not compare to special effects. I had seen better things done in the 70s than some of the ones it offers, Ray Harryhausen did better things. Still, the main reason why you see a movie like this is Eddie's, unfortunately it's not very funny in this and it seems stupid to place it in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scenes. I guess they expected a fish effect out of the water, but for me it just did not work out.
