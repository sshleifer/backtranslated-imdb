This movie blows, let's clarify that right now. There are a few scene gems nested within this pile of garbage, but none can redeem the frame of lameness. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts similarly. I usually hate Colin because he's a fairy in general but he's fine in this movie. There were two story lines in this movie: one about a child throwing stones through the windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it: this movie has no idea what I wanted to say or where I wanted to go. The lines of the story of the characters are intertwined in some levels but they are not worthy of being included in a script. Everything is weak and useless, and then there is an occasional OK scene. But, in general, do not bother unless you love the Irish accents so much that you can see the mediocrity, and everyone rescues them as if they were the elf of Lucky Charms, an American fetish that has catapulted success to some really frightening films .
