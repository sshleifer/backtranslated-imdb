"Boom" has earned some reputation. With the heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it's much worse than you could imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of "Boom" is that it seems to indicate the decline and fall of the heavyweights mentioned above. It was only the director Joseph Losey who collapsed in the depths with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some might wish to add "Secret Ceremony"), managed to recover and in 1970 he created his best work, the wonderful "Intermediate". . <br /> <br /> The saddest thing of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-1940s to the early 1960s, Williams wrote a series of plays that have gained a classical status, remaining in the theatrical repertoire throughout the world, and many of them become highly praised films. When William's muse left him, probably because of his notorious substance abuse, he left him forever. The best of Williams is the dream of an actor who offers many unforgettable performances. (Was Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in "The Night of the Iguana"?) Taylor, in particular, shone as much in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" as in "Suddenly Last Summer". There is an anecdote in which Taylor allegedly asks John Gielgud if he would teach him to play Shakespeare, to which he responded "if you will teach me how to play Tennessee Williams". If Gielgud had seen "Boom," he would have shut up. Taylor has simply never been worse, becoming an indifferent performance. Even though his face is well photographed, it is decidedly loose. In addition to the physical deterioration, from this moment on, she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely forgettable (and worse) roles under her belt. <br /> <br /> The same could be said of Burton. After his short theatrical life, he gained fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point forward (1968) would have nothing flashy. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward had ceased to be a force in the theater where the comedies of his room had been replaced by Williams' Like and the British "angry youngsters". It seems that he is having fun camping, but he barely manages to have fun, on the part of the man who claimed such talent. <br /> <br /> The only cast member who maintains her dignity is the young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years would give up a promising film career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> "Boom" stinks of self-indulgence; it's just out of control. A pretty sad indicator that the races have gone bad instead of a fun camp, as some have suggested.
