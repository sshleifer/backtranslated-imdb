It's like the title of this thread says. The only impression I got from that movie is that the character of Marlee Matlin was always angry, so cynical and pathetic. The first date of his character with the character of William Hurt where they danced was silly. In general, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I fell asleep. I would continue watching that movie with only one intention ... to overcome my problem with insomnia, because all it does is sleep. Sweet Dreams.
