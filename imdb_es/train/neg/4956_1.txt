When this caricature was broadcast for the first time, I had the impression that it would be at least half a descent, boy, I was wrong. I must admit that seeing this caricature is almost as painful as seeing Batman and Robin with George Clooney so many years ago. I saw a few episodes and two of them made Batman literally kick his ass to the left and right for the Penguin who fought as Jet Li and hit the Batman crap and I saw another episode in which Batman was kicked in the butt for the Joker. who apparently was using Jackie Chan's movements while flying in the air like a ninja. Since when did the Joker or the Penguin ever face Batman? and worse, when they were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It is really embarrassing, depressing and sad how the image of Batman is represented in this show. The animation is horrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman since my childhood, I can advise you with sincerity and sincerity to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like an aspiring Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman caricature, I recommend the animated Batman series, but this cartoon is just a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and do not waste your time with this caricature.
