Hooper is not funny, he's not fasting, he's not romantic or informative. There is no real drama. One would think that a movie about the best double in the world would have some drama, there was an attempt but it did not seem real. No study of characters, or lessons learned, it did not even seem that the actors were really having fun, they just tried to act as if they were having fun. There's no reason to look, unless you like to look at Burt and want to take an occasional look at Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time.
