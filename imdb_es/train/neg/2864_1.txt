This movie is so bad that it simply challenges reality. The filming is, in the best of cases, school material, the performance is pathetic and the director must be banished forever from making films in any form. So bad that you can not even look like comedy like something like Showgirls. The only thing that had this DVD was the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who have not had the misfortune to witness this is please do a well-deserved favor in advance and do not waste your time or your money on this piece If you want to see a movie for aspects of comedy, there are many more worthy in this area than this garbage.
