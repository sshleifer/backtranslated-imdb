They sell it like a horror movie, it's supposed to be a suspense movie, but I found it quite funny (comedy? I do not think so), I laughed at the whole movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and the plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy". I loved his performance in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams ... wow! is a beauty, and also a good actress, but let's try to be a bit objective here, the mm mm story ... the mm mm direction ... it lacks a lot of suspense, in fact, it's a very boring movie, but there's something well, although it is a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME WAS 10 MINUTES UNDER WATER!) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this film has such a high rating, and in the rotten tomatoes , even higher, what is wrong with a good, rational and objective criticism?
