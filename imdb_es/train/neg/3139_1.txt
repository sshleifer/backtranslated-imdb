First of all, as a student of the Titanic disaster for a long time and a member of several Titanic clubs, I have the right to comment on the film. I do not really care how many awards and accolades the movie won, but for me it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a semi-modal documentary film "adequate" of the disaster, but unfortunately he chose to turn it into a romantic pap. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen in love only shows, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and the public have these days. Who said that all movies should have a hero and a heroine in love? In fact, most of the real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one of them. I feel that I needed a better script and director with a semicumentalist approach and the least artistic license possible. I almost vomited in the last sequence where the "dead" lovers are among the other lost passengers and the crew that explode in applause. Is this a smart movie? Ask yourself
