Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. A sin with him is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, that's not the only thing that is used poorly in this harsh Jaws scam. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyone who has read any number of my published comments has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: if there's a cute guy in that low-budget movie, I'll usually point them out. So, let's get this out of the way right now. This is a low budget horror movie that I did not like. The performance, for the most part, is horrible, the effects laugh, and the script competes with Battlefield Earth as the worst I've witnessed this year. As for the cute resident boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins that prize without further ado. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, it's not just a toned body with pretty eyes and a nice ass ... it can actually act (well, as much as it can in this hateful movie). Now that we have the housework out of the way, let's move on. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to reveal anything) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island to filming a documentary about two surfers (established handsome boy and his friend) who sail with sharks. Unknown to them is a fairly large saltwater crocodile that lurks around the island. Croc appears, chaos ensues, and people eat. Roll end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this movie is quite big. It started pretty well, but soon became stupid and stupid. A main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heroes formulate phrases at once at the expense of the victims. Also, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain both on land and in water, what about all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think a few sharks will stay. The FX is one of the worst I've had the displeasure to see. The CGI is horrible, and they have even managed to ruin the animatronic crocodiles. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic Discovery store. The crocodile hunter. They know how crocodiles look. Obviously you did not refer to any of these judgments because of the monstrosity that you see towards the end of the movie. And what about the pirate gang / drug dealer? Did you need another reason to tear a woman's blouse? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small sub-genres in the world of cinema. With Alligator and its sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now appears that the "alligator / alligator" movies now must have their own category on Blockbuster. The crocodile was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought that Tobe Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
