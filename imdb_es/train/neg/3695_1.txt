It's not the best actor movie. The director has concentrated on projecting the actor's stardom instead of giving a good animator. It can be the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But it's definitely not worth it for a neutral audience. The fight sequences are a total comedy. The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This movie was the biggest failure for the actor. Despite the exaggerations created about the film, the film failed miserably. Do not even think about seeing this movement even if you want to kill time. You can see some cartoons instead. A good movie fan can not digest this shit for 2 1/2 hours.
