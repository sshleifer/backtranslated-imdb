At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and he ate popcorn as hard as possible to stifle the lower dialogue. This is not absolutely a girl movie. Any type that you like, is what we make sure that we will stay away. A silly story, a mediocre dialogue and a cheap-looking movie in general. I've seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the bad category. If you happen to see it, the only thing you'll hope for is the end. So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.
