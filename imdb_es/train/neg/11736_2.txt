The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious student makes a film and can not decide if it wants art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the movie he made. I can see much better movie elements in Iowa: Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to the cunning, both films had a good development of the character and a coherent plot. Iowa. This movie stumbles on an absurd ending. I have to admit that it had consistency. This film is bad from beginning to end and is not particularly worse or better anywhere. All the actors did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why do you have to prove it in this turd ball?
