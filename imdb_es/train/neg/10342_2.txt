Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible couple on the screen since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce oscillates uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly believes that he is the first and his egocentric performance in a minor role underlines the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Normally, I do not like to be so aggressive, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time, and seeing what they did with them makes me literally crazy.
