Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. The performance is weak and boring, the story even weaker. The audience is asked to create the plot totally implausible and often laughable, and they are not given anything in exchange for their good faith. The film is not only badly acted and scripted, but it is very absent in all technical areas of cinema. The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are totally unoriginal and flat. Illumination and general continuity are inexcusably horrible; Even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter, since millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film because of its integrity and religious inclinations; and who can blame them? However, it is unfortunate that they are forced to accept third-rate amateur filmmakers.
