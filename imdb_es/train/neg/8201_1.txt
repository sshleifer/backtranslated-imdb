Curl up in your favorite chair and turn on the game station, while throwing this to the waste disposal unit. Spend a few useful 90 min. living your favorite game Offline - poorly filmed - unmanaged garbage. Take some fragments of other "science fiction" movies and try to unite the parts in a pathetically weak story. There's nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but it takes a touch of ingenuity and skill to turn it into a good movie. Any money that is spent watching this is a waste, and personally I would like to recover my 90 minutes of life.
