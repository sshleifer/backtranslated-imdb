It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and something of Indiana Jones, humor is cheesy, and so is acting. But after all, it's a soft core movie, which is expected and does not matter because what you really want is sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there's hardly anything like that. What makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing, and the one that's being made by a college kid that is not going anywhere in that industry. You stay a long time waiting for a real sex scene, many times you think something is going to happen, then you just hang. The one (maybe two, or one with two parts) that actually goes somewhere is very nice. Personally I can not recommend this unless you have found it in a cleaning container for a dollar or two. If you are looking for a good movie with an argument and good acting, you do not want this. If you're looking for a good soft-core lesbian movie, you do not want this either.
