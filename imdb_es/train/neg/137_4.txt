It's easy to see why the creators of Scary Movie found it so easy to elude these "teen slasher" movies. They are so incredibly formulas. And if Valentine had been released a year earlier, I'm sure they would have faked this movie too; that's if they found some real original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine does not offer anything new to this genre, except for a better ending than the usual one that, of course, leaves a lot of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a group of beautiful young women, killing the main character's female friends, one by one, usually in the superior style. Many T & A on display, no character development, poor performance and excessively elaborate bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can not stand with this type of movie is that they pretend to be 'who did it? ' The thing is that they are not because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who are the friends who have now been murdered. Usually, something that was never clarified during the movie anyway (for example, the fishing partner of the uncle of the mother of the main character kicked the dog of the father of his friend). All those who remain alive throughout the film are "suspects", but they are more "Red Herrings" than suspects. As we all know at this point, the main character gets an unlikely escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) *************** In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but even more, you have left to think about it because the movie did not completely conclude what typical. adolescent bar road. The problem is solved only in part, and the target of the killer leader may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Will the killer want more, or were the demons really beaten? <br /> <br /> This still did not make Valentine a good movie, instead it just kept it from being as bad as ever, which does not count yet. for long. For anyone thinking of making another film in this regard, please do not do it. The originality is very important and it is difficult to see any originality that comes out of this genre.
