The first half was fine, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny that the producers even admitted that they did not have a clue to the end, and it really showed. What is really sad is that I have to write ten lines of comments at least to be able to publish this. I really did not want to include spoilers to rate my comments, since the show is not worth it. When Battlestar Galatica came out for the first time, I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, it did not happen at the frontier of the first season in being porn space. Finally they cleaned it up a bit and actually had a pretty nice drama, so I started seeing it again. But to end the series with kara being an angel of god cyclone, the same with baltar and six was quite silly.
