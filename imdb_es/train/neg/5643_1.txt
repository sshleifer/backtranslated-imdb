I have 2 home entertainment stores and I have seen many bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that it forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III compared to that of Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. His lover just died a month before his arrival at the 'Rubber House' that he had given him. Once there, she discovers that she has cheated on her throughout their relationship, but none of that seems to register with her. Within a day, she begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the caretaker of the house. Even though she is married to Dafoe off the screen, her scenes with him were cold and emotionless. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe was able to save this film from the amateur film crash that it is.
