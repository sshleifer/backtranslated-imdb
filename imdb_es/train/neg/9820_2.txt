I'm glad that some people liked this, but I hated this movie. I had a very good idea for a story line, but that's where it ended. It was badly written, badly acted and badly done. <br /> <br /> I had some interesting plot points, but they just skipped too fast, the writers needed to realize what to keep and expand on these bits. Like lying about why she was kidnapped, and getting rid of the scum. Instead, it was "what's happening?", 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie had no suspense and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent the misery or the best plans if you want suspense or turns that keep you guessing until the end.
