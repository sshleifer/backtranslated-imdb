The only reason I recorded this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I always heard how horrible it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's costumes. The worst parts were, well, almost everything else. My 12-year-old son and I crouched down and could not look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we wondered why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his front tooth. But in spite of everything, it is terrible that we could not stop seeing it, the story caught you, like a black hole or quicksand or a pit of tar, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we saw "Kazzam".
