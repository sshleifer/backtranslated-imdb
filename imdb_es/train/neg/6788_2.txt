The idea of ​​In the name of the people is good, a murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And you could expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do a good performance, unfortunately they do not! In the name of the people it turns out to be the usual Friday night. The flashbacks with the girl who was murdered are quite pathetic and, at a given moment, you can predict what the actors will say ... If you want to see a good movie about this topic, look at the Dean Man Walking!
