Today, Bea Arthur died, so I was browsing the IMDb website and somehow ended up in a program called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and I bet I watched each episode more than once. However, I swear I did NOT know that there was a program called "Gloria". Maybe, that's a good thing. Maybe, it means that I had a life as a young adult instead of watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "Everyone in the family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it has spawned a sample that I have never heard of - and one that is badly rated by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I qualified the presentation with a 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register a non-voting vote and the writers and television executives must be condemned for starting a program that had nothing to do with the air and stain the memory of one of the best programs in the history of television. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
