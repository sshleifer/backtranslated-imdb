Good performances and art direction do not make a good movie. This film is so gloomy and depressing that I did not feel any joy at the "happy" ending that involves the union strike. The attempts to make humor with Lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any film involving a brother Baldwin already has a strike against it. On a positive note, Lang is still one of the great underestimated actors in the United States, he alone almost makes it worthwhile to keep it on the VCR. I give this a 4.
