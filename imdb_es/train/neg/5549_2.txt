"This could mean the end of the white race!" a general gasps when a dozen native zombies roam the battlefields of Europe during the "Great War". An expedition goes to the long-planned city of Kennif-Angor to stop this kind of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent and honest people to kill each other by tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a bit difficult to know when people are zombies or not in this movie, since acting is so cunning. Even by 1936 standards, the acting in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a school textbook by correspondence about 'How to Act' <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter Three: Emotions ------- ------ <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and dislike (Feminine) Squeeze both fists, place the fist of one hand on the heart, open the mouth to shout, place the other fist, the palm outward, against the mouth Hold the pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable, then quickly turn the head 90 degrees from the direction of the object you hate and cry. <br /> <br /> "How to have a difficult scene, very emotionally charged with the ex-boyfriend" Explain his love for someone else. DO NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotion Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines on the wall of the studio. "<br /> <br /> To give us a break from Leaden's performance, the director slyly cuts in long pauses in which nothing happens, except that the film continues to run through the projectors, so the 35-minute story is completed with 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The revolt of the zombies when it arrives is very slow! Free from mental slavery The armies of former zombie ministers turn against their old master, slowly wandering up the hill and then stab the door a bit and break a window. "Yes ... let's go ... oh, I do not know, yes. Let's do it grrr. Frankenstein must be destroyed - tomorrow. "(Although I just found some hidden symbolism.) Jagger is shot by a native as a kind of ironic counterpoint to all the natives who were greeted by the Germans at the beginning of the film. oppressed natives do not want the End of the White Race!) The chase (you can call it that) through the backward projected swamp is hilarious and worth it just for the admission price. Roy D'Arcy has had a hard time camping, but it's totally lost, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There's an interesting moment in this movie, a nice little montage of the native zombies and white cast members who fall under the spell of the eyes evil, face after face, merge into a cross, it works, although there is a strange little flicker in the middle of each foreground as if a frame had been cut in. I suppose these must be the frames of the Neg Cutters between the gone. <br /> <br /> The best ones are observed with friends and a silly humor.
