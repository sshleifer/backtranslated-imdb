Jean-Claude Van Damme plays twin brothers Alex and Chad, who are martial arts experts who team up to bring down the gangsters responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty-headed martial arts commentator, who has no plot I can make better use of the trick of having two Jean-Claude Van Dammes. Some action scenes are fine, but this is not one of Van Damme's best.
