Okay, this is stupid, they say they are not making another Nightmare movie, this is the "last" ... And what do they do? They keep making another one, not that the next one (part 7) was BAD, but why they play us Anyway, this movie did not make any sense, it was extremely boring, the characters were highly unidimensional, Freddy was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a stupid 3-d story, meaningless! I say it I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts that I did not like, which was basically the whole movie. This is SO different to the prequels, try and try, but this tried harder, and received a slap in the face Once there were scenes of death, although they were different, they sucked big. How can they have gotten that far? Did not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? However, do they do this? It's all about money, YOU DO NOT SEE THIS EXCUSE TRANSFER TO A SERIES OF NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> GIVE A NIGHT AT ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD MOVIE POINTS: I had potential with the plot. <br /> <br /> BAD POINTS OF THE MOVIE: Terrible Acting / lack of deaths / Very funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
