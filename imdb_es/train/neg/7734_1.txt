This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak, I could not even follow it. The acting is secondary. The sound track is irritating. Humor attempts are not. The edition is horrible. The credits are even slow: I would be ashamed to have my name associated with this movie waste. Do not waste your time not even thinking about this attempt to act.
