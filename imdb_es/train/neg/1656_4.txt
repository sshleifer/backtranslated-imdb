It is unlikely that anyone, except those who love silent movies, will appreciate the lyrical camera work and the busy (but harsh) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although the sound became widespread in 1928, there is no more than fifty words to tell the story of a woman, unfortunately married, who leaves her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the forest. <br /> <br /> The most vividly photographed scene is that of the jealous husband who takes the young man for a walk in the city and proceeds to drive normally until he realizes that the man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at full speed to a railroad crossing, but changes his mind at the last moment, losing the nerve. It is probably the most tense scene in history, which would otherwise be decidedly slow and obviously contrived. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR receives the foreground treatment that its discoverer gave Marlene Dietrich, but its beauty had not yet been refined by beauticians as it was when it was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mainly of looking sad and moody as she mourns the loss of her marriage with only a brief flash of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the beautiful young stallion who regains her clothes after swimming naked. <Br /> <br /> The swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat that apparently generated. The lovemaking scene, later, is also artistically photographed with the kind of lyrical photography that is observed in most of the film, artistically. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism, and this is the kind of thing that others proclaim that the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. It's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound parts (including laborious symphonic background music) and certainly Miss Lamarr is lucky that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and, based on it, gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in his work that I did not. <br /> <br /> It is evident that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. The scene of discordant "workers" in the conclusion continues for a long time and is a discordant intrusion where it is not needed. He can not finish the movie on the right note.
