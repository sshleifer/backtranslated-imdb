Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a boy falls into a lake and they eat it. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see "Slugs!" in large letters, followed shortly after by "La pel√≠cula". PHEW! He was worried that he had accidentally tuned in "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show." Anyway, from there the film deteriorates to become a festival of killings. You see a guy who cut off his hand because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people are attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl who falls on her back in an underground corridor is killed by killer bullets. It's a pretty silly movie, which falls into the category "so bad, it's good". It's also so badly filmed with such a grainy film that you're surprised to know it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am VERY surprised that you have received the highest score you have here, because most people here do not give this type of movie any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your best candidates.
