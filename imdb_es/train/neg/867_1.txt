I had high hopes for this movie, even though I received a bad review in the newspaper. I was extremely tolerant, and I sat through the whole movie. In the end I felt quite sick. <br /> <br /> Although I am not at all rude or particularly sensitive to the cinema without flavor, I really enjoyed 'Everything you always wanted to know about Woody Allen's sex'. "Funny Games" by Michael Hanneke: the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old girl who wants to drink women's milk is totally sick. And when the movie reached its climax in an "orgy" where the child drinks his mother's milk, as well as the woman he has been coveting throughout the film, I almost vomited with disgust at the total perversion and the sentimental role that is. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as the films made independently, so this movie should have pleased me greatly. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a bad film lesson.
