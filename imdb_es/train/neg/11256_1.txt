What a waste of time! I tried to sit in 'Sky Captain ...' about 6 times, and each time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else, anything else! It's a boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing boring, and Obviously, a director for the first time, because he is rigid, and I wanted to love him, I love science fiction, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt to assent Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, what used to work for Paramount Pictures, and had written to Sherry Lansing in 1993 about the use of the blue screen for screen tests, she told me that they would never have interest or need to do it 10 years later, Paramount releases Sherry was right in 1993, but there must be he forgot his own advice when he gave this dog the green light, blue screen and effect, but not a full movie, let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are great actors (but easy on the eyes) .The performance of Paltrow reminds me of an effort of secondary school. Very bad, Ed could have worked, but only under an expert director. The funny thing is that the director of Sky Captain will continue working, even after this dreck. It's commerce, not art!
