I think Jason Lee has great potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to try to leave as a star. The plot is horrible, the comedy is horrible. I laughed twice, I think to my relief, because in retrospect, they were pretty boring jokes. I got scared by Fletch's future and had to be comforted that it was the movie that had faults, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are in vogue, but I recommend looking at the still. Photos on this website to realize that, instead of this movie. Save your time 1 star.
