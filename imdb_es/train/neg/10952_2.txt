I hate that this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they go for realism, but to be honest, I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, uhm, I'll live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with low production values, hell, I do not like low production values, but at least I have good ideas. The direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig that out because it makes things a lot more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama was essentially life with the pieces cut off. I can only conclude that this is not drama, far from it. We got to see Rosetta walking to a place, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying bags away, Rosetta walking back home, Rosetta walking to a place ... it just is not so entertaining. Actually, there is no deeper meaning either. I got so bored that I started looking for some reflections on life in this movie, but it's just realism, the most overrated quality in the business. I guess I'm supposed to love this, but come on, there's nothing there.
