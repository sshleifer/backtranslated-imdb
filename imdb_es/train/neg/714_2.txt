This is a film of tired clich√©s, although strangely childish. Is there a Nazi witch teacher who performs experiments related to science fiction in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> With the aim of creating a sense of terror and fear, the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fear. Without having any expectations in advance, I'm left with: a Buffy Xander and a monkey-faced heroine who does not seem to know how to act. He said that Adrienne Barbeau I have only met before in the much more pleasant "Cannibal women in the jungle of avocados of death". <br /> <br /> The camera and editing add to the overall impression of lameness.
