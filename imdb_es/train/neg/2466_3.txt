In recent years, there has been a great expectation for zombie-related films, often non-ironic, as well as for other incarnations of the means of resurrected death that eats meat. "Fido" is a movie that is an attempt to take advantage of that, simply a manifestation of it, or both, and falls directly into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we can see the undead in the contrasting context of a stereotyped, clean and squeaky alternative story (we are in the wake of a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves) Suburb version of the fifties. <br /> <br /> It's a moderately fun concept on its own, and maybe enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can not sustain a feature film on its own. The joke that the decaying corpses of the servants are incongruent with this idealized version of a small town is repeated again and again, and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack relentlessly reproduces the melodies of the sun while the zombies cannibalize the spectators. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar family line for a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The breadth and artificiality of the representation of "the fifties" here can not help but irritate me. It is so stylized, evidently in its "Pleasantville-inspired" form, that it becomes more evident by shaking the markers of its 1950s that actually resemble anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something unpleasant. in this respect, as if the film boasted carelessly and unthinkingly about how much more open, practical and superior the years 2000 are. <br /> <br /> Because the characters are such broad representations of the "types" From the pop culture of the 1950s, it is difficult to develop a large emotional investment in them. Each one has some character traits that are presented to him. Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and is delighted to have had to kill his father, but they are still quite two-dimensional. Actions within the limitations of this poor writing are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido, the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually imparts character and sympathy to a green monster that can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are little bits of subtle allegory: commodity fetishism, racism, classism, the paranoia of war, etc., but none of them really works at an integral level, and the filmmakers do not. Really stay with anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie really does not stop with the joke of "Look! Zombies in 'Leave it to Beaver!'" for an hour and a half.
