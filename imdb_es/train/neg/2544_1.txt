Gung Ho was a good idea, however, it is too much to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this film, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company. To America and help your dying town of Pennslyvania. Two things attack you. First, why would a Japanese company come to the United States to make cars when they do, and so good at that? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds go to third world countries to have their products made to escape US labor costs? The premise of the film is that the number one car manufacturer in the world would go to one of its main competitors (apart from Germany) and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode at that time. However, he gives a credible performance, as he could prove that he could move from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not be ashamed, but director Ron Howard can not prevent this from turning into a television movie that ends up being. Anyway, because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending, despite the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations. Gung Ho has Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel that the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this film, which gives the film a sense of lightness. The Japanese manager comes to love his American workers feel that he and other Japanese can learn from Americans. His number two man, Saito, who supposedly does not like Americans very much, does not believe it. I would have preferred that all Japanese characters be like Saito, instead of the soft ones. characters that made the Japanese. It would have made the movie more interesting.
