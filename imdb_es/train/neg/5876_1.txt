I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and, unfortunately, I chose this version. Everything, from the performance (the actors send most of their lines directly to the camera) to the shots of the camera (all the shots or close up ... there are no shots of landscapes and very little background in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I observed this during my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I missed 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
