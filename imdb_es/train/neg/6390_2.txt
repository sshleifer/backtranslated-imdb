I've seen around a thousand horror movies. (My favorite guy) This movie is among the worst. For me, an idea drives a movie. Therefore, even a badly acted and cheap movie can be good. Something weird is definitely made cheap. However, he has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene has to do with the movie at first. Something strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
