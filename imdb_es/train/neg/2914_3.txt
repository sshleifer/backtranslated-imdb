The previous title is used to present the film "Gen" to your audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie begins when she leaves her mother to begin her new job. While she is driving, we realize that she is not as close to home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as he enters the hospital garden, he sees the body of a patient's death. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All your communication with the outside world is also cut off. No exit!! In those few days, there will be more unpleasant murders. Now everyone suspects one another. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. In fact, it could have been very scary. There are positive aspects of the movie, of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. The acts are fine. However, some of them are trying to be mysterious and frightening. I think the final impact should have been extended until the end of the movie. What I am saying is that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it as a parody at the end, we should have realized that it was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it completely, which I think did not work well. It is also assumed that the most dangerous patient in the film is at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is your first attempt. I recently learned that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I'm not going to rate this **** movie * though.
