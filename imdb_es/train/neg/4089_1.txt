Warning: this revision contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Keep in mind that I said, "almost". This is nothing more than many random scenes united in a loose attempt of a story. The protagonists (you CAN NOT call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and they also steal the same for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoeroticism, which was a detour for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the villainy (which is only topless and not naked as other reviews say) dies at first, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of torture by the audience). I can not avoid the feeling that the animal The abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in an MST3K mood, you may find this, but for the most part you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead.
