A movie as bad as this one should be removed from all the stores in the world. So full of boring, bored, unimaginative characters, and with a main character with such an annoying attitude and a dry voice that constantly gives a thoughtless voice over every action and feeling, this movie has the record of the most challenging movie ever viewed. Since I had paid the money to own it, I felt it my duty to prove it and how I regret it. My head ached because of the terribly bored and useless characters, they plot less lives. A group of children who know nothing about anything, are frigid and, what is worse, have a terrible dialogue all the time, just spinning around while the main character tries to get an appointment with the girl. Bored, so much so that my friend was shaking with hate and I was red with embarrassment that I had thrown 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I did not get much of my money back. Avoid like the plague.
