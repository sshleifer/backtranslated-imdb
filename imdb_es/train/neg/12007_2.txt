It is amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the day of the premiere. I mean ... look at the cast here, the promotion is excellent, songs are good enough and the trailers are good. This makes it a full house on the first day, but only when people go to see the movie does it realize that there is no way their money can be reimbursed. House filled the first day, the movie will be released next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by 'Love Actually' is what they say, did not manage to manage the entire cast well. They tried to place big stars, but in the end they did not manage to get even an average performance from anyone. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the public can not connect with any of them. It is a great disappointment for all those who like the big stars or Nikhil Advani after his great success of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
