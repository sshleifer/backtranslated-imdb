This movie is actually worse than most of the movies I have suffered, and I have suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense. He has a terrible, forced dialogue; nonsensical plot developments; really strange scenes of 'spooky images', which look more like a high school remediation art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at most attractive women; long and boring sexual scenes involving these women (forget about what you know about virgins, especially those with false breasts); he murmured, difficult to understand the speech of some of the characters; and actually they used Killer Klowns masks from Outer Space during a masturbation scene, which should be a salvation because that movie was pretty funny, but it's not. Veden Fell is the worst in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Absolutely do not miss it.
