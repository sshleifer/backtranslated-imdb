First of all, this movie is not a "thriller". Neither is "grip, tense." It could have been so based on the script, but the slow pace of the address hinders access. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only have a * how * ingenious feeling after the image ends. That leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences with music played by them marked by some action scenes that do not catch the viewer, and scenes of "clever cunning" that inject a little more open intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish this would have been the fast-paced thriller that the box promised. It would have been an outstanding movie. Instead, Spike Lee did it throughout the finale.
