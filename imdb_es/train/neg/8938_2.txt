I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I were not a masochist, I do not know if I had survived the observation. It seems it cost around $ 1000, but it was not the money that made them fall. The acting was horrible; Not only bad, the 3rd grade students could have read the lines better. Second, the only other reason to see this type of movie is the skin, and that is very deficient in this movie. We did not even get to see the most attractive girls in the amateur. <br /> <br /> Ahh, better luck next time, huh?
