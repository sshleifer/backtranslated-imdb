This movie appeared on local television here in South Africa recently and I thought I would warn even those who enjoy watching bad B-grade movies (what I do) that this is not even fun. The plot refers to a couple who visit a house in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the film, obviously filmed in the early seventies, consists of very large shots of people walking, in real time and very slowly, from A to B. It makes the movie tedious. in the extreme and the expected reward of blood and blood never happens. I'm very curious: how many people have seen this from beginning to end?
