"I Love New York" is another entry from VH-1 (MTV Networks) that shows the entertaining side of dating a squeaky and obnoxious woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the craziest, the craziest contestant, the Ebonics contestant, and her mother, and offer them a program on this network. Many will argue, "this is a show". It's true, it's not as bad as his previous show, "Flavor of Love," but it's just as bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a sketch of the 90s show "In Living Color", where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating boxer Mike Tyson in the dating program "The Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens" For a date. Mike talked about how the date was fine, but how the odious mother kept insisting. This program reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> Men are chosen and given names to demean themselves and the woman they are dating. more (I would think that an intelligent man who seeks to go out with an intelligent woman would NOT allow her, or her mother, to give her such a ghetto name, will be ashamed every time she appears on television) but these are actors of professional reality, Why bother? <br /> <br /> I miss discovering what is so entertaining about all this. The fact that this is as false as its new implanted additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make money). Perhaps the wonder is: who would want to be with this woman after an hour? Or ask yourself if she and her mother's next show will be at the WWF! Any way you cut it, it's a train crash that you've seen countless times before, so now the value of the impact is zero. <br /> <br /> Without turning or turning it will make this a more interesting train collision, or any different from any of the others. Appealing to the lowest common denominator and for those who call a "final" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end, right away.
