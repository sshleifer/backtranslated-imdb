Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematographic effects. Half of the plot seemed focused on the value of the impact and the other half seemed to focus on appeasing the kind of audience that would annoy people to start a fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the "section" deleted scenes ", in which she is in the front office with her mother.I do not understand why they would cut it in. The movie seemed desperate to prove what he could and Domino, when speaking of the brotherhoods, would have been a highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous camera work reminds one of MTV, and it is not necessary or completely useful. Accelerating the movie just to jump a lot of things and turn the camera around something that got old repeatedly the first time it was used, it's as if the directors wanted to exhaust all this extra stuff they did not want to throw away. <br /> <br / > Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should have told me not to see it in the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for the public "in".
