The first 30min of the film was choppy and difficult to know what was going on (unless you read the book, which you did not have). <br /> <br /> If you can keep the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet nonetheless. <br /> <br /> Because of the way it was filmed, one would think it happened in the early 80's, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> No outstanding moments, tasteless, but it progressed without boredom . <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton selected this role, his part would have been better chosen with a player more at the level of the other actors to maintain balance.
