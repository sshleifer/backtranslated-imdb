I always thought that people were too cynical about these old Andy Hardy movies. A couple of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not the ones who usually prefer the pleasant to the unpleasant, so shoe films of this kind rarely receive praise <br /> <br /> However, I can not defend this film either. You can still have a dated dialogue but still laugh and cry over the story. Seeing this, just shake your head and ask yourself: "How stupid can you be?" This makes more sense than cheesy, if you know what I mean. It's so corny that I can not understand too many people sitting for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of the jam because he invents a story about getting involved with a New York City debutant as if it were the last thing. People were much more aware of society in the old days. I would listen to the term "social climber" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement I could achieve. It's absolute nonsense, of course, and it looks even more today. <br /> <br /> However, it's such an innocent and clean story and series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies) just like you. might find. Also, if you like to listen to Judy Garland singing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a couple of songs here and works her way into Andy's heart. Oh man, I almost vomit even writing about this!
