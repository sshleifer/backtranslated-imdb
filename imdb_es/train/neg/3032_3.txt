Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. Since then, I have discredited everything that this guy told me after watching this movie. It is simply terrible. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, trust my word, sex scenes are not interesting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes at the beginning was the highlight of the movie (it looks good) but everything is downhill from there.
