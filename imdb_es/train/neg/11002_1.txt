Hawked as THE MOST OFENSIVE MOVIE OF ALL, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE: Guess what? It worked, I am offended to have disbursed money to rent this. Two friends and I got bored and decided to see if the whole bull about the movie we saw on television was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this crap in us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the shitty ones, but I let myself get caught up in this one. Since then, we've beaten the imbecile who suggests we rehire him, and his film selection privileges have been revoked. There's nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the "Dickman's adventures" scene was chookic at best ... color me p *** ed. I thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason ... no ... it just sucked. NEVER LOOK AT THIS! for any circustance. Even with large amounts of illegal substance this movie would be funny. That is saying ALOT. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you appreciate your sanity, never see this movie. It is many things, stupid, meaningless and worthless, to name a few. But the main thing I was looking for: offensively funny, failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
