The only thing that occurred to me after seeing this nonsense, was that I would never get the time I used to see this, again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try to win what must have been then, the initial payments of a vacation home and then stay tuned. The wooden acting, the poor special effects, the only climax of the comedy was while our alien hero was in female form and this ends as soon as he ends his obligatory nude sex scene within 30 minutes of the movie. The opportunity to have done what could have been a decent movie disappears at the moment when Nicole Eggbert watches the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, while the police, the military and Joe do not forget that the woman who Take coffee do not use it. The handle of the cup and carries four jumpers at a time. She obviously must be from another planet. Right where I wish I was when this movie was.
