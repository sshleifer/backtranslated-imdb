The wife of a theatrical producer in London hopes to fix the American singer and dancer who stars in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who is dedicated to modeling fashion in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple already met alone, with the girl thinking that the guy is actually the producer of shows married to his friend (the fact that he is not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstanding!). Wafty's musical Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers is eventually dragged back to earth by the idyllic script of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, which is filled with youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers not only "find themselves cute", they find themselves ridiculously (he dances tapping like a madman in the hotel suite over her and she complains). The 1935 hearings probably did not care how these two would come together, as long as they did, and happy. Seen today, the central characters seem to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he sends her flowers (after telling her friend that she wants to remain "luxurious" in the love department) and she gives her farewell. . Nothing that a little dance can not cure! These two glamorous are as deliberately unreal as the London and Venice settings, but we see them simply because the protagonists are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for those who do not have ... those who do not care about the silly plot. The musical moments break the monotony of the artificial stage, but they do not manage to transcend the surrounding stupidity. ** since ****
