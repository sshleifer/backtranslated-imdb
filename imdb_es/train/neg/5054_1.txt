We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: an appointment that few would challenge. The friends and relatives of these and others who perished in the World Trade Center attacks may well be moved by this insipid work turned into a movie. A sweet and serious firefighter, though insecure, remembers what a lost journalist can do from lost colleagues who turns his fragments into a compliment. Reflect on the results. She murmurs a little more, she composes another compliment, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that caused the need for several thousand compliments are overwhelmingly sad, but this dramatic and insipid dramatization is terribly boring.
