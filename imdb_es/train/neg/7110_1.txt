Well, one has to give the director credit for how brave he was. Gutsy would be the correct term. Not only did he use a total cast of five people (no extras on ALL), he also decided to use special effects below the average with a confusing and boring plot, he too, and I'M NOT joking, put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you could die of terror !!! However, they do promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a scary limping gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen this. They like to show horrible movies, just so they know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for someone they hate.
