I will try to use words to describe this in ... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but at that time I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was 'scared' when I picked this up, but now that I've seen it, I must say, it's even worse than I thought. Why do these movies still get money? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not so good, but it must be said, some go crazy being simply frightening. But what can an actor do with a script like this? It is trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of history disappears and any attempt to find something that has not been done before, fails miserably. In a futile attempt to update it, they try to make it exciting by using the whole "big brother" theme, but it was worn out years ago and offers nothing more than a filler from the beginning. And the end. An attempt was made to try to save the film by making a ton of references to the original from '83, but it ended up being funny and, at times, a bit sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I do not want to say anything, do ... go see it, or play Frisbee ... with the DVD ... by yourself. It will offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise
