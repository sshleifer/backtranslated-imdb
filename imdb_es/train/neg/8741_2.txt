Five minutes after this movie, you realize you've seen it all before. It's the boiler room. It's THE FIRM. And it is THE LAWYER OF THE DEVIL. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the allegory of Bill Gates. Conspiracies are always good things to make movies, but why does it have to be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because, at least for a while, it seems realistic. In antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it, for example, for your boss to pay an impostor to be your girlfriend and make you work harder and control yourself? I would give it 1, but the soundtrack is fine, so 2/10.
