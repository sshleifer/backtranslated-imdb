As for the Spaghetti Westerns, I would put This Man Can not Die on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brightness and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the main role, but lacks the screen charisma necessary to achieve it. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction has no inspiration and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. There just is not much to be excited about. <br /> <br /> The exception to the distribution that I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre movie. Unfortunately, your screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: This Man Can not Die's IMDb page is wrong.) Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, instead, she's Melin's character, and I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha as Listed in the IMDb credits for the film.
