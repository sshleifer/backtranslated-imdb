My first question after watching this movie was: "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the child's perspective, it was not done well. Of course, there was a formulated use of the camera angles in the child's scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of vision. Having a "main" character unable to speak (which obviously suggests a child's mute and helpless position) makes it difficult to give that character much depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict". LIAM fits this definition to a T. The viewer is struck in the head with the typical stereotypes of the Catholic Church of fire and brimstone in elementary school. and the well-fed priest squeezing the money of the parishioners. (A stereotype that is getting very boring.) Also, the Jewish characters are moneylenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who thought we would not do it? See Theresa cleaning the toilet after her mother said "None of my daughters will clean another woman's toilet!" I'm a fan of British realism if it's done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
