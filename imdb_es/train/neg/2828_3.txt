It seems that there have been a number of films like this one released during the 70s. And the fact that he can not remember the title of only one of them is a measure of its impact. This is what novelists would call "pot boilers". They are just more than a vehicle to keep movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; More than enough names to get vagabonds in movie theater seats. Every taste in the hero is taken care of. Although one suspects that the majority of the audience was still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply discarded, and I am surprised that stars with so much money and such a reputation can be so desperate or lacking in common sense. . This type of film just adds gold to a CV. Sometimes, maybe the actors should choose their director instead of the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the beginning. That absurdly mismatched jazz music, which also filtered out every time an incidental noise was needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of the Muzak elevator. Who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene represented the smoking forests of central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees as a backdrop? Definitely a silly ball would be. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and its results would have radiated enough atmosphere and tension to raise my score to two points. This director should have taken the trouble to see 'Lawrence of Arabia', or even Sergio Leone's westerns; he could have learned some things. But, again, he probably would not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock interpreted the theme of the wife who disappeared with good results in his film 'Frantic'. It was later remade in the same style as Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion surrounding their loss and the strain of the persecution was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine could be forced to use a bit of brains and bravery, Rex Harrison kept coming out of nowhere like some clever geniuses, to get back on track every time the narrative stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the picture was pretty good, with an excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then, the silly music must go and blow the atoms in the little environment that this created. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were also devised and enforced, with such inept choreographed fighting sequences that they could have been represented for the first time years of drama class. And, of course, players must fight for jazz accompaniment, as you do. <br /> <br /> And that's all the commentary that this article deserves. Except to say that the script was also pretty miserable. <br /> <br /> Keep up with your hobby in this case. Even if it contained your favorite movie stars, you will also be disappointed.
