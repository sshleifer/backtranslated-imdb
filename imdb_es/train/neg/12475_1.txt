I do not remember leaving a movie theater, except this time. Not only that, but he was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, characters of mud, violence without a point. I did not care when the good ones died; I did not care when the bad guys understood it. Fantasy and magic were deposited in a dense liver pudding and there was no coherence. In short, good entertainment if you spend an eternity in hell.
