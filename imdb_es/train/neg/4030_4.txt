I remember seeing "Lost Missile" (actually I had an attack until my brother and several cousins ​​whose house was a guest overnight, they agreed to see him with me, I, from time to time, was the Eric Cartman of the sixties, sorry guys) and I felt some shame when the sustained surge of a million degrees heat emerged as a plot device, even as a second grade student, I knew that a simple missile could not transport the energy therefore heat or devastation for more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> Inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a crime that was self-declared. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (apart from the Shatnerismo of the actor who played the assistant governor that another person mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​an easy-to-cook missile on the surface of the Earth through the heat of its escape ... no. <br /> <br /> How did the people from "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss "Missed Missile"? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy. See if you want to drink some beer for a weekend.
