Everyone seems to be enthusiastic about the subject and not realize how the movie was made. The deaf and dumb boy is fine, the loser wins. That's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is average in general. I think it could be much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real-life event. I'm sure the movie could have been more interesting. The songs are simply put there, and I had to literally advance the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good acting, though. Observable
