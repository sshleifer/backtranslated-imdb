The film lacks credibility with helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, not even a woman before the women's movement of the sixties and seventies. Almost the only part of the movie you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies, but even if they had not, they would not have allowed one to wander this way just to assure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It is not an important thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the bad things that make the film fail. Bad direction, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) combine to make the movie fall. In general, spies should disappear in the carpentry. The suspense enters with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not, and worries about being detected. In this game the game ended from the beginning. This spy was doing everything except spy. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book.
