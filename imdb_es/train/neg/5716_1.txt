This movie does not deserve the next few minutes. I will criticize it, but I know that many people, like me, trust IMDb.com to help us decide about the movies. Just for that reason, I'm writing this. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of "The Incredible Torture Show" of 1976 (also known as "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 / . Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, everything is here together with a third degree script, a pathetic performance and a perverted failure of a black comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, however, everyone speaks English. There are a lot of girls in the movie who are horrified by the massacre of dogs in a market, but who are sexually excited to enter a porn room. A girl who is disgusted by the filth in a bathroom after a few moments, is still trying to do it with her friend's boyfriend (the way he got there might be the only interesting thing in this whole movie). The movie is absolutely horrible, even for a b-movie. Even if you download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
