The words can not describe how absolutely abysmal this movie is. It's a series of random and funny clips about everything from a stupid parody of Batman to a guy who puts on a dead old woman (REALLY unsettling). The only remotely funny thing about Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. In addition, it is classified as NC-17, avoiding the only people who could tolerate it.
