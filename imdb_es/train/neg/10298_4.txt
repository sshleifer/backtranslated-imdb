Lynne Ramsey makes eye-catching images and Samantha Morton can invoke feelings with a gesture. So, what a drag to discover your wasted talents in this way, pretentious lark! <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring Callar to life. Their attempts are too artistic and oblique. Repeatedly, her camera remains in long and silent shots of the dying actress, as if the erased look of Morton alone could supply the character. We are in a Warholian hell of complacency: for a movie that has minutes to spare on insects crawling on the ground, you may think that you could turn to give life to its protagonist. But how will she do it if she rarely speaks? Without the interior monologue of the novel, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody. No wonder Ramsey has to undress often with Morton. <br /> <br /> That said, the first ten minutes were so impressive, filmed and edited that my hopes increased. Give the movie a lot: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep some.
