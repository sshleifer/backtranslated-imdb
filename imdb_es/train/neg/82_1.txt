This movie sucks. It really was a waste of my life. The performance was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people are "terrified" by this pathetic "maddened murderer", but fail to counterattack in any way. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, without equipment, and they show up at a campsite that is already assembled and fully equipped with food, clothes and the daughters' headphones. Also, after their boat disappears, they get scared because they are trapped in the forest, but then the daughters' boyfriend simply shows up and apparently never considers that they could leave the forest as he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend talk to you so you can see it.
