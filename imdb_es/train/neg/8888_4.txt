I rated the Basic 2 High instinct, but that movie got less than a rating of 4. This movie only got 4 of me, but it has 7.3 of more than 600 people. I do not see a reason why you like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, because it almost never leaves those rooms in that big broken house. And he only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which is totally unnecessary. Many of the dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the movie is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The movie can only be reduced to a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, that one is just as boring, the dialogues are just as boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop seeing that after the first story ended. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks passion or emotion.
