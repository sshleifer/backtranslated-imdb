I love John Saxon in whatever he is. The only time he takes the camera, although he directs a movie that should have been titled "Please, do not watch this movie called: House of zombie death." The $ 1000 Bucks Insurance Certificate is Fred Olen Ray's deceptive way of making you spend $ 14 on a filmed dump produced by a major 70s cheese legend. Ray is the leader of RetroMedia. By the way, Ray makes Charles Band look sexier than stucco ceilings in a Ford Falcon. Just bad now, both of them, and also boring. It's great that Ray is unearthing these old things and, in some cases, it's public domain, like the rest of the video hucksters in dollars, but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" superimposed to add property and interest in the FOR part) THE ONLY WAY TO SERVE THIS TRIP IS TO LAUNCH IT IN THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND THE SAXON FANS! If you want to see a true Saxon, choose Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
