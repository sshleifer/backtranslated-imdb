My wife and I found that this movie is very unsatisfactory. While the plot keeps him interested and busy wondering what is going on, when he leaves the theater, there are too many loose ends that make no sense. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, enormously wealthy head of a New York bank has a terrible hidden secret. Taking advantage of the dealings with the Nazis of World War II and hiding the spoils stolen from the Jews, he keeps the evidence (including diamonds and Nazi swastika documents) in a safe in his bank. Why? If you want this to never be revealed, why did not you burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them, why keep them instead of throwing them away? How did bank robbers discover their secret? How did you know how to concentrate on this safe # 232? The Denzel Washington detective also discovers that the bank records show the numbers of SD Boxes No's 231 and 233, but not # 232. Curious. Meticulously met the time in some way to make an exhaustive search of bank records to discover this curious fact. All the time dealing with a situation of red-hot hostages and bank robbers who threaten to start executing them momentarily. Woohoo! Talk about superpowers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave millions of dollars in foreign currency in the vault they have opened. They only take the contents of Box SD # 232, apparently for the purpose of blackmailing the president of the bank. This challenges any rational attempt to find a logical explanation for what the film describes as a criminal brain, or for its henchmen with minor brains. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using her political connections with the Mayor of New York, gets permission to enter the bank that is under the control of bank robbers while holding many hostages. She offers an agreement to the chief of bank robbers to buy the documents she now has in hand, but she is not interested. So, what is your point (if there is one?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by the arrogance of all players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (detective) and Jodie Foster, crack shooter problems for high power problems. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie that I saw, "Flight Plan", was also full of holes that did not make any sense. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies. I can not disagree with her on this ... "A WASTE OF MONEY AND A WASTE OF TIME". Be forewarned. A well made movie, good actors, badly written script.
