I noticed in the comments that most of the people who are discussing this movie are basing their comments on the MST3K broadcast. That's fair enough (that is, after all, how it had its greatest exposure), but, having had the misfortune to see "Final Justice" in its original form, I would like to share some ideas and comments on the subject. version. <br /> <br /> First of all, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K transmission, mainly due to an exhibition scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (he could use the names of the characters instead of the actors, but I love writing the words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why the fugitive character of Venantini can not leave Malta immediately. (It's not a plot point CONVINCENTE, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it). I do not know if this scene was cut only for the time or because it did not provide much material for the riffs. <br /> <br /> Another point in the plot that is missing in the original: the betrayal of the Venantini stripper by Joe Don Baker, apparently unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by a previous scene, extremely unpleasant, in the one Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this gives him a reason to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... complicated. (There is no other word to say). <br /> <br /> Some of the moments worthy of MST (the perpetual truncated cries of "Son of a -" and the "deja vu" of the sheriff) were purely the result of the print edited for TV with which they worked , and was absent from the original movie. <br /> <br /> A scene that I wish I had appeared in the MST3K version: before entering the bar to ask some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese police to accompany him to stay outside, because "they see that uniform, they will not cooperate. " However, Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous cowboy-sheriff suit, complete with a bright badge. I can not imagine why they missed that great opportunity to make fun of him ... <br /> <br /> A final remark about the original and uncut version of "Final Justice": Why, oh why, what made? Do you feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare bottom on the screen?
