I saw this movie during an interim thematic class of Tolkien during my second year of university. Unfortunately, I was sitting near the screen and my teacher chose me to serve as a whipping boy; everyone else was laughing, but they were not always in sight. <br /> <br /> Let's get it out of the way: Peter Jackson's films 'The Lord of the Rings' owe something to Bakshi's movie. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty beds of the inn is almost a complete copy of the scene from Bakshi's film, shot by shot. You can call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I'm not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply that I have a little respect for this movie. I'm sure others have described the similarities: look around. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete train crash in all senses of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological way. If I have omitted something else that offended me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed, confronted with a lot of failures (and, in the highest points, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to the intensive use of the rotoscope, Gandalf is no longer an intelligent and wise magician, but a prophet of flagrant doom (whose hat changes color inexplicably once or twice during the course of the film ). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the film, without explanation. He dresses purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is completely horrible. The portrait of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin never show up, they just appear during a scene change with an explanation of a sentence. The movie is full of a sloppy edition like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry sing happily as they jump along the road. One of the hobbits gets a lute at least twice as large as the one behind his back, which was not seen before, and begins to touch the typical bard's fantasy trait, since all of them enter " la-la-la " BEAUTIFUL. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotyped fantasy tunic (no pants), with a large square buckle of pilgrim's belt. It could be said that he is the worst swordsman in the whole movie: he often has an unstable swing before being knocked down. <br /> <br /> * Black Riders seem more leprous than threatening instruments of evil. They hobble everywhere, they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but it's not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford de Bruinen (where they look at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) continues forever, during which time the Riders raise to his horses in a vaguely threatening way and ... they do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline when he succumbs to his wound. It is heavier than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is as tall as Legolas the Elf. He is a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. He also looks like a David the bastard Gnome. It is a crude but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have stolen Elmer Fudd's Golden Viking armor from that episode of the opera Bugs Bunny. It seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the similarity to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is the inductive villain and the least threatening of the entire movie. It seems that someone is wearing pink shoes and is barely taller than Gandalf. The "purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day. <br /> <br /> * Battle scenes are uncomfortable and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters show any level of competition with their weapons. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in the Jackson movie, but they're supposed to be fighting. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very brief appearance, and I regretted that he bothered to appear at all. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Good, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Part of the voice acting is pretty good. It's not that Aragorn SOUNDS is bad, it looks like Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is something interesting in this portrait; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the tempting powers of the Ring, and her voice actress is not horrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as in Jackson's portrait of the same scene, but it remains appropriately dramatic (and more faithful to his death in the book, though I do not think Jackson has he made a mistake by shooting him the way he did). <br /> <br /> * As my teacher pointed out (among whispered threats), the orcs (mainly in Helm's Deep, if I'm right) look like the corpses of soldiers ravaged by war, a political statement that works Pretty good if you realize what you're trying. <br /> <br /> * While this is not really a positive point about the film, Bakshi can not be blamed for most of the failures in this movie, or so I was told: the project had a tight budget, and it was very late in his production, he lost the creative control of some of the superiors (of which I'm sure he had not read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for even trying something Hing of this magnitude. It's just hard for me to believe that I was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy, even for laughter, unless you have already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I am sure that someone, somewhere, will collect a copy of this in confusion; If you do, keep an open mind and get all the good you can.
