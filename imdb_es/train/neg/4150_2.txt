Oh, it really is. I have seen movies that I did not like anymore, for any reason, but I have never seen a movie that simply fails in all aspects of film making. It even fails to fail in the making of films, in a way that one could say that the Hercules of New York do. It's not the movie I like the least, but it's the worst movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The action is the first thing that catches your attention. I have never seen a worse movie performed outside of pornography. In fact, I have many pornographic movies that act like a damn site better than this. It really is horrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. The camera work is amateur. The edition is absurd. I guess they could not afford the right sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there are many of them) has them driving at about three miles per hour and each scene exposed outside by the same piece of forest (and also there are many of them) actually doubles from a studio, again lending more to the bad vibes porn. <br /> <br /> The plot does not make sense, as many have pointed out. I will defend the vampires walking in the light of day because of the fact that despite being popularized by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of vampire myths. <br /> <br /> Speaking of vampire myths, the writer had evidently read Carmilla, or at least seen The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about it, and I'm impressed that such a serious film has at least some aspirations for a Gothic novel that I really like; or annoyed by their references in the best of the hammers and, in the worst, by the total desecration of the source material. However, at least 'the General' is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, you get two stars, simply because I can not encourage myself to vote a star for a movie that has, or at least claims to have, both vampires and zombies in it. By the way, I saw Lifeforce (another movie that tenuously has vampires and zombies) the same day as this, and, despite being a pretty flawed movie, it really is a masterpiece compared to this. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this is not such a bad movie that is good, or so bad that somehow it's nice, even drunk. It's just a mess, and it's not worth it for anyone to see it.
