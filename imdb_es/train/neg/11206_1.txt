Nobody is more fanatical about the roles of Geroge Macdonald Fraser Flashman than me. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, since I also see that he had trained the Three / Four Musketeers. with Fraser, which although it turned out pretty well. <br /> <br /> Not so real Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie premiered and I could not have been more enthusiastic since I was. I had read all the Flashman articles published up to that point and I was intoxicated with Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still am , but after that he was never given a chance). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! (I saw him one more time when he was about 20 years old on TV and it seemed even worse). <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogues in the books is transferred to the screen. The Flashman character comedy seemed to me to have been mismanaged in the same way that one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it. The duel and the fencing were terrible and not very dramatic. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film could not exploit the possibilities of direct satire from previous versions of the film Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <br /> If you have read the book and you have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends when Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg become friends and play a game that Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie more recently, but I'm glad I did not. <br /> <br /> If by chance Fraser read this, I can only say that I think he is a genius, perhaps the best comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it is so difficult Believe that he wrote the script for this movie, since he made all those horrible movies of Roger Moore James Bond.
