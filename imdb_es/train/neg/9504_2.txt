The only reason I saw this movie was because I had recently read the fictional account, less than perfect, by Robert Hough, of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I had not realized until later to see the movie in the IMDb that it was originally a series. Whoever edited the original 233 minute runtime to the 68 minute version available on DVD has done a great job. The abbreviated version plays as well as any B movie of the period despite the many 'duh-what?' moments For example, do we really expect us to believe that our hero dug that trap for tigers twenty feet deep in a morning without even getting their jodhpurs dirty? Looking over the titles of the chapters, I see that the number five is called "Gorilla War" and the number eleven is called "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas at all in the movie. I guess that's where some cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
