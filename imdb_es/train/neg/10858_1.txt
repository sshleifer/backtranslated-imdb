I did not know if I would laugh or cry when I saw this. Only fans addicted to Danni's garbage could have a taste for this. This is supposed to be a horror movie but there is only dirt in this. The coolest scene is the car accident, with real special effects of the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this just for studies on how bad a movie can be ................
