This is not a very good movie, but it's not a bad idea either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend and I have discovered this movie (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** MAIN SPOILERS DOWN *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is quite simple after removing all the confused garbage from the state of unconscious sleep (95% of the movie). <br /> <br /> Ignoring the trash, what REALLY happened is this: a group of friends from the school go to a rave night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone, except Cassie and Sean, die. That is the simple reduced version. (That's right, I said Sean, have patience with me) <br /> <br /> Immediately after the accident, Cassie finds herself in the hospital trapped between life and death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 oddballs and Jude) along with images evoked by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her) . The souls continue to do what they defined as: Annie, the rave girl, the 2 rare bug killers (from the opening scene), Father Jude continues to help people, etc. <br /> <br /> Then they take us very seriously. Long walk, shows many pictures (many of which my girlfriend and I still can not link) but it all comes down to the fact that it's not time for Cassie to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up. In the hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She is fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a little extra flavor by trying to confuse us again by showing a small fragment of her dream in the wheelchair being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still dealing with his traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we do not cover everything, but feel free to send us an email if you wish. <br /> <br />
