It falls into the category of "Too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously." While Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, the thirteenth or my boyfriend's back, they know they're bad, Scarecrows do not. Evil Dead set such a high standard for comic horror in an economic genre, that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at stake, as there is no hint of noise or vibration in the hull and cabin of an aircraft in the air. The repeated visualization of a 3-man image just screams for an arc of history, but nothing appears. Although men are obviously scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this movie is too serious for its own sake can produce some smiles. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs ever did a Scarecrow preview, but I do not think he would crouch so low. However, with an IMDb rating of more than 6, there are many people who do not agree.
