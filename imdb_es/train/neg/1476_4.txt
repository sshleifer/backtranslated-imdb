This rather unique movie of flying swords and fists is a decent sample of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and part of the work with swords is really remarkable. Unfortunately, the film works under the burden of a boring story and a dazzlingly low budget (check some of the set-up fight scenes if you doubt me). However, it is worth seeing, especially if you can capture it in a mailbox.
