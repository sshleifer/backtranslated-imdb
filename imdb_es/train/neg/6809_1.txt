One of the Stinko of a movie that presents a weathered plot and, to be nice, acts with less caliber than Oscar. But for me, the worst defect was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft, and especially a 747. Some of the main errors: <br /> <br /> 1. There is no flight engineer (not even a flight station). flight engineers 2. Erroneous identification of the F-16 interceptors as F-15 (there is no resblance) 3. Loading of passengers in an "aft luggage compartment" supposedly accessible from the cabin, even if there was a compartment of this type, which placed so much weight that aft would make the plane unable to fly 4. Hollow-point bullets that "will not damage the plane." 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad that I wanted to vomit. SR-71 (of all airplanes) with a pressure-sealing hatch 7. Opening a cabin door to the outside - in the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> Oh, seriously, it was just a really horrible movie, the list of the last 10 of the year.
