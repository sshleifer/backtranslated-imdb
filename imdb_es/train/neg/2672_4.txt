I can not say that I have so much experience in the Mundae films, since I have only seen a handful, but it is obvious that this was done with few possibilities, and although it could have been respectable that the filmmakers could have made a copy of Tomb Raider - from inside a garage, it's not because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing. The movie only lasts forty-five minutes, and this is definitely a good thing, since there is not enough plot to prolong it any longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks as evil as a porn star who plays a Nazi scientist), a mummy that is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper and Misty - the version of this Tomb movie Raider, who keeps her top for much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version. I must say that even in spite of its shortcomings, this movie could have been better. For starters, you have Misty Mundae, and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it is also starring the even hotter Darian Caine. The couple gets involved in all the lesbian sex that would be expected from a seduction film and this is at the expense of the non-existent plot, although that is not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a garbage movie, but the fact that it's short is your credit, and if you're looking for some lesbian sex, you could make it worse.
