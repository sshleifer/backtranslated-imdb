This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. You have to understand that this movie was never taken seriously. It is a camp, in the same line as the "Army of Darkness". AoD was silly, but fun and bad in a good way. "House of the Dead" can not be "good bad". <br /> <br /> There are qualities inherent in good popular movies, the most important of which is credible fantasy. One has to believe what is happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes very wrong. Without limits, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks credibility. <br /> <br /> Even worse, HotD does not bring anything new to the genre and repeats the same twists in the plot and the reactions of the characters that many horror films inevitably begin to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror films fall into the trap where the main characters find love between blood and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I want to kiss with a hot girl. Believe it? Do not? So, you probably will not believe it when the characters start sucking their faces in this movie. <br /> <br /> Beyond the obvious problems that plague this film like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll chose to add scenes. of the video game of zombies that are shot, randomly every time a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear logical reason for this artistic choice, but it also distracts her from an already incredible plot. In addition, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and apparently there are no attempts on the part of the director to guide the reactions of the actors to the events ... leaving the film without redeeming qualities. Avoid...
