['Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The big blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this strange film, which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this film is part of the Dogma &#39;95 manifesto, although it really seems that way. I&#39;m not sure what I think about this movie. All the actors are good. They offer very good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there&#39;s something in the movie that I do not like. The sex scenes are too long. Go from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of garbage that I do not know exactly where it is. Of course it&#39;s not a bad movie, but I will not suggest people see it or tell them not to see it. Just do what you want. If you feel curious and have an open mind, try, you may like it.']
