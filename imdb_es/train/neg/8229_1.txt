- Contains mining spoilers - <br /> <br /> I've seen a number of decent horror indie movies like The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt that Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category. From the beginning to the end, the film is full of an amateur performance that resonates from a very poor script, God only knows why the writer (s) thought of a dialogue like "No, do not go out, do not go out, she'll get you : if she catches you, she'll kill you and if she kills you you'll be dead "is cinematic quality. <br /> <br /> This movie shows very little character development and, to be honest, I would not mind. less about what they inflicted pain and torture, since they are only a group of sordid schoolgirls who have almost no redeeming qualities. All they do is cry and whine throughout the whole movie and if the girls are not crying, they argue; when they talk, the topics are completely random: about hanging out with boys or how one of the father girls was recently cremated (appropriate topics when a psychotic killer is after you). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also an abysmal display of corny and techno music during the start and end credits (although listening to the credit music knowing that the end was approaching seemed like a paradise). <br /> <br /> The camera work is frightening and, sometimes, makes the film unseen. I guess that because I had little or no budget, the director was limited to just one digital camera that resides in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to hit the audience as close as possible to the action: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very unstable camera, a grainy image and being too close to the action, it can be difficult to realize what happens during the action scenes and it is simply chaotic. It is one thing to make a film subjective, but another is to have an action on the screen that the public can not decipher due to bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is an indie low-budget movie, but that does not excuse extremely poor quality. There are no factors that redeem this movie: bad acting, bad script writing, bad quality camera work and no story. In light of all this, I decided to give the film 1 out of 10, since it left me very disappointed; to want a meteor to hit the earth giving me sweet relief. It's 94 minutes of great college girls crying, arguing, running aimlessly and having inappropriate random conversations. However, how many times can you see the girls defecating in their hands and throwing trash in the windshield of a chasing car?
