This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I expected a lot more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is halfway there, it starts crawling and everything becomes sick and predictable. The characters in the office were lovely in the first third of the movie, but we know them too well; they become cartoons, not real people. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The point is that I could endure another story of predictable love if the dialogue was not so old. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had incoherent and incredible motivations, and unfortunately that was it. Also the case of Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie ends in Dead Movie Office soon.
