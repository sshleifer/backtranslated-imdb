This movie is not worth the movie in which it was photographed. The dialogue is flat, full of overused lines and used by amateur actors who for the first time sound as if they were reading a script. The choppy and shaky movie style is a cheap imitation of the visual effects of the "The Ring" style. The characters do not even act like a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for his twin sister in his house makes his way through the front door, creeps through the house scared and sobbing and not even once screams the name of his sister to see if he is at home. What? One would think that he had just buried his sister instead of looking for her. Too many flashbacks to his childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. It is really fun to watch the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street, through the driveway, through this corner, through here, through a side view, now through a frontal view. Enough already. You'd think you're watching a TV commercial for Solaris! Terrible movie 0 out of 100. I really regret that someone who has spent money making this movie or watching it.
