I have been using IMDb for years and never wanted to get involved in the movie comment until now. This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an expert in Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious and partial point of view advocated by this documentary. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie start with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen are anchored around a few valid points and then surround them with questionable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslims, but building a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing else. <br /> <br /> For those who wish to explore more objectively some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Qur'an used in the documentary is questionable. I watched the documentary while watching another translation and the differences were surprising. I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that Surrah says that unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I have read instead: "Those who reject the Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in hell." The difference is that those who reject the Truth are those people who know God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but this is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Koran and Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called 'Urf or "normative behavior". Obviously, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but 'Urf must be a "good" behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as being a unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic law schools and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> The tradition of Hadith is similar. There are thousands of Hadith and each law school accepts some and rejects others. Using the Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which are accurate, real and applicable, is to select and choose indiscriminately quotes from the story that fit what you want to say? which is what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people will realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot abortion doctors in clinics and so on. I know that this is not the same as a suicide attack, I only understand that the justice of fundamentalism is possibly the problem. If you feel you have THE answer, then everyone else must be wrong. But if you feel you have AN answer, you can work together with other people's views on politics, religion, God or whatever.
