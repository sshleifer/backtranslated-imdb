Someone here actually compared this movie in some way with High Noon. Now that is a real stretch! I am a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his roles as an actor, but perhaps the only person who could have played this role would have been Don Knotts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have the capacity for an aspiring Western bad man. He is too "light" at this time in his life. Maybe it was the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a fairly solid structure. Sinatra appears as the big, talking child that no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story has no inspiration and is not really credible. I do not want to spoil it, but I think the end and how the townspeople react in this story does not make any sense. Another thing, these people constantly let themselves be completely dominated by some "bad boy". This is just a small city, so I am not attracted to or understand why people would let themselves be dominated that way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in the story and if I followed it well, I was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so that some other bad boy would not kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Defend yourself! Tell your name to kill you! Hahaha Stop, you're killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried it, this story did not have a logical way to go, except the one in the trash can. . Do you want to know why it is not on video and it is never shown on television? Critics apparently criticized him in 1956 and they were right: this movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet that Sinatra paid someone as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good Western where a town faces a bad guy? Try Tension at Table Rock, or At Gunpoint: two Westerns very, very good with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the best singer of all time, but you do not belong in a movie like this.
