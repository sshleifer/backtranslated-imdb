['As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, this was a terrible movie. The plot was a kind of holistic theft of several movies, but unfortunately they forgot to make good jokes. Also, it was annoying and boring and that&#39;s being nice. If you&#39;re looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of Private Parts.']
