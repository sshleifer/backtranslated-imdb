The successful writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes on a task for Sports Illustrated. He will go incognito to the training camp of the Detroit Lions and will try for a position as third quarterback. He is quickly discovered by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. It's fun for the whole team to cause obstacles in the writer's determination to be a field marshal for a series in a real game. This film is the debut of Alda and also helped Karras to leave the grill to act. In addition to the Detroit Lions of 1968, the cast also includes "Sugar Ray" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on Plimton's book.
