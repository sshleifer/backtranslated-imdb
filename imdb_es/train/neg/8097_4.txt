Considered by many critics as one of the most stinking of all time (without a doubt, the one that stinks the most in the career of director Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life is shattered. when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. Its story is narrated by another presumed type, the reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to do? be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it sure does not add much. It is undermined by unimaginably disgusting one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have the displeasure of knowing in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not finish it because it was not to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who enjoyed the novel consider this movie It is a complete farce. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many talented actors strive to give a below-average movie an appearance of quality and failure. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems start with picking the sympathetic Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Briton. Bruce Willis is wrong, badly done for the role. What was the thought there. <br /> <br /> Oh, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, and he is forced to lecture unconvincingly on "decency" after the climax. <Br /> <br /> This movie ends up becoming an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the set of talents; I'll give you four out of ten for that, but I'm sure some people will say that a much better movie could have been made from the source material.
