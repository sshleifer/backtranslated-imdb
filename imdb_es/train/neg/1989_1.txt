I would have liked to give this film a zero, but that was not an option! This movie sucks !!! Women can not act. I should have known it was going to stink when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that the channel had not changed after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as gunmen in Western days is ridiculous. It is not just a question of race, it is also a genre. The combination of the two is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some of the people in the movie are not bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was horrible. It was not believable like a movie. It could be 'entertaining' for a certain group of people but I am not in that group. hahaha and using a great line of a great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it".
