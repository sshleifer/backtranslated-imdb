This could have been the gay counterpart of Gone With The Wind given its epic length, but instead it was satisfied to be a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in history (in reality there is no story) to search and kiss. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic proposal, like having almost no dialogue, is completely wasted in a film that makes no effort to examine the psychology of its characters with a certain dignity and achieve a true emotional resonance. In addition to that, it pretends to be an "artistic" film using the worst naive clich√©s of film snobbery. But anyway, if someone can identify with their heavy banality, I guess that's fine.
