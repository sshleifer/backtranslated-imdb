The Minion is about ... well, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will open the door where his master is trapped. He is a kind of demon that possesses human beings and when the body dies he will have another. Any person who is possessed will go with rage berserker. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of the Templars, who has the task of keeping the key away from the servant. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a couple of Templar knights flee from the servant. Then it advances to 1999, where the key ends somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the servant is behind the key, and the film becomes a long scene of persecution between the serf and Lukas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie is just that, a low budget movie for B movies. The film lacks energy, and just steps along. The persecution will follow, but you will never feel involved in the story that you voluntarily take ideas from previous films (especially The Terminator films). The scenes of fight with the servant are annoying, since you never have the sensation of the good thing or how bad a warrior is this demon. "Skillfully" becomes a one man army when fighting a squad of templars, but it stinks when it comes to one against one. And it's supposed to be there for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is simply thrown down the drain for convenience. The complete idea of ​​a secret order of the Templars, a door to hell and the key is not well explained. We simply must accept that they simply exist. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that the story does not have much potential but only enough to earn a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren seems to want to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
