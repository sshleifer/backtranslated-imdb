Wow, not only is this movie a "new lesson for bad taste", but also a lesson to "make a bad movie". Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence', but at the same time, one must realize when a movie is terrible. In case you missed the story, the plot of 'Zombie' 90 'is about a government plane that transports toxic chemicals that, by chance, crash in the desert, causing the chemicals to spill, turning the locals in horrible looking zombies. The next thing you know is that zombies are all over the city eating live people, while a silly-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to discover the disease that causes these people to eat each other, hence the name of "Extreme pestilence." From then on, all we see are zombies that have a field day in all the places in sight: nothing more than dismantling and extreme and disgusting dismemberments accompanied by endless cubes of gills and gore. Since this is a German movie, the movie had to be dubbed into English and when you're not laughing at the zombie frenzy, the voiceovers are pretty fun and entertaining too. As the user UnratedX * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * mentioned, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman, who is Your baby is being rolled Around your wheelchair, a guy and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack you. A zombie grabs the baby and breaks it to pieces, eating its organs while listening to the baby cry. Wow, that's a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste. I tell you, atrocious, atrocious.
