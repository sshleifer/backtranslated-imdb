RUN ... do not get away from this movie !!!!! Directed to very young children, this film will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90s raised the bar, this movie simply dropped it. It is slow and the monster's fight is good, but rarely seen. This movie made me throw dry in the cat's box. Simply a very poor offer after a phenomenal series of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ DO NOT HAVE THIS POINT !!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why Gamera fans of the 90s series will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child who tries to deal with the death of his mother and fears losing his baby Gamera in a fight after knowing that his father saw an adult die Gamera <br /> <br /> 9. See the adult Gamera for a minute at the beginning of the movie. Does he get his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self-destruct? He looks old and lethargic. Also, it looks nothing like any gamera you've seen. His suit seemed cheap and hurried. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see in the rest of the movie looks like a Pokémon. With big, cute eyes ... will remind you of the baby Godzilla of Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the rhythm of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I saw this movie with 2 other fans of Gamera and nobody was happy with the slowness with which this film was moving. I've seen an SUV full of fat people going down a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. Final Wars had a lot more, actually, and better fights though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the lead role. The theme of all children's friend and bad writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s and the story is repeated in the 2000s. Gamera's most successful films abandoned the feeling of Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to a failed formula? This was going to be a new trilogy and the poor ticket sales killed any hope that this story would continue (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost its iconic roar. Now it sounds like an elephant with streptococcal pharyngitis. <br /> <br /> 3. This film can produce a new Olympic event ... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children to danger. You have to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh, yes ... it's okay, sending your children to a kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but below average for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was to show the Gamera fly the size of an apple. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not what kaiju adult fans expect. The director was involved in the Power Rangers and it shows. It emerges as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Congratulations if you know the 3 references. <br /> <br /> Rent as best as possible or look once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
