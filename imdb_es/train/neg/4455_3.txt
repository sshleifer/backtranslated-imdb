Where to start? Okay, do not compare this movie with the fight club to start, it's ridiculous. If it were a patch in the fight club, violence, blood, blood, etc. they would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory, which is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like a shame). Fair enough, the story is pretty decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed, with a decent ending that I could add. But the film in general is poor, seriously poor. Since people have been mentioning the accents, you should not spoil a movie (I do not agree), whether it's a simple casting error, or the lack of effort to train the voices caused the film to be irritating in every way. / Geordie was playing the role. Do not get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a fur head, but not a soccer hooligan. I could follow forever how ridiculous the football scene was: the situation of the "false administrator". Also, when the GSEs are going to play against the United States to the north, they go on the train waiting for only 3 of them, it does not make any sense, this is a true organization of gangsters and thugs, which is described in the film as something of a Mickey Worship of the mouse of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy, did not West Ham and Milwall play during the last few years they have been together in the Championship? Hmm, ten years ok. And I am sure that 'Bother' could simply get into a pub of the firm Milwall. Basically, a very poor movie that people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and vandalism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the underworld of vandalism, you will simply feel that this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
