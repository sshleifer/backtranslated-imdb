This is another incredible and unbelievable piece of Hollywood's fall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a business suit, convinces me that he was a better second baseman. Ray Liotta as the psychotic policeman is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard self, and recently to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this design is absolutely predictable until the end when Kurt touches Ray with a vase or something. he down and outside Kurt and Madeline then make their obligatory embrace at the end of the film, and EVERYONE, except Russell and Stowe, KNOW that Liotta is going to get up and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> He does it, of course, and Russell punches it 10 times with his 9 mm, which is totally unnecessary. This movie could end with the beating scene --- EXCEPT Hollywood argues about unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "improve", the more slobbering they will get.
