Ok, the first time I saw this movie was at 9:00 in Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought I would be awarded. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the monsters' mother shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going "Is that? Why do not you show it briefly a little earlier in the movie?" The plot is the mother and the son partying in the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they went ahead, you know, a killing killing like a couple of young women each, and then the sheriff or a policeman find out and get into the old way of killing the monsters, save the woman / young woman, and 1 or 2 more people have died in the process? I think it would be much better that way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and they kill him first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Also, how does he have that strength at the end of the movie when he starts killing people? She said it herself, she was too weak. What the hell was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, never, act in any movie of any actor, after all, they do everything possible. If it were not for a good performance, I would have given this movie a 1/10. 3/10.
