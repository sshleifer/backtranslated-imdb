"True" story of three girls who enter the nature of Connecticut and have just been hunted by a maniac in the forest. This is the kind of movie I would have played on the drive-drives across the United States thirty years ago, with great success. Not particularly much of anything, the film works with its low budget for mixed results. The movie can be seen, but it does not scare at all (blame some of the attack scenes for that). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget once you're done with it. Most likely, you will never think about seeing this unless someone gives it to you and says "here, look at this", which is what happened to me. If you get a copy, return it, the movie is not worth the effort to see it even if you can see it.
