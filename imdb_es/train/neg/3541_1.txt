What we have here is a movie about how the search for money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reelaboration of the gangster genre, bites more than he can chew with this. <br /> <br /> His use of modern film noir to address the issue of a man freeing himself by swallowing his pride, being kind to his enemy and giving away all his money falls on his face. When the character of Jason Statham is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, apparently he returns to Liotta crazy enough to blow his head in the final scene. Why? Basically, you can not create a mobster like Liotta's character, who presumably has reached his position in life by showing the kind of ruthless behavior that is observed throughout the film, only to be led to suicide with only a compassionate smile face of Statham's character. <br /> <br /> Before someone starts saying I'm missing the point ... I'm not. I understand it well? Choose to leave the search for riches and find true happiness and inner peace. Be kind to your enemy and this will confuse him with self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and, in itself, is not a bad premise for a story, even if it is not original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the ability as a filmmaker to carry it out. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realizes this, he seems to get bored with the story and starts inserting false clues: the scene in which Statham is hit by a car. Why? Filming some scenes as Marvel comic animations ... once again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unanswered questions left at the end of the film that you could get the whole 2001-ish about it and try to decipher them or just accept that there are no answers and each viewer will interpret things to his way Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the movie that I just did not care. Frankly, the ending could not come too soon so I would not have to sit down more than this pretentious psychobabble. <br /> <br /> A loss of two hours of my life.
