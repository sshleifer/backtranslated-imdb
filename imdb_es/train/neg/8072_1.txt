(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is possibly the worst theatrical film released in history. Nothing makes sense, there is a plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The whole movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that do not really come together, at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The action does not exist, the work of the camera is irregular and the script is so confusing that it makes the film even more difficult to see. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something To tie the movie together but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
