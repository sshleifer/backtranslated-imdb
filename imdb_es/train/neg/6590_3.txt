The reviews I read about this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to take a look. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost looking for revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts of Ringu with a part Prom Night, a pinch of "I know what you did last summer", and add a small pinch of Single White Female: now it combines until it makes no sense. There is nothing new in this plot, and to revisit the clich√©s that I liked so much has not even been entertaining this time. This movie is too close to the past, and once I understood all that, I realized that it still did not make much sense. The characters go from the sane to the psychopathic killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotyped favorites: the bored and selfish lawyer, the self-centered actress, the baseball star, the voyeur video, the bitter girl, the creepy and quiet girl, the nicest girl that nice. , a damn black cat ... and I did not care about any of them. Maybe a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'videotape' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst that Asian horror has to offer, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some spooky images in the dark, or you just want to laugh out loud at the top performance, or just want to scream "you're stupid!" on a movie screen, or you just want another Asian horror to rise up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you have seen: this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot look elsewhere.
