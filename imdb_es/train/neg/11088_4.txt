This is an acceptable movie, but it lacks real depth, either emotionally or in terms of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, and there is no real suspense either. <br /> <br /> Washington is believable to the head, but he sleeps by walking through it, there is no possibility of flexing the muscles that act for him or for the cast of support. <br /> <br /> The story simply falls a little flat, even without having heard of the title character, the ending was obvious, but unlike other movies about such injustices, this does not have an emotional impact, it does not You really care about him and the motivations of external people seem more academic. Concerned about his welfare. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotion by using the boy that is outside and that the hero loves Carter, but this seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that's fine, but it's forgotten instantly. .
