I just rent and watch this movie just to see what all this fuss is about. So here are my reactions to it. It is easy to see that this is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main argument of this film is about a woman who takes revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done correctly, could easily become a really provocative movie. However, the film does not surprise or bother me at all. It just bored me. This movie can be easily shortened to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mainly available to complete the time, such as the scenes of landscapes and some scenes that I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find the scenes of rape quite docile. I do not know if I've seen the cut or uncut version, if there really is such a version. I also found many plot holes within the plot already badly written. Here is a list in my mind. <br /> <br /> Why do rapists not rape Jennifer during the night when she left her house to find out what those noises are? That would be an excellent moment. <br /> <br /> Why not just rape her in a group, instead of delaying the pleasure of some of the rapists and lengthen Jennifer's ordeal for so long? It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way. <br /> <br /> It seemed really stupid to me that the rapists left her in the forest and returned home. Maybe to prove that these rapists are really imbeciles. <br /> <br /> These rapists should know at least that if you want to do a dirty job well, you should not send a cowardly asshole to do the job. <Br /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that appears in the minds of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did not these rapists smell the danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a thin woman like Camille can pick up a tree man and hang him up. ************************ Finish the spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, This film is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I hear one of the funniest phrases I heard recently when Matthew protested to go back home and kill Jennifer: "Why me? Why me, nor I even did it?
