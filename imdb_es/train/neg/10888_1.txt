This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The story almost does not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and special effects only make you laugh. The only notable thing about this movie is the appearance of Rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie was supposed to be a comedy, I did not understand the point. If you want to watch this movie: please, get drunk first and then get ready to laugh well ... especially when the first special effects appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like trash movies made cheap: this movie is a must for you.
