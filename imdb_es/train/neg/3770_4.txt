Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn the famous Chester Gould comic strip into a live action caricature (with Beatty himself led as the square-jawed detective) had sweet proposals of innocent nostalgia, something unusual and intriguing from Warren Beatty . Unfortunately, the image is a ham requirement, fun for a while but eventually exhausting. Dick Tracy tries to take down the mobster Big Boy Caprice, helped by the love of Tess Trueheart but stumbled by evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning stage design and art direction is wonderful to absorb but, as the plot rushes along (no real predisposition in writing), things start to freeze . Al Pacino got a surprise as an Oscar nomination as bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (which is mainly used as a decorative accessory) sings "Sooner or Later (Later, I always get my man)" by Stephen Sondheim, who won the prize for the best original song. Much heart, thanks to Beatty, who was dedicated to his vision, but the image is too cold and calculated. It lacks heat. * 1/2 of ****
