Anyone who has seen Comedy Central around midnight in recent years has probably seen ads for this movie. The first time I saw ads for this movie was in 2001. It seemed like it could be fun, but I was not willing to call the number on the TV screen and ask for it without seeing the movie first. I thought I would wait until the movie was available to rent it at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was on Tower Records and on the "DVDS for less than $ 20" stack, there was a copy of this movie. When I saw that the DVD cost only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I got home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the laughter to begin ... and waited a little longer. The laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with almost all the other comments on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is a heinous piece of junk and, in my opinion, is the worst movie of all time. Starless.
