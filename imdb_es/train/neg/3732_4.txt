Maybe because I was very young, innocent and washed with water when I saw her, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since I was in seventh grade in a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression ... and most of my friends. It fulfilled its function, at least until we were of sufficient age and knowledge to analyze and create our own opinions. She was particularly terrified of what newly converted Christians after the rapture had to endure when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to spoil the film for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still see them in my head ... and it's been 19 years.
