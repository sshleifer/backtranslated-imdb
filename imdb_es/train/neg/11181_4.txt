The film is about two stories: one is the political murder of a prostitute, the other a political party of the upper class. The crossing point is the public relations character played by Al Paccino, since he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the night. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without decent dialogues and the void of direction in any sense of the drama, Al's performance is memorable: how many companions can be as convincing as a powerful and feared man (like " The Godfather ") as here as a small servant (see also" Donnie Brasco "). /> <br /> Actually, the big young lion has become a tired old man. This passage of the ages is very moving, because it makes the audience think about aging too. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up because he can regain his energy in the Church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's good that the movie is so horrible because it puts the starlight on Al's talent.
