As the summary says, you just made the most ignorant comment I've heard about a role-playing game. Did you really think they were gay? You are retarded? If you went to save your best friend and someone decides for the kindness of your heart to help you, then you are in serious debt to that man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other they made more friends as friends. They were not gay lovers as if they were hooked. And to let you know, the game takes place in a medieval period of time. Back then, women simply prepared meals while men fought. Do you know your story? Do you know how long it took to be accepted women in the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, although it is too slow to capture it, and you really need to spit some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your wrong act to interpret the story.
