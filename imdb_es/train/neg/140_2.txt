Valentine is a horrible movie. This is what I thought: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very wrong. Katherine Heigl can not act. The other one was not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, part of the music was very good. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name `Paige Prescott 'Do you recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I do not see Valentine. It is a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
