I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is a failure. Everything has a canned, false environment, in the sound, with a really horrible projection on the back screen. He has a good idea of ​​the plot that the scriptwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script, which makes it impossible for the audience to immerse themselves in the action and really care about any of the characters. The address is pedestrian, and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I have seen a lot of completely nice "sound productions" before, but this is not one of them. All he does is make me appreciate even more the high quality Scott / Boetticher movies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, trimmed and shines with that million-dollar smile. It is always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. Other than Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of how much I enjoyed Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's film, "Rocky Mountian." In "Man Behind the Gun," she's just as beautiful, and you can say she's a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty silly lines, and the blockade that the director gave her was really horrible. I've only seen Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific," and he plays exactly the same character here ... an arrogant pain in the ass that you want to knock down unconscious. I guess that proves he's a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some unconvincing attempts at comic relief that, in my opinion, only detract from the film. Although there are many elements to play, I must say that I really enjoyed the two songs in Spanish sung in the musical numbers ... but that's not why we're going to see the Randolph Scott movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse Scott films, and this is certainly not unbearable, but neither can it be considered anything other than mediocre.
