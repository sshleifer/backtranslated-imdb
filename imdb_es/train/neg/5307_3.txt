What happened? "Doubt" had a lot of potential to be a brilliant film, but instead it wobbled with a simplistic plot that made me want to stop seeing. The only thing that the film had in its favor was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who did not DOUBT deserved the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of their best performances, it still gave us a solid and sincere character that blossomed through the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even the brightness of a screen legend could not prevent this movie from going ahead. downhill From the boring start, which had no power or hit, until the end less than convincing, the film was a real disappointment, especially because it offered much potential through its promotion and progress. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and ended with a boring film, which lasted for too long, with too much talk and without enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means worthy of an Oscar. (Especially since they left the performances completely like Will Smith, in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Seeing Amy Adams was like looking at a cardboard box, as it was unilateral and simple. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, since I'm sure she would have left victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination. <br /> <br /> In general, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films. of 2008. It was a movie disaster with a lot of potential, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, who despite offering surprising and solid performance, does not even do enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
