I saw the whole film recognizing the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I have no idea of ​​Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie I said "ESE was Peter Weller?" Congratulations to Mr. Weller for his excellent performance. Weller played an important character, and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was bad, the writing was bad and the performances, apart from those of Nosbusch and Weller, were unsatisfactory. The landscape and the surroundings were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, of a possible 10.
