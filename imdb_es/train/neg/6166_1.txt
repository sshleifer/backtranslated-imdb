I do not recommend this film, because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in Algerian Berber territory, it was filmed in the south of the Tunisian desert, (completely different culture, I know I'm from Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element he was the character of his aunt companion, he speaks in the film with a very eloquent Frenchman, a university-level academic French, while the character he plays was supposed to be of a disturbed person who never gave up his type of mountain character, what to live as a Bedouin with that kind of education and that context is impossible. The most shameful and disrespectful scene, especially for the people of the region, is the "repudiated woman" segment, which is a pure invention of the writer / director, things like that will never happen. an Algerian society ever !!!
