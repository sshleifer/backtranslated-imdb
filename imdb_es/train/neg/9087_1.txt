Canadians are too polite to boo, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this 0 or 1 movie on their voting sheets. The premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a seventeenth-century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherds set in the distant past when the druids were spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms that include silly and impractical dress and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. The lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to the idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing situations arise and a variety of ridiculous situations. The movie could have been hilarious as a piece of Monty Python, to which it looks too much, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience laughed at the jokes in sight, but otherwise lamented the slow pace. The end arrives in a hurry and is really horrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of time from your movie.
