This could be incredible, but this movie has raised $ 878,138 in Russia! It's shown in almost every movie theater and it's still working! Well, I have no idea why the distributors look at this particular "movie", which is almost not screened around the world. That is a kind of enigma! LOL! Maybe it was based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was also released on DVD almost everywhere, had major screenings in Russia and raised more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films had a lot of promotion, such as banners throughout the city, television ads, etc. Speaking of movies, I'd say it's boring and absolutely boring. It could be better, really. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
