The character of Jack Black, Tim Dingman, the "Dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​a "Vapoorize" spray that when sprayed on dog droppings, causes the poop to disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I expected Vapoorize to be a real product so I could spray it on this "stinky" movie and make it disappear into thin air too. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (that honor is for The Cat in the Hat), it gets the honor of a close second. <br /> <br /> It's not funny, not sad, not nothing. A true "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> At 0.2 out of 10 !!
