Let me start by saying how much I love the television series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man apparently unable to pursue his dreams because of his dominant and manipulative father, he was incredibly cheerful and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the best British comedies of all time. The television series has my rating of 10 out of 10 without reservations. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this derived film is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Almost none of the essence of the television program is transferred successfully to the film. This movie has a depressing and very sad tone that almost made me cry on several occasions. Seeing Harold being hit in a pub (and not comically) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but it's definitely one of the reasons why fans of the television series are not going to like this movie. The movie was painfully not funny, except for the scene in which Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tune and I wonder if the producers of This movie never bothered to watch the TV series. In the television series, Harold always chased respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to the comments made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely invaluable in the television series. In the movie, Albert says practically nothing when an opportunity of this kind arises. <br /> <br /> Most of the spin-offs of British comedic films tend to be quite boring, with the notable exception of ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than your own TV series!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to be located right at the bottom of the stack, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND ARE RIDE AGAIN in place. It has a much lighter tone, it's more faithful to the television series and it's really fun.
