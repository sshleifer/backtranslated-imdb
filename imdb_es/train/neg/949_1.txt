I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is deficient (Debra Jo Rupp is a notable exception), the arguments of most episodes are trivial and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are not funny and it is painful to try to sit through even half a episode . In addition, the link between this program and the '70 'is extremely tenuous, beyond the style of dress and the stage and background used for the program; it seems to be nothing more than a modern comedy with the same old and carefree scripts as modern comedies. They have disguised themselves as a show twenty years ago hoping to win nostalgic spectators or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more effectively and actually it's a pleasure to see them in contrast to this horrible and pathetic excuse for a show.
