I read some comments on the Internet about this movie as "... more difficult than Hostel ...", "the camera never shows when it is really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera is never projected on the screen, because there is nothing to show on the screen. The same scene repeats itself hundreds and a hundred times again. The women are at a table, the murderer rapes the women a couple of times, the murderer cuts the women to pieces (you never see this during the whole movie!). The police come and stop him. The murderer cheats the jury. Movie about. In Germany we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". In short, one of the most boring movies I've seen. Absolutely not recommended.
