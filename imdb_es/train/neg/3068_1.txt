Films like these are for the originals what Rock Oriented Album stations are for what music used to be: repetitive, boring and exhausted from all the original energy by a corporate drones committee. I am happy that Aragorn has not been typecast as an expectant psychopath by this P.O.S. Go back and see the 1971 version, count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version and thank any deity who loves that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and film an original concept movie that was not based on the ideas of another person, and was not approved through a corporate board before he saw the light of day.
