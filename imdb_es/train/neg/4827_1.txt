If this film tries to dissuade people from using drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and nothing really happened. This movie is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of methamphetamine users. This movie can win a prize for using the word "F" so many times and so uselessly. It was not well established, but I felt that they were doing Meth to replace Meth that they owed someone. Hector got worse and more paranoid as the movie progressed and the girl became more desperate. The end really did not make sense. The movie made no sense unless it just showed how annoying it is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a methamphetamine head. I trusted the other comments when I decided to watch this movie and the rating of this movie should be a much lower average.
