This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half of the movie is animated, the deaths stink and, above all, I was ready to SEND to the people who made this movie! PLEASE DO NOT LOSE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE BY LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE. The only good part was when the movie ended *******! This movie is 50 percent of Jurassic Park, .1 percent of Sabretooth and 49.9 percent of DUMB! Please, do not waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it. Do you want to know why this movie stinks? Well, the cover went wrong, the graphics were an aspiration, the blood looked (I mean, it's ketchup), the people tried to swell, the college students think all that and can face the animal. I mean, there was a 5-foot tiger running straight at a woman, she throws a spear from 100 feet away! Wait until you can really hit him! The performance was also horrible. Jurrasic Park is really a good movie, and this just had to go and ruin it.
