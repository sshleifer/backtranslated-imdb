... except Jon Heder. This guy swallowed the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot sounded entertaining. A vague 29-year-old son (Heder) still lives with a widowed mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but whoever chose Hader would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. Heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act and make this guy pleasant in the end. In the end, you still want to be able to personally hit the guy and you are upset by the end. In the future, all movies with this type will be a no go for me.
