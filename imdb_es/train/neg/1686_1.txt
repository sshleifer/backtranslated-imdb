Imagine that your date asks you what movie you want to see and remembers seeing a very interesting trailer about "The Grudge". Then, in good faith, you recommend watching that movie. It's the Halloween season, after all. And he did it last weekend at boffo's box office, so it must be pretty good ... so that's it. <br /> <br /> And, in fact, you're in shock when the movie ends like it does, and you hear yourself saying audibly, "that can not be the end of the movie ..." But , unfortunately, it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine leaving the cinema embarrassed and ashamed to recommend a movie dog. You think your date thinks you're an imbecile for suggesting such atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that we both laughed because of how bad it was. I do not see any future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and I suggest that you limit yourself to television in the future. Actually, it will not be long before I'm sent to the flea market conventions that sell Buffy souvenirs, and it can not happen soon enough, if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot did not make sense; The continuity was terrible. It is evident that the whole ending was created to have a "Grudge II - The Return of 'Cat-Boy'".
