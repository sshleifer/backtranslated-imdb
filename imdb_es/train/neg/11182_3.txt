Very silly movie, full of stupid phrases and Jewish references through. It was a serious movie but it could not be taken seriously. A family movie plot ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An atrocious secondary argument, involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too regimented. I have noticed that Al Pacinos' acting skills seem to be going downhill. A troubleshooter with problems, but nothing more disturbing than the awful accent of the Pacinos in Atlanta. Damage control needs to fix this damage of a movie. OK, my phrases are bad, but not as bad as the ones in this movie. This movie is not only boring but also disgusting. Usually, a disgusting movie can be seen for the wrong reasons. This movie can not be seen. I managed to sit through this. The plot, if written a little better, with, perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrible secondary plot, and even more foolish jokes, could have taken this suspense movie out of the crisis. What we have left is a dull and dumb movie that made sure that it got into our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. A shame for all good Jews everywhere.
