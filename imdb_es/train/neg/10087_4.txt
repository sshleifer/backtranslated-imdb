This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in later films by O'Leary, he was played by actors much younger than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by actors of known characters) gather in an old house (on a rainy night, of course!) to talk to a rich relative who goes into a coma. <br /> <br /> While they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious events happen, including a couple of murders. <br /> <br /> A spooky movie; worth seeing
