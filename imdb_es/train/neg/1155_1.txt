never before a movie prompted me to write a review, but this was very serious. I stayed with her trying to find out what this movie was about that made Snoop choose it as her first serious role, but frankly it was a bad choice. I made a good book, but it certainly did not work for me as a movie. I found it incredible, it lacked atmosphere and I found many of the spooky scenes. A musical teacher may be no more than a serious actor who knows nothing. The performance by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to lead a weak plot with a weak dialogue. maybe I just did not understand the point, but for me it did not fit in any genre, did not provoke any empathy with the characters or create any suspense, in fact I found myself praying for the end and repressing a deep I wish to slap the three main characters!
