There are many obvious exaggerations associated with this movie. Let's face it, however, the main reasons why anyone would see it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I'll say the filmmakers did a good job of making the ship look nice), but it even has several major flaws. For example, just before the ship sinks, you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I LOVE the REAL Titanic story, but find this movie an insult to that story. The editing was atrocious: there is no reason for a film to last more than 2 and a half hours (with the exception of MAYBE, a biographical film), and the writing and the script were horribly affected. <br /> <br /> I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is a scene that stands out when the ship sinks and a serious music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the movie. As for the mood in everything, it was very boring. I felt more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know can not be what the director intended. <br /> <br /> In a few words, it seems horrible to me that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into a general story. promoted chick movie.
