So ... we get additional images of Brando ... interesting things but not exactly worthy of Oscar. Susannah York was barely a stoop. The new scene in which Lois discovers that Clark is Superman is a bit unbelievable, since he does not realize that there are targets coming out of the weapon instead of real bullets. The real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then thrown him to the floor, but forget ... let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more logical sense. The president talks about Zod "destroying" the Washington Monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Adjusting that scene made that line quite absurd. Superman's "press freedom" line sounded silly compared to "..Care to leave," which delivered better and had a proper connection to Clark's earlier scene at the truck stop. Then there is the ending with the effect "to turn the world to go back in time". He turned everything around in the movie and made you wonder exactly where the rocket aimed for Hackensack, N.J. was, since it no longer frees Zod or the company.
