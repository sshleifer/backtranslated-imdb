Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this drowsy slasher, and the light quickly fades away. If it's not her, that's another reason to see this. Five university students signed up to prepare an old dormitory for the expiration date of the demolition. Problems occur automatically when a strange homeless man requests, and the group are few people. Then, a murderer is loose. I honestly wanted to say that I would enjoy this. He had an established fair, or maybe there was only Daphne Zuniga in it. The film is too slow, and almost as silent as a library. Most of the performance is below average, and the moments of "point of view" are so old news. Acclaimed composer Christopher Young from films such as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" got this score, in a repetitive line that was best made for a television movie. Still, it seems higher than the movie deserves. Then, apart from Young and Zuniga, this scrapes the bottom of the barrel.
