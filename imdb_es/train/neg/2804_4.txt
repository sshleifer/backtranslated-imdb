I've probably been spoiled for having first seen the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is a disappointment. I just did not get any chemistry between the 2 main stars. A lot of theatrical performances and looks just do not do it for me, and what was all that about putting Tim in the role of Rochester? The casting director had read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not. And Zelah was just, well, strange, a mix of a couple. In their favor, the cast was pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but in general they did not capture any of the magic of the novel. Certainly, I would not ask anyone to see it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointment!
