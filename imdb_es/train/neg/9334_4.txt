A good movie, set in Mexico, about a hitman (Scott Glenn) who hooks up with a struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a coup. Do you pay them to take you to the border? but things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> It starts pretty well, but quickly fights and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The eventual turn relationship is misconfigured and hard to believe. An absence of passion, and essentially no reasoning behind it leaving one man for the other, made him ridiculous, and the ending was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the agent of the United States who is following the sicario's trail, but seems a little confused as to the boredom and slow that is the script ...
