By granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN, however, earn a place near the end of any cliffhanger list, without the style, imagination and atmosphere of their predecessor of 1943 , BATMAN. <br /> <br /> The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as the "King of the Quickies" and, like its director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than by generating enthusiasm. (Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman series, starring Kirk Alyn, with its animated flight animation, canned music and bored support players). The opening of each chapter offers a sample of things to come: completely inane titles ("Robin Rescues Batman," "Batman vs. Wizard"), mechanical music and our two heroes stumble towards the camera looking around, confused or having problems to see through their cheap Halloween masks. The Batman hood, with its devil horns and eagle's beak, fits so badly that the double must adjust it during the fight scenes. His "utility belt" is a strip of wrinkled cloth without compartments, from which he still manages to get a torch and an oxygen tube at critical moments! <br /> <br /> In any case, the main players are an error. Robert Lowery shows little charm or individual style as Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He creates the impression that he would rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, like Robin, has considerable difficulty managing his limited dialogue. He's too old for the role, with an even older specialist who replaces him. Without clothes, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as the tired businessmen who take a drink, without an ounce of the obvious chemistry between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although the series were not known For the development of the character, the previous BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. It offers a group that follows the movements, not that the filmmakers provide much support. None of the thugs stands out, and are directed by one of the most boring villains of all time, "The magician." (What a great name!) Actually, they are led by someone who carries a curtain, a shawl and a sack over his head, with a bent voice that desperately tries to sound menacing. The "main suspects" - an eccentric teacher, a radio station - are simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Even the "usual" comics established are superfluous. It is difficult to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers she faces, Vicki shows virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not very bright. Unlike the previous series, Alfred the butler is a simple walk-on whose most important line is "the residence of Mr. Wayne". They are accessories for an incoherent, misunderstood, tricked-out plot, swallowed up even more with uninspired, repetitive music and amateur production design. The exterior of Wayne Manor resembles a suburban middle-class house in any sitcom, the interiors are those of a cheap roadside motel. The Batcave is an office that needs reforms urgently. (The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!) <br /> <br /> Too bad the filmmakers have not been able to invest more effort in creating an exciting adventure. While the availability of the two series on DVD is an advantage for any serious "Batfan", one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations in the box. They capture more the authentic humor of the comic than the 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined. <br /> <br /> Now, for good news, this is not the 1997 version!
