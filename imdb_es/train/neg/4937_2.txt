This is a 30 minute show about a joke. The joke, the cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha!!! He can not dial a phone because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as intelligent as human beings. Oh dear, those cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. You can only run this joke for so long and have already done with Geico commercials. This program does not deserve a space of time on national TV. <br /> <br /> This program tries to be difficult, but it is not. Seeing this program, I thought I was trying to be like a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". Which means they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The caveman who cries is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not understand why I do not care.
