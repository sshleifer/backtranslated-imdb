'The Fox and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary 'March of the Penguins'. It centers around a young woman (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her blossoming friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> Here are some really fascinating moments; badgers prowling, a lynx chasing the fox through a snowy forest; A particular scene when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times. However, there simply are not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; The cinematography is dazzling. The bubbling aspect of the movie is wonderful. It is undeniable that it is a very exuberant production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that already exists has been little nicknamed. The score is also too fluffy, or at least it's for my taste; and the script, although subtle, apparently jumps from one stage to another, in the end it leaves me almost baffled. <br /> <br /> While there is a good moral in the heart of the film, and quite quiet interpretation of Noël-Bruneau It is quite adorable, the real star is the fox. Those captivating moments focused solely around our little hairy friend are tremendous. However, again, there simply are not enough. <br /> <br /> - To keep up with the latest in movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray. com.au
