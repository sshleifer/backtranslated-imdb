At first glance, this film has everything a psychopath wants: a vampire story with a "no less than 18 years" restriction, full of hyperviolence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), fanatical fans and even a gay necrophile. police! But then, this movie is a succession of bad history (very thin), bad acting (with a ridiculous English accent that makes you think you're seeing a bad Monty Python), bad music (80s hard rock), the video is horrible, the end is a real shame ... Also, the sex scenes are ridiculous, the blood is not very impressive. And those vampires are reflected in a mirror, and they do not even fear the light of day! You can be very disappointed, unless you see it as a "space riot" or "Troll 2". I hope that Bloodlust will one day reach the bottom of the 100, because that is his real place. <br /> <br /> I would say it can still be fun to watch it, if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> <br /> 3/10
