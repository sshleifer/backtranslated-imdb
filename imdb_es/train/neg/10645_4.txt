I had never seen a Tarzan movie, so when I saw it on TV, I thought about trying it. Unfortunately I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and a little overweight. Not as I had imagined Tarzan would look. And, unless I missed it while I made myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional cry of confusion. Tarzan was also missing, swinging through the trees, leaping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, many expectations. Anyway, Jane was there, the monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good boys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but nothing good either. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to present to Tarzan: 4/10
