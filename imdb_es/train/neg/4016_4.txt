There is a DVD published in the United Kingdom in 2002, code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disc, no IFPI code on the inside edge. <br /> <br /> Probably a download from VHS. <br /> <br /> It does not make much sense to comment on an adult movie. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I've seen it in Pensylvannia in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD does not have special features or subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape as a source
