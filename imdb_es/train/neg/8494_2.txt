While waiting for a combination of science fiction and vintage films about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc., I was disappointed by this film of meaningless pseudoscience and a mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of the Mathematics, technology or history that constitute the theme of the film, but is working from a kind of diffuse artistic impression of them . This hits me with pain, because for a long time I have been irritated by the tendency of the arts to concentrate and misuse the terms and ideas of science to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "The waves of Information has a half-life, "Ada:" I'm not entirely sure that half of life is better than no life. " <br /> <br /> This movie does worse than not entertain, it misinforms. The only redeeming value that I can imagine is that it could attract the viewer to learn about the subject that distorts so badly. I think it's more likely to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.
