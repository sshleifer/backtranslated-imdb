Elvis has left the building and is lucky because he did not have to see this nasty stinker. Scene after scene, director Joel Zwick finds ways to make a non-funny script even less fun. Filled with death without grace, gay characters and jokes jokes, this movie is more desperate than fun. This is the kind of movie that makes Kim Basinger follow Doris Day to his early retirement. Let's remember her as she was (talented) and not in what she has become. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize his talents at every step. The boy who plays Elvis looks more like Gomer than the King. The only really good thing about casting is the young woman who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to look for the Tom Hanks cameo. Cameo is not that funny, but at least it's not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has incriminating photos of Hanks or something that would make him make this movie.
