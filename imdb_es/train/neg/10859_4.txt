This is another one of the many films of B minus labeled as film noir with the hope of generating some interest in something that lacks it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The performance of the three drivers is made of wood. I suppose that John Dall was expected to go somewhere in the movie business, but then someone realized that he had little talent and, therefore, ended up working in television. Lee J Cobb, who is usually great, can not overcome bad writing and bad direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a fatal woman, but she does not convince viewers. The movie has two of the strangest looking cars I've seen, the one that John Dall pursues with Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. The DVD transfer is typical alpha.
