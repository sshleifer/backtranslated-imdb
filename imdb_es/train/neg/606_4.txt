The potential was there. I saw Creep and I thought: 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. However, somehow the interesting plot lines ended without explanation or ignored, as if they had never happened. The main character was annoying throughout the film, and at one point my partner and I screamed that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely spooky / frightening moments, but these are very overshadowed by the moments that bothered me so much. It's another one of those horror movies that comes up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The only savior of this The movie is the bad guy, but when the bad guy is nicer than the main character, you know you're about to lose.
