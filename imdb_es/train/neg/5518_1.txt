I have not seen this, and I do not intend to see this movie or any other that includes Lindsay ...... unless and until "the poor rich girl" straightens her life for a period of 2 years, starting with most recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone who has gone to see ANY of Lindsay's recent films. I imagine that 2007 will be the highest mark in her career as a filmmaker, until she fixes her performance. All recent advertising has only hindered his film career, if he has other aspirations to make more movies <br /> <br /> Up to this point, film producers have actively sought out Lindsay for the roles in his next production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions and compete for ANY function. His reputation is currently "poisonous" and it is very possible that it will have a negative effect on the sale of box office tickets in whatever movie he is in. <br /> <br /> Sooooo ... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not being wanted" ... will she be able to handle this? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want Lindsay to return to his television show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is simply my OPINION. I do not have internal information.
