Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching our Navy perform rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have discovered it before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is strange and unrealistic. The acting was pretty good, as they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you're going to stretch very far away from what is likely to happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken very seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker and Dracula also on board. The movie was full of familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit because of the drama, but it hurts the quality of a movie when a serious subject becomes a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. What I like the most about movies about air travel is that everyone moves by chance. They walk with drinks, place them and pick them up 5 minutes later, as if they were in a building or something, and act as if the turbulence did not exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but the suspense does not have to include a 30-second shock after hitting something. Anyway, skilled actors and actresses prevent this weak script from becoming a movie that was preserved after its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person dressed up ... :)
