I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time it felt fulfilled. Night Listener is undoubtedly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this movie, I did not care about any of the characters, I did not like it. to the whole plot of mysterious type, did not care how it ended ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no emotion, no suspense, nothing. Highlights include (no spoilers: nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking in a hotel room, a car passing through rough terrain and a truck emitting a beeping sound . <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and waited for a similar and mysterious role for Williams, but unfortunately I was disappointed. What is most disappointing is that I am sure there is a good movie somewhere, the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I could have even given it 1/10, but that score is reserved for the new version of The Producers
