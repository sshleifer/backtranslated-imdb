The performance, despite other criticisms, was remarkably well done. Brad Pitt handles quite well the role of an annoying and unpleasant Austrian climber. Another performance is fine. The story could have been fascinating, but somehow, it gets lost: one never really understands or cares about the characters that are shown, so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to attract this audience. <br /> <br /> The beautiful landscapes and the cinematography, a remarkably dramatic real story, important events that shaped the world we live in, but I could not, as much as I could, get involved in this story. As a fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the 5 best actors of his generation), I expected * to love * this movie - and yet it left me cold. <br /> <br /> It could be a failing within me, but I tend to point out the creative ending of this movie: direction, script writing, production, editing, somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully filmed: it should have been magnificent. It was probably worth seeing, just to get an idea, but do not expect too much, and maybe you're not as disappointed as I am. Above all, I was bored.
