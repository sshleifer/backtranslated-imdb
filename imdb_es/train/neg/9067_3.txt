Although I had some hopes for this film, particularly because I really enjoy the performance of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), I must say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and women too they are on that list). <br /> <br /> Yes, there was a couple of laughs out loud, although the movie could have been much better. The premise was not that scammers who cheat on their way to college meet their partner when they are discovered by someone with a proposal for them. The problem is that all the characters were so unpleasant, that I did not care about any of them. The blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was so psychopathic that it was not so fun to watch; I was not deranged in a particularly funny or charming way, I was just a crazy loser, which was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the movie was hard to follow: it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and often was not clear which was which. Only two or three of the gang scams were shown, you just had to believe they were really scammers, showing that their plans would have made a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was silly and badly written and directed at all times. I could continue talking about the deficiencies of the movie, but you understand the idea. It's not worth the $ 4 rent or the gas you need to drive to and from the movie store to rent!
