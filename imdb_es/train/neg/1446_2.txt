The film is an extra-long story from a classic novel that fails to capture the spirit of the original adventure. Pretty American Patrick Swayze is presented as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The movie continues throughout "Hollywood-ise" history changing the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The film manages to be predictable at all times, even for those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad fight sequences and very misinterpretation. <br /> <br /> In general, a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain.
