I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. This was a really horrible movie. The script, the direction and the acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could have made a smart and provocative film, but he did not. I twisted in my seat during the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the movie? Where was there something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was poorly done and a waste of my money. I do not see this movie.
