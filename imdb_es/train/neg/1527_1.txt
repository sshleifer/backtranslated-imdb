If you really want to lose two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Look at the TV listings. 2) Find the movie 'Men in white'. 3) When 'Men in White' comes on, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After spending two hours of bad word games, terrible (and not so funny) movie references, and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ​​ever made in recent history, you will have lost two hours of your life, and You will ask why. br /> <br /> Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this movie could be a good thing. It was not. <br /> <br /> But, on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you might find some familiar faces during the movie. Presumably to save on production costs, Saban (who also manufactures Power Rangers), decided to generously spray old monster costumes from everyone's favorite spawn toy franchise throughout the film. I saw some old monsters from the episodes I saw when I was a kid, so I guess at least it could be said to have some nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But, if you want to see the real power Rangers monsters, go see the Power Rangers themselves. It's much better than this piece of garbage. (And that's saying something!)
