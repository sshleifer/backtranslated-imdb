Two types of films that we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We should have liked a man named Sled; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this image is unpleasant, annoying and stupid from beginning to end. As there is no one in the story (good or bad) to warm up, there is no one to motivate the suspense necessary to keep the viewer interested. There is no camaraderie among the guys who try to steal the gold, and there is no camaraderie among those who try to protect it. Sledge has a beautiful friend, but there's no reason she's a slug or that she wants to be in the same room with this pig without an account. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful music, and from the very bad writing and direction of Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 old movies rented from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the bottom of the rock, the only real flaw in the group.
