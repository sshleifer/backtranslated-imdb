There's really no way to go around saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just sucks. Apart from the fact that the main character is a well-endowed blonde who runs around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional outbursts of graphic violence, the film seems to have taken on the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a line of figures from action. The same villain even speaks like an aspiring Skeletor, has the compulsory inept, and lives in a den that seems to have been inspired by the villain's dominance of the old Saturday morning caricature, Blackstar. Just do not expect any other humor other than the sometimes badly spoken dialogue. At other times, it feels like the kind of anime story best suited for hentai, but there is no sex, no tentacle violation (thank God!) And very little sexual appeal, this despite the character's physical appearance principal. There is simply no adult advantage in this material, unless you count half-naked heroin and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a long episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with more scant clothing and more gore.
