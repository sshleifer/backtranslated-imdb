This movie could have been a decent B movie if 3/4 of the film did not focus so much on the sex scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure there's a lot more going on with sex addicts than having sex on a regular basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what he had to do, which was not much. At one time or another, one would have to laugh at him, because his character was very unfortunate. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as a sex therapist in question, although she could have done more and I am not suggesting that she have sex. The person who most stood out in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and caring wife. There is something beautiful inside and out that attracts me a lot. She played that role and when you saw the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict" even if it is not Oscar material or a modern classic by all standards, it is quite informative and does a good job of showing you how personal demons can take control and ruin the things in life that you consider very important.
