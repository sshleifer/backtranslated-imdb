This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with several random explosions and then cuts a puppet of a T-Rex that speaks (!) To the audience. It goes from one side to another between the sock puppets and the animation throughout, probably because the filmmakers could not afford live actors. I will spare you the long, grueling and relentless plot that this unfortunate film drags for 85 brutal minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby shop somewhere that sells. he printed serial films and bought them for the sole purpose of making fun of him, but it turned out that our intervention was not necessary. This movie makes fun of itself better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from outer space" was the most interesting movie that existed, but leave it to Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock puppets to get over it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and it is worth many, many good laughs.
