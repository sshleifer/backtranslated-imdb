The previous part of the movie was quite nice, but towards the end it became trite. Although Turturro is an actor I generally like, his Luzhin often looked like a bad impression of Rain Man and the representation of the genius as a semi-man was annoying. In general, it seems that this film is struggling and ends up looking pompous despite its excellent performances.
