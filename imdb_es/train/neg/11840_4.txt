Everything that could potentially have been interesting in this material sank in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we are about to see can never be known and "This is the whisper [rumor] most often told" about one of the most sensational "mysteries" of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Agree. So we're not getting anything new (and E's "Mysteries and scandals" give you a better basis in the particular incident ... and that's not a big endorsement). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of snakes and decadents. There is no great news there. More interesting we learn what a chaotic director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and / or the political establishment. Raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. But what is said is so cynical and ugly and confusing, we feel guilty for having witnessed a handful of fools who pretend to be history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie has a curious crazy quality that I found more irritating than fun. We are not empathetic with anyone. And the great "Citizen Kane" polishes the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow" we are never sure of Davies's motives for being with Hearst. As soon as one thing is said, the other will be done. <br /> <br /> And should we believe that Davies was the love of the Chaplain's life? Or is he simply trying to bring down one of the most powerful and apparently moronic citizens in the United States? The movie never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> What is compelling are the production values. There is a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I took more advantage of the construction of some of the lapels on men's jackets than following a story that defames many of the best-known personalities in Hollywood history. Nobody will remember that the script is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it even more tentative and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the performers, although Meg Tilly overcomes the parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​landscapes chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much that it seems that she is distancing herself from the whole company instead of narrating it. One of its first lines is: "I'm not here!" And I'm sure I wish it were not. <br /> <br /> This is not on par with Bogdanovich's trash, so bad, it's good "At Long Last Love". It is about trying something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is full of bitterness towards "the beast" called Hollywood. This is the "National Enquirer" cinema. And it not only messes up the names of those that the film places on board the Oneida that weekend, but the audience also gets dirty.
