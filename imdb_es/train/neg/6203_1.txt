I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was horrible! All the fantasies of cliches, violent and rich were exhibited, you only knew how it was going to end, especially with all the photos of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was The questions and answers with the director / writer and writer / producer tried to interpret themselves as intellectuals, but you could say that they are the guys who throw themselves into violence. I bet everyone goes to brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to prevent my boyfriend from leaving there.
