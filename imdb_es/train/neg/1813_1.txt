If someone really wants to make a movie, REALLY bad, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a yardstick for measuring the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows throughout the world. main character ... Some poor imbeciles with a loose white "hairy" disguise that looks as if it's sewn from pieces of discarded carpets. Make your way slowly, painfully, through more not-so-special effects that completely deny the viewer the suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the fun of it). <br /> <br /> On second thought, skip this movie altogether and find something else to do for an hour and a half.
