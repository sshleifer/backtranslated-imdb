This departure of Naschy in 1974 is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a quick look at the advertising photos and packaging could lead him to believe that this medieval game is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG issue with domesticated torture sequences, without nudity and with little advantage. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) points his things as Gilles de Lancre, "former Marshal of the nation". Unfortunately, he is more of a pantomime villain than anything else. One has the feeling that with this movie we have seen (and did) everything before. Strictly therefore for Naschy complete only.
