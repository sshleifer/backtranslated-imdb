I did not like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried to see it again to see if my dislike for this movie was due to my movie tastes in the 80s or if it was "Stripes". It's just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in effect and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 80s, and may attract people who have undergone basic training. or who Bill Murray fans are, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Especially since "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy, but it's not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies like "Anchorman," who strives to laugh in every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" suffers even more from Bill Murray and Harold The lack of acting ability of Ramis. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very convincing dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are simply not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arc of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy in "Stripes" revolves around the self-centered and intelligent alec of Bill Murray. character man-child, so if you do not find that funny character (as I did not), you will not find most of the small comedy that is in "Stripes." <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is very much a movie of its time, it has not aged well and is not worth seeing. If you want to see a comedy of "friends" of the early 80's, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes", the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes", it has aged much better and, as a result, can still be seen.
