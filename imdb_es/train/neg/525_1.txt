I reviewed the other comments and had fun discovering that clearly only the people who really worked on the film had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and you want to comment on it, beat it a bit. "Innovative" is a little exaggerated. This is a college production based in Boston that does not even reach the level of most amateur college movies. It is what one would expect a lot of children to do. A silly action movie without much creativity. It's very funny if you're willing to make fun of it. It's not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson University.
