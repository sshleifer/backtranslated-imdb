This called remake is terrible. I went to see this tonight ... the first day, since anticipation and exaggeration were too much for me. But within the first half hour, we knew that this is a disaster. Not only does it not match the created drum, it also insults the original box office success. The script had loopholes, the editing was messy several times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine ... the director wanted to portray how evil his character is, but he went a little overboard, which led him to be forceful. Ajay, who is especially gentle in these types of roles, was also a disappointment. Do not even start with the new Prashant boy ... one would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav, who was involved in some laughter, could not even make anyone smile because of his energetic humor and high-pitched voice. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. In general, RGV, which I thought was one of the most gifted and talented directors in India ... has failed miserably. He took on such a big challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie and made it a disaster.
