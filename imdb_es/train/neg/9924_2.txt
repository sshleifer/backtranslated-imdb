"Dutch Schultz", also known as Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather unpleasant life is pretty well documented. This movie that pretends to represent your life should have used a fictional character, because too dramatized events are a too strong deviation from the facts and the chronology. Not only that, but it also ignores some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the public relations fiasco in the state of New York and its religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. Alabama. But that is all that goes. The scene of the explosive plaque depicting Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home, assisted by his own mother, is ridiculous. In addition, there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond. It just does not work The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer does not work either. This film does not need a loving Jewish mother for comic relief. The poor representation of Legs Diamond was quite humorous. I am sure that man is becoming his grave. And, by the way, Dutch actually killed people personally, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene where he erases the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just did not understand it.
