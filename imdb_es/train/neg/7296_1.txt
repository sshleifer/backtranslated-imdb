Columbo movies have gone downhill for years, this year may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same performance without inspiration and appears as creepy in this movie. As usual in this series, the protocols of the crime scene are unknown, so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and takes pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a rather unconvincing lady man. (His fainting, however, was a hoot!) The script was for the numbers and his condescending delivery. They should never have taken Columbo to the nineties, they just left us all with one or two happy memories of intelligent plots, better scripts and clear characterizations.
