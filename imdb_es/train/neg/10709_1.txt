I can not think of much to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to watch it. He had so few redeeming qualities that I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot went from the implausible to the absolutely absurd. My whole body was tense for the duration of the movie because I could not wait for it to end and end the horrible thing. At the end of the movie, I found myself feeling more than relieved. <br /> <br /> The edition was poor, the performance was below average and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was chosen as a Native American, although she does not even look much like someone of Native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be such an idiot, at the very least it should be ridiculously stupid. It was not It was just pathetic.
