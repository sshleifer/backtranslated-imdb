This film is a flagrant scam of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner, by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film shown in IMDb give recognition to the original author, but I did. I do not see this at the beginning of the film, only a merit at the end saying "suggested by the book Silas Marner". He suggested? It was nothing more than a complete scam of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> An abused and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has stolen all his money. One night, a child approaches his door while his mother lies dead in the snow outside. The man welcomes her and brings her until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. It is he who fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. Then, the battle is fought over who should have legal custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this and all other aspects of the film, the story is exactly the same. In one I can find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy, but maybe that would have forced Mr. Martin's acting abilities too much. In addition to that, he has dyed his hair with a mixture of carrot juice (probably to make him look younger, but actually to make him look more like the clown he is). They also add meaningless jokes, which this unconventional comedian can not resist introducing into history that has no part in it and that only detracts from the depth of the story. Like when the girl cries in court declaring that she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. The girl transmits the nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her cry! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the legality and integrity of the film industry allow this film to be made. If he were a trustee of George Eliot, he would insist on reparation. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the proceeds to that property, or to the poor. At a minimum, Silas Marner, adapted by S. Martin, should be titled. Or better yet, take it out of the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story, and I hope you are, download it completely and look at Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980s.
