You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. You believe that He is the Son of God or He does not. The choice is up to you. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand has really done everything possible to return Jesus to a mere historical figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the Son of the Holy God. Spirit and Mary, who reopened heaven for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, a world comes from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film shows a theologian who brings some "modern findings" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Game of the Passion, who happily incorporates them into his game. Made in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the Passion Play players instead of showing her love for God through celibacy. Most of the time, the abhorrence of the director of the Church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The director has tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion Play actor. This is an admirable attempt, but to represent the Resurrection with the transplant of the organs of the actor Passion Play in other bodies means how the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, the opinion of God is, but I would not want to stand in the shoes of the director and the actors when standing before the throne of Jesus.
