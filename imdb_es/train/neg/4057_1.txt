This is an extremely boring movie. If you grew up during the Vietnam era, as I did, then you have already seen and heard all the images and arguments of the film here hundreds of times. But what really makes this film boring is the narration of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film was filmed with Sherwood speaking directly to the camera about his opinion about this conflictive moment in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you will win 'I do not find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film, Going Upriver. Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be an ax job on John Kerry, but he fails miserably at achieving that goal.
