This documentary is a recreation of the last years of the career of Betty Page (Paige Richards). The mockery of Tennessee was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and it was fetish photos, bondage and cat fights. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous pictures or "deer movies", but nevertheless, Klaw was accused of distributing obscene materials and ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. No wonder Betty has had a cult at the height of her career. The girl next door with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figure with or without fetish attire would be fascinated for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie could actually have been much better; but good enough to maintain interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is amazing in her own right. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not damage your image in the slightest. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Keep in mind that this movie can change your heart rate.
