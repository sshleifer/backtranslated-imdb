My husband and I are the parents of an autistic child who lives in the same municipality as the scriptwriter of this film. We were very upset because the JCC is taking this film to their Jewish film festival because of the way the mentally disabled character Frankie is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We demand the money back. We encourage the scriptwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the Achad program of JCC to apologize. <br /> <br /> We did not like seeing Frankie, a teenager with mental disabilities and perhaps even autistic, as part of a joke. what keeps dropping something to look at the babysitter's breasts. <br /> <br /> It did not make any sense to Frankie's character more than saying "hey, having a mental disability is funny". Challenges like Frankie's are a serious matter. Families like mine are really suffering. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter needs to explain herself. Do you know families with disabled children? Do you see families with disabled children week after week in the JCC pool?
