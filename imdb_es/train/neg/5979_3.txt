Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the television series, united without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokémon (conflict, fight and a resolution where everyone is happy at the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled (in the final credits!) Without explanation, and everything is a bit too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why watch it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. My two children enjoy Pokémon, and by showing my interest in what they like, we are closer. Watching a movie in a theater is still different from seeing it in the subway, and my children enjoy the experience of going to the movies. I gave the film a 4, mainly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
