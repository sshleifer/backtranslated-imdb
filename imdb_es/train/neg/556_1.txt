In my book "Basic Instinct" it was a perfect movie. He had an outstanding performance in the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the smallest role. I had wonderful pictures, music and the blackest script of all time. All this adds up to a movie that is as good as we'll ever get! <br /> <br /> This sequel is exactly the opposite, it can not get worse, a bad performance and a lame script, combined with a totally inept Direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somehow keeps it concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact and original copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible disaster are the excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the enthusiast responsible for the script even included the dialogue "You can not smoke in this room" in the interrogation scene and yes, she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this horrible movie that should never have been done! It harms the original, so bad it is. The only redeeming value is realizing that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Ms. Stone got the best surgeon that money can buy) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also applies to the making of films. There should be a law: Never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
