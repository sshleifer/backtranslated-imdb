This is an amateur movie recorded on video, not an "electrifying drama", as the notes on the DVD cover falsely boast. I've seen much better things from undergraduate film students. Most of the story takes place with a taxi ride all night around Jakarta. This movie could have been made with just one video camera, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content was joined later. The edition is extremely rough. The final edition was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content from one side to another, instead of using an appropriate editor. Maybe they did the issue in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone who did not speak English fluently, for example, "Where are you going now?" To say that production quality is on par with Blair Witch is generous. If you have not yet been scared, this film was an ambitious and creative task, with many great and funny images of all of Jakarta.
