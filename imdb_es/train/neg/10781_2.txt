In fact, it never was. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940 comedy. What a vacuous mess! None of these people approaches Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, today's audience is not as receptive to this easy move. The writing is trivial. The trite plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the main characters does not exist. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she is a reincarnation of a great star of the "golden age of Hollywood", whenever that is. It is an effect that tries and fails once again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
