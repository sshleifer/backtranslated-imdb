This is a stinky classic with a cast with a big name, mostly older adults who passed their heyday and bedtime in this. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty depressing movie when you think about it. Stay on earth, and you will face illness and, finally, your death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. Pity that the film did not concentrate more on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking emaciated, still showed the steps of "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom", much more realistic than it was 10 years before. <br /> <br /> I just hope that this movie does not encourage older adults to commit mass suicide at Jim Jones level. How can someone be stupid enough to like this and say it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the seniors were doing that Something wonderful in the end, why was the young man encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also jump off the ship? After all, he had found his beloved. <br /> <br /> This would have been a good movie if the elderly had been able to find their source of youth on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, In this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Lord know who else has left. The writers should have taken the script and placed it in this group as well.
