Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has his mind corroded by his work along with memories of an abusive education at the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals in madness and, finally, a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald man) fight for the control of their soul. This movie is undone by some bad performances and involuntary humorous scenes. I do not mean it's horrible or something, just that you can say it's as well-known as it is to the rabid fan base of Bruce Campbell (of which I am one) who will probably see anything he is or is involved in some way . <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Comment with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second comment by Kallio and sound designer Joel Newport; 'Hate every minute' a 17-minute documentary; Scenes deleted and extended; alternate take Outtakes, world premiere images; Poster and fixed gallery; Biographies of talent; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom: Script in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: highlight your eyes for a laugh (left eye) and a minute of nothing more than a real easter egg (right eye)
