I basically went through the movie, but enough to see the plot. To tell you the truth, it was boring for me and in some points it did not make sense. The only reason I saw this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was a bit weird. But it's still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite how good CHACE is, it did not really make up for the movie. I guess the plot is not that bad, but what really made me doubt was the fact that they are as bad as every sentence. Is it so hard to express your anger without saying the word F every time? The curse was annoying and all the flashy, the tremor of the camera gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> In general, although the plot was fine, I thought the film was boring and more dramatic. That's why I only do scenes with CHACE. LOL Anyway, it's not worth it to rent unless you're a fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yes, the cast was hot. The girls were HOT !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST !!
