Okay, I LOVE this movie ... I'm going to give credit to this movie, alone, for making me such a fan of horror. I could never watch this movie alone. I've also heard many stories of the effect it had on its original release in theaters, on its viewers. Amazing masterpiece ... Horrible and psychological things scare me a lot. Oh, bless your hearts, who made this amazing movie. I love. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is VERY terrifying, it's the most terrifying movie I've ever seen! It's not that what happens in the movie and the idea of ​​the film are not terrifying enough, but what always surprised me was Brendan's fabulous performance. The best horror movie in history. Nothing can be that scary again. Halloween watching at its most evil point.
