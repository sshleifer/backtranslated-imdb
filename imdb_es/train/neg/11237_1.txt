I went to see this movie with few expectations, but with the hope of being delighted to see my hometown in a movie. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story covers a familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is complicated and the supernatural element adds little to this worn-out theme. Although the quality of the acting was generally good, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was shameless: women are apparently not satisfied unless they are married, procreating or both (although this was expressed as a post-feminist option). Even worse was racism, the jealous and shrill mother, the black man who still lives at home, and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting class geeks). We should be ashamed if we think that these characters represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should feel ashamed for having brought to the screen those stereotypes so broad and cruel.
