I remember when this was in theaters, the reviews said it was horrible. Well, I did not think it was that bad. It was fun and had a lot of ironic humor about the families who were close to the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and makes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the scene of lawyers where they sign a contract. That was fun. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he makes silly requests to the family and even writes scripts to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter because of the love interest. And learn that vacations are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole doo-dah act was fun, especially when they replaced the first with a black man, and the parents of the brides did not. Do not even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting his "supposed daughter". FINAL VERDICT: I thought it worthwhile to have a look if you catch it by cable.
