While I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always felt personally that Martin Scorsese is a bit overrated in his abilities. His use of striking stylistics in a number of his films seems to scream "Look at me, am I not an imaginative director?" His best film that I have seen is the one that less blooms, the superlative "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this new version, it seems that it was a business as usual. The boring film material to convey a scenario from the 1950s was so insipid as to be a distraction in itself. It is more likely that the melodramatic approaches combined with the partial imitation of the classical score "Psycho" provoke smiles of mockery than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score of "Psycho" was brilliantly disconcerting, this "tribute" only sounds strident and annoying. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, offers histrionic performances that only shout "caricature"; The notable exception to this fact is an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst delinquent acting here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, it seems adequately threatening, but as soon as he opens his mouth, the aura simply drains away. Now I'm not an expert on American accents, at first I come from Manchester, near Manchester, but is it likely that I found a Southern accent more convincing than that? Being the talented physical actor that he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting for me, as a fan of De Niro, to wish he was off the screen, instead of regretting his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) <br /> <br /> The over-the top style of the whole movie stretches to the ridiculously exaggerated end. When will Scorsese learn that underestimating the situation can sometimes generate tension as effectively as a visual and sound bombardment for the viewer? I also thought that it was a reputation too respected to resort to the cheap trick 'undead killer' that less talented individuals could use. <br /> <br /> In general, a completely ridiculous "thriller". . Scorsese and De Niro have done much better working together.
