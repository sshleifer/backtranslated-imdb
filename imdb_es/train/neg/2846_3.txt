What a terrible movie this is. The only reason I would want to sit through this mess is the pleasing sight of Miss Eleniak. The painful overexploitation of Mr. McNamara, who sometimes became shameful, ruined what could have been a reasonable movie if the right actors had been chosen. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to be.
