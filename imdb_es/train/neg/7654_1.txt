I remember reading all the horrible and horrible reviews of this movie when it came out. I wanted to go see how horrible it was, but I was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how horrible it was. I could not think of the horrible attention that this movie was receiving was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that this movie is not exempt from some great shots. There is a good shot at the beginning that shows a bullet fired from inside the gun, which I thought was clean. And the way the monsters die in this movie is a great thing to see; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst of this movie: Tara Reid. If the bad performance was a sin, hell would have thrown Tara Reid away immediately, since it is incredibly horrible in this movie, it is unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now, if she played a silly sex toy with an empty head, then maybe she could forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize that, although he seemed to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just did not realize that getting her to do that in the middle of the movie at the absolutely wrong time made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humiliation? I could not say <br /> <br /> What brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst leadership skills you'll see in a movie. I mean, I would give an F to House of the Dead (and I only do it for very few movies) but HotD would get at least a B compared to this piece of garbage fucked up. The film begins with a very, very long narrative that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrator) and, from there, the cuts are really, really stupid. There is a point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that has been destroyed and the screen goes dark. When he returns, Slater and Reid are firing everywhere and, suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Eh <br /> <br /> And someone did NOT bother to check the errors in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings change color in the middle of a scene and after Slater moves away from a dead partner, you can watch her begin to get up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about an ancient tribe that releases the darkness and someone "opens the way" or something and all the evil monsters appear. It's just an excuse to have many gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character needs to reload in this film) that they get bored, simply. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie with the hope of laughing at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
