The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is the idea that if you become a saint, he or she and your family and your partner live forever. Let's forget that to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and the saints have no other significant ones. That, for a millennium, Nick has never been the Jolly Elf of Fred's Scrooge. Open Nick learning how to make toys, then Fred learning how to make numbers; Nick gives a sick child a wheelbarrow, Fred returns to win the doll, along with the family farm! After a few more episodes, he transforms into the current Fred who unburdens his spleen in Siblings Anonymous while his fellow losers nod in empathy. There, I just wrote a more coherent story than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic worm loaded with The Queen of Harpies, an operation that came out of Mega -Mall Hell and responds to a Board (huh?) That just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg. Oh, and her right hand is an elegant blonde with a tight minidress and Go-Go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me to the limit was that Slam was named # 1 on the naughty list. Should not a Naughty List be reserved for future Hitlers and Stalins? Children who are the true incarnations of evil? No, Old Sausage-Fingers, a good guy who lashes out because he's not wanted and not loved is the Demon Seed! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus must be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
