I ended up watching this movie before going through any of the reviews, at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know if there are people who really recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite surprised to find such long and positive comments on this website that they make me conclude that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I have to ask: "Are these filmmakers delayed or not? Do they assume that viewers are retarded?" The movie is atrocious on many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> So, this group of boys plus a girl (the main actress) form a band; Guessing by the constant presence of guitars, it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers start being part of a rock band? Anyway, let me accept it as the Bollywood version of the rock band, but in a very funny way all the scores that made these two guitarists do all kinds of "ROCK GESTURES" and I assume they were playing the instruments, the sound of the guitar was missing completely !!! I just can not understand the magnitude of the stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I'm just going to conclude here because it's not worth pointing out any other flaws in the movie. The directors of Bollywood seem to have no shame anymore !!!!!!!!
