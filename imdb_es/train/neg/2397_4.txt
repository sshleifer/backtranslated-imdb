Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller, "DO NOT LOOK", right? Strangely, the aforementioned film was aired on BBC television over the weekend, which did no favor to the COLD HEAVEN screening tonight. <br /> <br /> You see that it is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DO NOT LOOK NOW, since both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN, I thought that they also had the Same plot, except that a dead husband had been replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was focused on this film that revolved around a widow distressed by the pain of seeing her late husband running through Venice with a red anorak. This does not happen, but approximately one third of the execution time, there is a massive turn of the plot and, despite being an essential turn of the plot, it is not explained with great depth. In fact, very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN, which ruins the film <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the rather low production values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If it had not been different, I would have thought it was a TVM, since it has been made for television up to the white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject the pretensions of the house of art through spoken thought processes, but again this does not help the film at all. One can not help feeling that Roeg should have put all his effort into the twists of the plot that are totally flat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, selfless direction and a really strange premise and script for a bad movie
