"Drama" hilariously obvious about a group of high school kids (I think) who enjoy hip-hop without interruption, break dance, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at Roxy, or something like that. To be totally honest I was so bored that I forgot it! Even people who love music agree that this movie is horribly played and, like a drama, failed miserably. We are supposed to find these children nice and nice. I found them dull and boring. The one he really hated was Ram√≥n. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is considered great. Excuse me? You are altering the public property that is not yours to begin with. In addition, these "big" children take advantage of the electricity of the city to celebrate a great dance party in an abandoned building. UH Huh. So we're supposed to find a group of kind and funny law addicts. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can not stand hip hop. The songs were, at best, mediocre and non-stop! They are ALWAYS playing! I got to the point that I was rapidly advancing through the numerous numbers of endless music. (Cut the music and you'll have a 30-minute movie, maybe) There are some imaginative numbers: the subway dance fight, a really fun Santa number and Roxy's climate show. If you like hip hop here is your movie. But if you're looking for a good mixed drama, forget it. Also, how did this get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of swearing in this.
