I was looking for a cute and simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie turned out to be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write anything good about that. First, the script is stupid and nothing funny, and is based on tired and recycled jokes and a turtle that farts a laugh. In my book, that's not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> 'Effects' of low budget (if I can call them effects) with a horrible cinematography. In many places it feels almost like an independent film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate to get some money for agreeing to participate in this? (Looking at his recent filmography, it would seem that yes). Despite the costumes, Pamela is showing her age and, in general, they do not even show up so sexy, let alone fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even in the category of what is so bad that it is fun. It's just bad, as if everyone involved was fed up with it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
