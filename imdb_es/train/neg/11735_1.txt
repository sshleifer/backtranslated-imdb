This movie angered me a lot because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do not have a Southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who makes methamphetamines and I do not know the real plot or what the movie is supposed to be about. It has a fairly graphic drug use and is really insulting, so watch these people use methamphetamine as if it were sugar. I lost my brother to the use of methamphetamines and this movie makes my stomach sick because it makes the drug more glamorous. The film makes the use of the drug look good, but I felt happy at the end when the boy almost managed to cross the state line. I also know that most women who suffer a traumatic rape do not want to make love with their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs.
