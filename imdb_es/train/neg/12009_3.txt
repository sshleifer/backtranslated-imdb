I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to see the whole movie without falling asleep. It moves slowly, and the idea of ​​a platform in the middle of the Atlantic, which may have been revolutionary at that time, is now a great big yawn. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable, and it's only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. When the water began to spill in a big way, even, on one occasion, it woke me up. <br /> <br /> But give the man what he deserves. Nobody could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. Do not put it between your index and middle fingers like minor mortals. He holds it between his fingers, while showing us the old pearly browns. There are some scenes in this film where the smoke moves towards the sky on a dark background, and it seems very artistic. But it does not say much about this movie if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke.
