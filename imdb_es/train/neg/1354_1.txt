I saw your movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know one or two things about movies. And Crispin Glover's movie is outrageous. It basically exploits the mentally disabled. Shirly Temple is not only the antichrist (which I admit is a little funny) telling the mental challenger to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who is like all of them, with mental problems. PETA and human rights should be for all this. It is not a "counterculture" as Crispin declared at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it is an exploitation.
