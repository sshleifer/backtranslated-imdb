I saw the trailer of the movie several times in the theater and I got excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like those made in the 90s. It also reminded me of Fugitive movies, a chase of cats and mice between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most insipid action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a television movie. Not quite. First of all, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, television movies can be very funny at times, but this movie is the exact opposite of having fun. It does not have a visual style, and the most important thing is that the tone of the film is not attractive. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes that consist of a chase and a crash. Also, they are not great action scenes, but the worst part is that those action scenes are very insipid like the whole movie. The love story between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. Also, the president's assassination plot is the most clich√© story in this genre, but insist on that. And this is not a cat and mouse movie as it is supposed to be. Although, Douglas is very old now, he still has the potential to act in an action thriller. In the movie, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice, since you feel like you're watching Jack Bauer and, somehow, his character is one of the reasons that make the movie like a television movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, for Of course she is too passive or Directly in this movie, because she is a soap opera actress. The movie was not funny for a second for me, so I could not get over it for a while.
