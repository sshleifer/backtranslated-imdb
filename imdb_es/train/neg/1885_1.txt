If you are looking for a movie, portray the meaningless and boring existence of middle class lives trapped in a network of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you are also interested in the film to get involved and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do this much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darker movies. The filmmaker felt that, to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should subject the viewer to one dying and empty incident after another until the film finally reaches its tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.
