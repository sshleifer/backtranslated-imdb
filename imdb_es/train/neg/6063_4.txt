"Masters of Horror" has proven to be a poor scenario for "episodes of messages," and while a definitive case can be made for Joe Dante's "Flying Fly Solution" (one of the best episodes in the series, ), most efforts to do so have been found as heavy and unimpressive (nothing deactivates more horror than a box of soap). And 'Pro-Life' simply fuses reactionary views with ultra-violence; The young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), who is seen running through the woods, is almost beaten by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who simply drive to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a sacred right-wing roller who will do everything possible to prevent his daughter from aborting. If it were not for something else, 'Pro-Life' accumulated a stir for its controversial problem, but John Carpenter treats this whole adventure with surprising indifference: he seems even less interested in making a film than in the script itself (which is certainly poor) ; the slow pace does not generate tension, and simply causes the already itinerant plot to drag. Even when Dwayne and his children break into the clinic, with their guns on, it's an incredible event; Later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion', the scene appears as gratuitous and unnecessary, an effort to fill in the subscribed film. The bad performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become a consequence of the script, and Carpenter's management feels exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' were the source of their next hot meal. For when a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are hanging around the halls, you just have to wonder what the minds were thinking about this mess ...
