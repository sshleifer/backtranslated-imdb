He needed an excuse to leave the house while the paint was dry: he left the film after an hour to return and see how the paint dries. <br /> <br /> I do not remember leaving a movie before, but I really try to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just kept going wrong. Let's go! Uma Thurman doing these things? Special effects quite loose. These were older characters and actors who lived a superficial and horny life in their twenties, just a kind of annoying and wrong feeling. <br /> <br /> This review is based only on the first hour; I could have improved. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried in a darker shade than when it was lit.
