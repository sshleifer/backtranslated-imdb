This movie could have been much better, especially considering the talent. The performance of Larenz Tate by Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. She does not synchronize her lips well and her theatrical gestures are Larenz Tate, when it should have been Frankie Lymon. The representation of women as a group of gold prospectors has Hollywood written everywhere. The powers that obviously drove him, but only made the characters more unreal. The positive aspects of the film were the interpretation of Miguel Núñez by Little Richard, and the cameo by Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is very attractive, as always, even in a conservative role. It is a pity that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox have been wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasted opportunity.
