I love Dracula, but this movie was a total disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies when I was younger, and I thought it was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if it was my youth that deceived me into believing that Lee was the best Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction and evil below that. Or maybe it was only this movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But, can you imagine Dracula with an English snobbery and the body language that goes with it? Do you like it when a plot contains unrealistic options on the part of the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not see it! I only gave him a 2 because somehow I managed to stay awake throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you liked this movie, then you must have been sleep deprived and alone at home in a dark room with a lot of unguarded space behind you. Maybe only at your parents 'house or at strangers' house. Because even the characters in this movie did not seem scared, and I think that sums it up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in the history of Dracula's cinema, perhaps fascinated by how The History of Dracula has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because as a film it is not so attractive, it does not lead you to the suggestive mystery that, for me, makes the myth of the vampire so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And, besides, it has so much of what the 70-year-olds have to do with it. The stage looks like a cheap theater. And I do not say rejecting everything that was done in the 70s. Because I can love both the old and the new films.
