If there is a movie that is the worst of this year, it is TASHAN. The first promotion gave an indication that the movie will be a boring Dhoom 2 movie, and well, first I knew it would just be a bad movie. being a Yashraj movie Or maybe watching the corny promo But this movie shocked me, it was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what I expected The introduction of First Saif, which is boring Then, Saif-Kareena is found, Kareena is very artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what are you doing in such a weird movie? What kind of paper is it? What action is he doing? His first scene is fine, but then his act becomes repetitive and overreacts. Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes, but then the movie got more boring and with all the old stuff. Childish romance, overdose of action scenes in the childlike Rajnikant style and all the boring scenes. The ending is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have 3 more films to direct, if this movie would have worked, that's the yashraj strategy, just money nothing else. Vijay is another addition to his list of Crap filmmakers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is normal <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar is presented in the film as a breath of fresh air, actually providing some interesting moments. Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad. scandalously and spoils the show even more Rest is fine
