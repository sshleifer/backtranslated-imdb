Millie is a sap. He marries a rich man named Maitland and they have a son. Then he catches him cheating and divorces him ... but allows him to stay with the child he says he loves. Back then, in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to high marital support and to her children, but it leaves the guy incredibly easy ... without support ... what nonsense! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he also turns out to be a cheat! Wow, do you have a hard time choosing men? <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a party girl, doing everything possible to distract herself from her bad luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter whom she left early in the film is now 17 years old and, strangely, the fashions have not changed a bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) Now pretends to be the friend of the daughter, but he has lustful designs on her. Millie promises that if he touches the girl, she will kill him. Make a wild guess what happens next! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a confusing and often strange mess, a bit like "Madam X" but much, much less focused. Very often, Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And, the movie seems to have a little bit of everything thrown into it, as long as it justifies the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good.
