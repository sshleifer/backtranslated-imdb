All the films of the thirties have a date, but if you only saw John Ford's films, it would seem more dated than if you had seen others. that is, the Grand Hotel is a comparatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always the hard sale of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the excessive emphasis of the wickedness of some heavy. Always the badly elaborated, awkward and obvious scripts. This is not an exception. It's just a pretty elaborate device to convey feelings. And feeling is all this has to do. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not make me thank Lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the states were ever resolved by the population of complete idiots described here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too old-fashioned to be anything but bad. It feels completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is strange. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the following 'S', or say "Shonuff!"
