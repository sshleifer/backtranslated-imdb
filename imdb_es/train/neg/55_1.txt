There are only two movies that I would give a 1/10, this stinky and "The man who fell to Earth." I remember seeing Protocol in a theater in the early 80's when I was in high school. The script is an insult to the intelligence of anyone (including a high school student). I lost completely with the "hilarious" gag of someone who was shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but she is insipid and silly. Then there are the offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie who beats everyone by spitting the populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not bear to see another film I was in until, in the IMO, redeemed itself in All say that I love you. This is the kind of movie you do if you do not want to make an effort to write scripts. Worst.
