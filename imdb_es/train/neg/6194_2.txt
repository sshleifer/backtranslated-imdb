With a title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and liberal support from Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a bit above the usual kind of garbage that our British cinema produces. "Robert Carmichael" (for short) is presented as a realistic study of juvenile alienation and at the same time seems a critique of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so unrealistic and atypical, unlike the stinking imaginations of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not rapists addicted to drugs. As a critic of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (performed by a talented classical musician - subtext society has harmed this sensitive individual) is so childish that you can hardly think. There are indications of technical capacity, but some reviewers have exaggerated it. Like Kubrick and Noe, it shows that the desire to impact with a supposedly serious intention may be the worst cinematic trick of a recent movie. People liked "The mechanical orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked rape and violence, but above all they liked to feel culturally superior for liking the things they hated the most. Too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) labels it here as one of the most moronic films in years. (I'm not against the violence in the film, but doing it seriously is a tricky trick.) People in theaters applauded Alex in "The Clockwork Orange," which shows how Kubrick's supposed intention was lost for many. kilometers Free violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many film and art directors.)
