15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially the youth. When I was a 3-year-old boy living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday at ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the film premiered in 1995, I was very surprised when I saw it with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the Rangers plush toys). I even played video games and I just loved one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was very sad. Anyway, it was the program that set a step in my interest for the series of robots (especially the anime series mech as "Gundam"). Now that I am 18 years old, I would like to think that this program seems pretty corny. To prove this, I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and I saw them both. I was like, "Ugh, how horrible, just another trash in the attic for me." For all of you, people of my generation, this is NOT a show that I would like to see again and again. I'm not saying you leave it for the rest of your life, but once in a while it's not a bad thing, right? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (also known as Ninja Robots), or even the original Sentai shows that were the basis of the "Power Rangers".
