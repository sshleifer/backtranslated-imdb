Seeing this last night, I was surprised that Fox spent so much money on that and recovered his investment so little. It's the kind of disaster you have to see to believe it. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the first morning of the filming of Raquel Welch dusted the fireplace rack to prepare a place for the Academy Award that I would surely win for this daringly original film. Ups. That is not what happened. <br /> <br /> The internal fight on the set was printed by Rex Reed and this helped the film reach a reputation before it was released. When it was finally released, there was not the usual circus of three advertising rings. If I remember correctly, in Houston it opened its doors in the drive-ins and neighborhood theaters and never played in any of the great places. <br /> <br /> I assume most of the blame to the director Michael Sarne, who was very satisfied after having directed (not all that is good) JOANNA, a movie with music about young people in the swing of London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox ended up firing him and putting the film together as best they could. That is why the scenes are played without a particular sequence and the characters appear and then disappear. An impressive cast of support (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend it to the length of the show, there are numerous Fox movie clips with stars like Carmen Miranda (with amazing images of THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who never dreamed they would be playing in a film rated for X. <br /> <br /> The X rating is due to an occasional language of numerous sexual perversions; However, none of the characters seems to be having fun. Maybe someone involved with the film had a distorted puritan sensibility and thought that if they could make these things unattractive, it was not bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the "juvenile" photos that almost went bankrupt. Hollywood in the 1970s. One writer jokingly said that EASY RIDER (which was made for the pocket change) was the most expensive film ever made, because they followed many films that tried and failed in the worst way to double their success. Sixtyish, once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, made films like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience. White directors and writers tried to make films to attract a black audience. Those films are locked somewhere in a vault, and the two that bear his name and many others of that genre have never come out, as far as I know, to video or cable at home. They are the dark secret of studies. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance on this is, in general, very good. With the right direction and script, she was able to play the kind of blatantly liberated women in which Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized. It looks great and has incredible costumes. Mae West is the seventy-something-lively actress I've seen in my life. On the one hand, it's a bit heartbreaking to see his attempt to capture his glory from years gone by, but I'm sure he needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget with X rating The movie of this time takes a look at BEYOND THE VALLE DE LAS MUÃ‘ECAS (also from Fox) because it is not taken seriously. It's crazy kids playing with the team in an important studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. There simply was not anyone who wanted to listen.
