This movie is very important because I suggested this consideration: sometimes you may wish to be sick ... sometimes you may wish to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may wish to have Goldfield's syndrome ... just like you. I do not remember this boring movie ... and above all I would not remember Adam "superfluous" Sandler ... sometimes, simply, he may wish ... to have rented another movie ... <br /> <br /> My vote ? 3 of 10. My suggestion? If you're not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke, there is no Adam Sandler fan ... I want to have hope), save yourself ... Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
