I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so I do not need to say that I bought this movie without even renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible, I did not even take it to the store, I would not want anybody. To be subjected to this human poison, I threw it away, no matter the money, it was worth the price to throw it away. The performance was not so bad, it was not good or anything. The story was horrible, and the ending was something I despise. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. His life was a lot of garbage. I thought that his horse, the peanut, was a horrible device to prove the innocence of his childhood, a dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this ending certainly upset me. Jesus heals everything ... I hate that he knows people like this who are great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not cure everything, or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the option to see it, approve it or, better yet, buy it or rent it, throw it away and leave the coffee in it in the morning
