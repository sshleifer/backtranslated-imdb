When I discovered that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I felt like scoring. I admit, I was eager to see the movie. And I have to say that the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in some way. Then it went all downhill. I did not expect him to be a mumbo jumbo politically correct civil rights dump. They took all possible controversial topics and threw it into a stupid story. I was horrified that Noah was involved in something like that, especially in his role. Nobody with a fully functional brain would really accept all that shit about the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know what communism was like, sit down and read a book about it. And not one that praises or is against, only the hard and cold data. <br /> <br /> I only saw some scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. . Everything else about this movie irritated me.
