A long-awaited movie ... But it disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the film on the first day .. From the trailers it looked like an action movie, but it turned out to be a comedy to go out and out (a bad comedy ). But one thing that deserves to be appreciated is the performance of these professional actors, who have done their part of the film very well. Good acting, but I do not think I can save the movie ... India has been filmed to perfection. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) They were all saturated with color, good. However, the way the intrinsic beauty of these places soared made me want to know exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> The action sequences were recorded very poorly No one could do. Outside the head and tail of the stunts, they used Akki (Akshay Kumar) very well, but it could have done much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst thing I've seen in recent movies (90s movies had better animated scenes, I guess (the initial scene where the car is falling is' flying should be better word 'way to the lake'. <br /> <br /> And the name of the films is mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure that the public does not forget the name of the film, I guess ...
