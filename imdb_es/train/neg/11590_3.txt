It's getting worse, the series is in a serious crash. The first two sequels were acceptable and since then we have seen a lot of really terrible movies. Robert Englund offers another great performance as Freddy, but the rest of the cast can not act. The story is that Alice, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, finds that Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams begin once again. This time, the mocking assassin is pounding through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? Take a look at the first three, miss the next three and then look at the last one.
