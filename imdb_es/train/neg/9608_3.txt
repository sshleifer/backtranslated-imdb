['Man, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And most importantly, where can I get some? The initial scene sets the tone of the film: a woman who twists naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. And this is not a transformation of Rick Baker &#39;American werewolf&#39;, friends. We are talking about the worst makeup ever filmed here. I can only imagine a little glue scattered Italian in nude Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagonist of the movie (is it a word?)), And ask him to roll up. That is how bad it is. <br /><br /> From now on, there is nothing better. Minutes are wasted while the stage that the male actors chew talks about Daniela and her state or something (I can not remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you do not laugh at that, you will cry). <br /><br /> The funny thing is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psychopath who goes crazy when there is a man nearby (it is understandable, since she was raped as a child), so she thinks he becomes a werewolf like his ancestor (the initial scene). She can not help tearing the throat of every man she knows, and she just wants to be loved! Things start to improve for Daniela when she meets and falls in love with an amateur amateur who does not trigger her &quot;episodes&quot;. Check out the montage here, one of the tastiest you&#39;ve ever seen (laugh and hug after diving headfirst through a window). <br /><br /> The luck of Daniela does not last when the film takes a brutal turn, suddenly it is brutally beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the double. Reminiscent of &quot;I spit on your grave&quot;, Daniela draws bloody vengeance on her rapists. <br /><br /> These are the 100 minutes of my life that I will never return. But hey, that&#39;s the game you play when you&#39;re a geek in the movie.']
