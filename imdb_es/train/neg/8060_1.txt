What a bad, bad movie! I tried to look without overtaking ... That failed. After about 30 minutes, I stopped the movie and went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, how wrong!) It was a confusing and boring movie. I do not think anyone can be brought down by being hit with a fluorescent bulb, much less destroyed by one! The only funny thing is that I saw the "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box boldly says "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical premiere!" Oh! If this movie was horrible with all those claims, I wonder how scarce was the "UN-Killer cut". If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, look at any of the series of Night of the Living Dead!
