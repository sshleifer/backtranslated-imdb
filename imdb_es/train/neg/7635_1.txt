I totally agree with a review by a Variety critic that the film is never as funny, animated or insightful about the creative process as its premise seems to justify. Narratively it is messy and lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be directed by the characters, poor lighting does not improve the performance and, sometimes, it is difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty following the English spoken in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Film Festival last year. The comments and reactions to the film ranged from inadvertent and careless to a pleasant exit from the movies about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of South Africa's New Wave, but some of the notable films about our history of apartheid will indeed be ranked among the best in our 110-year film history. It is not surprising that the film disappeared from the theaters in Cape Town just two weeks after its release and from most theaters in Durban and Gauteng. It has a clearly limited appeal among South African audiences.
