Born Again is a substandard episode of the first season. It deals with the theme of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I've never really liked reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy towards this episode. It refers to the case of Tooms, which is a good continuation of the previous episode. But the positive aspects end there. Which is unfortunate because that happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous for a dead man to decide to reincarnate in the body of a completely alien girl. And wait until the girl turns eight to begin to get revenge. There is even a serious lack of witty dialogue between Mulder and Scully to keep the episode afloat. If you are in reincarnation, perhaps this episode is your alley. If you're not, you can at least learn what bradycardia is.
