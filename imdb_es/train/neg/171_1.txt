I thought that Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the water tomb of the first part) was going to be in part 2 I guess not. I just think they should have killed her like Friday the 13th of Part 2 (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> This movie like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 followed the movies inside a movie. <Br /> <br /> This was PURE CRAP! The whole movie inside a movie shit. <br /> <br /> BAD STAY!
