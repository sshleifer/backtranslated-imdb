WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I do not have to pay money to watch this horrible movie. It was as if a nut of history got drunk! The previews made it look decent, but it was REALLY bad. I will say that the idea sounded decent but let's go. It was really very bad. If you would sit down and think about it, you would also realize that it was not realistic. Go back on the day you think you had all those things to work with. It was not as if Ben Franklin sat down one day and did a damn riddle. It was completely ridiculous, and if you want to watch a bad movie, go see this one. All and all the HORRIBLE films could be in my 10 POOREST films that I've seen.
