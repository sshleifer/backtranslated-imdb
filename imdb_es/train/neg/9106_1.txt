From the opening scene, you will realize how hard they tried to imitate the intelligent and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat they landed. You will also notice the terrible choice they made in choosing Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then, in the second scene, there are the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. I mean, if you can ignore the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... Then, the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story for many miles, and notes that Sebastian has already met an Anette in the Last, here is Danielle and Cecile, here she is called Cherie ... What an original it is for a prequel. Then it becomes a kind of low budget movie 'Wild Things' with many and many "twists". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. It's not that he's a bad actor, he's good ... He just does not have the charisma Ryan had. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again offers. But with all the talent in the world, there's no way you can save this crap. In general, this "movie" feels like an episode of 'Beverly Hills, 90210'. The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could not they at least leave that alone ?! You will want to pass this one. If you want more cruel intentions, look at the dangerous relationships of Stephen Frears.
