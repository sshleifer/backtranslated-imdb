It is not mentioned if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "The House Next Door" of his 1970 novel of the same title, or someone else did. This movie similar to Lifetime was directed by the Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a risk when the film was shown on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the commercial ones, which of course, one can not find in this version that we saw. <br /> <br /> The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle, who sports a new look that launched this viewer. A curve due to the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is barely recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the camera. That is true for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors who deserve better. <br /> <br /> The film has a cross-over feeling between "Desperate Houswives" and "The Stepford Wives" and other well-known features, combined with a mild dose of chills. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as the stage.
