Yes. Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it came to the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled story shone in Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from the best movies in the music industry. br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, costumes and more glamorous choreography = more money for the "talented" Beyonce questionnaire. <br /> <br /> Yes Like the style of retreat, you should appreciate the real groups that fought (without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's participation makes this garbage hypocritical.
