UPA movies are surprisingly well classified in IMDb, despite the fact that the quality of the animation is light years away from that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at its best. Unfortunately, due to the increased costs in creating beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 50's and 60's. After all, the films were very cheap to make and had received several Oscar awards to "prove" that the cartoons were now popular. As a result, the lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the first. The characters are drawn in a very simple way (simpler and would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly: simple line drawings with colors added in a very simple way (often with a sponge and almost never filling the elements completely ). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz-style attitude. Some will love this, others will simply find it very, very strong. It is the traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny" and, due to the shootings, it is probably not a great movie for children. Hell, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good movie either. Some will read my criticism and, without a doubt, will think that I am an imbecile (what I am, up to a certain point). However, I love animated films and a bit of this minimalist style of UPA goes very, very far and you can not consider them as great works of art, only cartoons made very, very quickly. Ignore the Oscars and try to see some classic cartoons or something else.
