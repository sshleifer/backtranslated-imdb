Imagine a woman alone in a house for forty-five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens. Then this continues two more times. The writing is flat and lifeless, and the jokes are not fun, and the bad performance prevents you from worrying about any of the characters, even when fighting wolf packs and being beaten up by thugs from the fraternity. Anyone who has rated this movie above two is not completely healthy.
