During the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself: it seems to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster film. At that time I did not know why, I thought it was good, but now I know. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this movie is that it is pure and absolutely unpleasant. I do not care about movies with psychopaths and things, to prove my point of view, let's take Jackie Brown, for example, but they're all terribly superficial in this, but that's obviously meant for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pulling your stomach. Another important problem is the protagonist. It is presumptuous, arrogant, but, ironically, it is not so bad. He does not seem tight enough to be a murderous woman who sells drugs. The fact is that, at the end of the day, this movie is completely pretentious. Not slippery, not smart, just boring and meaningless: this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * of ***** (1 of 5)
