After a quasi-gothic and completely fruity music video, the film begins with Cassidy, the lead singer, who commits suicide. In a perfect world that would be that and the final credits would roll. We do not live in that world. The insipid members of the band decide to go to a clown to get in touch with their dead essence. When I say clown, I mean the real clown. He tells them that they are all going to die through the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit possesses Dora, one of the bandmates). We would not mind less since the characters are boring, insipid and extremely horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly appropriate last name if there ever was one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after The Wizard and the Blood Tower, MUST know that he still makes a living), this film is a constant battle between the incompetence of the film and the need of the viewer to stay awake. There is not enough blood to appease the gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy perverts. In fact, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway goes topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
