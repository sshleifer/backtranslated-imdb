This is a movie that carries some digestion. On the one hand, we are offered a resistant outer shell, a story that not only derives from the Catholic Church, but does so foolishly and without information. In an inner layer, we are offered a history of orthodoxy about orthopraxis, and what happens when people blindly follow a faith they should not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed like this was supposed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; Humor is clumsy and poorly delivered. In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is luxurious and exaggerated, well below the quality of her days at Annie Hall and Sleeper. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridency, with her high-pitched voice and plaintive style. All this could be forgiven if it were not for the last 20 minutes of this film, which was evidently a controversial work done in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Be careful, the spoilers ahead *** <br / > <br /> It all begins with the appearance of four alumni of Sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after their vows under any circumstances, simply because of that fact, just to show you how much tireless research came into the project to begin with.) When everyone admits that they are not up to the teachings of the church, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuses the way the public should do it. He thinks he did it a long time ago when he was in the corny, too-cliched sepia-toned flashbacks. When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the student pulls a gun. After getting away from her, the nun kills the student, probably in self-defense. Then she starts screaming, killing a gay ex-student because of his sins. The last shot is of the dead student lying in a pose similar to that of Christ when a shadow of a cross hangs over her. Can you say `hard hand '? I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know that many people have been emotionally impaired as a result, but this image feeds on our throats on almost every other shot. In this train wreck from a movie. I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a movie about hysteria and why orthodoxy should not be followed so religiously, without a play on words. However, this explanation is difficult to swallow, simply because we are never given an authoritarian viewpoint that is not predisposed against the Catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply an anti-Catholic gut, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a film I would recommend for a Catholic, that is, to awaken her. The realities of what cynicism and ignorance face today. If it were 'Rabbi Ray explains everything' or 'Imam Muhammad explains everything', there would be riots in the streets and Showtime would lose all its subscription. But, sadly, because this is a film that attacks what is perceived as the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope that everyone The member of that cast was a practicing Catholic, so it was not just ignorance that led them to make this film. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, misdirected and just a bad movie in general. Do not even waste your time.
