Robin Williams gave a good performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members. However, the film seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a "must see". I think the problem occurs because there is not a sufficiently strong relationship established between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it this way, because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling of "Nobody"). The film takes a little longer than 1:30 and, in the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the boy who calls. <br /> <br /> This happens after you talk to the mysterious visitor. about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too deep and consist mainly of how you are ... I am in the hospital ... why did you move from your boyfriend ...? In the book, the child almost becomes the shrinkage of Noon and vice. versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he discovers that the child disappears and thinks it could be a hoax. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Noon is obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left wondering why? Since there really is not a strong enough link established between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship were fundamental to establishing on the screen, as it provides the basis for the rest of the movie. As it does not, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When it became a miniseries, it worked perfectly.
