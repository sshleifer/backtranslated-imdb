The first time I chose this movie I was intrigued by the basic idea and was anxious to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and I love it when it successfully merges with live action sequences. However, the animation in this movie was all that I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. The visual aspect, including the animation, gave the piece a wonderfully disconcerting air. However, this was the quality of the concern that was lost between the exaggerated images, both visual and in the script, with which he was practically hit in the head. The most annoying thing about this was the relative lack of importance for the plot. It seemed that the plot was a shoe with horns at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that massively prevented the flow of the piece. Felisberto's voice, especially the one at the end, felt like a desperate attempt to fill in the gaps in the plot that had been ignored in favor of secondary problems like the ants thing (and that was not the case). duly directed). I am afraid that the whole piece was presented as, at best, a "reasonable first attempt" by a teenager who has spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. It is not what you expect from experienced filmmakers.
