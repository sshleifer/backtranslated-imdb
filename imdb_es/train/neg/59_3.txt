Protocol is an unlikely film whose only salvation is that it is starring Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill in the middle of the movie and Goldie's charm simply does not save this movie. Unless you're a Goldie Hawn fan, do not bother watching this movie.
