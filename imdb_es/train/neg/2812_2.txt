I saw this movie recently at a film festival. It is the romance of a former alcoholic employee who has just emerged from a great depression and a middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clichés, taking the "social" theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The main actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks a lot as a "high level" woman. What I want to say is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. All the staging of the film was very poor. The picture is ugly, it is not used well in the whole aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and boring most of the time. The comic situations are typical of Gómez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny and they resolve badly. In my opinion this movie is not worth seeing. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films, can you enjoy this a bit. Anyway, I left the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder how a director feels when he sees someone coming out of one of his films, especially one that is made to please everyone.
