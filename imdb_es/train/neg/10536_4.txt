William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the credit of the director / writer for this entertaining low-budget film about three children who camp out in the woods with their horror magazines. The feet supported by the fire and the schoolboy joke from one side to another ... and a stray street named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface) wanders and exchanges four stories of blood in exchange for food and the warmth of the fire. . <br /> <br /> A story is the old retread of "The Hook", two teenagers in the path of lovers attacked by an insane murderer with a hook by hand. Another story has a couple of tokers who need to mark some grass. They run into a guy who knows a guy who has a big s # @ t. When they smoke a couple of full bags, their skin begins to turn gray and green before it shines and falls. One of the best stories is about an unhappy man who returns home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to die and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth tale of the campfire is about a greedy sailor who gets upset by an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased by zombies in the sea. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES takes everything. Through and really could have been much worse. A bit corny, but fun to watch, except perhaps the sailor tale. The performance is understandable is not worthy of reward. Cast members include: Three Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
