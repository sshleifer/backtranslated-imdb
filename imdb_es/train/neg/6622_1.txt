I, like many other Bachchan fans, have been anxiously awaiting Sholay's remake. This movie was not. Thank God, they were not allowed to use the name "Sholay" in the title of the film. The remake of Ram Gopal is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the places, the costumes, the out of place dance, the dialogue, all combined to make the worst movie I've seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this film because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. The role of Abishek was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay Ash's wedding? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or the DVD when it comes out.
