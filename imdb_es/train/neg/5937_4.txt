Of course, if you ask any mother which is the most beautiful baby in the world, she will tell you that her son is the most incredible child in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The producers of the film were Biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I need to say more? I will break it down for those who do not want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can put together some MTV videos of biggie and call it movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real one in life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why he called himself a little biggie. Great body small cock? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat little eyes?
