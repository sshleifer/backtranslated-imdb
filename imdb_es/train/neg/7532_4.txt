Something that I really love about the short films of this woman was the elusiveness of the theme, especially in "Living with happiness". This movie has some nice beginnings: unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but it fails to succeed with clumsy expository dialogue, irregular presentations and television coverage. <br /> <br /> It is once again a lovely television and very ordinary cinema. Ideas are so developed that they almost feel like a television commercial. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really love to see this director do a full animation and try to work with a producer who does not demand so much boredom. clarity.
