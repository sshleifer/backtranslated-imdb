Now, I like science fiction cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I saw the premiere and was dismayed. The characters are generic and stereotyped (Must they REALLY make an African-American man wear tiger-striped clothes and speak with a Jamaican accent?) WHY are all Asian characters vibrant yellow and their eyes half-closed? mother WHO have big thighs? And the chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, crude and, sometimes, unsettling. There are many similarities with, even stabs, in Astro Boy. Let me explain (names for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Brief similarities with "My life as a teenage robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and company. are underway Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotypes. I do not even mean the insinuations. I'll just say they're hidden and pretty dirty. But, seriously. Do not even try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
