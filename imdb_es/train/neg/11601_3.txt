A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment of the series Nightmare on Elm Street and the worst sequel to the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky to get Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I saw all the sequels. The dreamed child was the worst without a doubt, I was also surprised, as it went very well in the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I was not happy with where I was going. Alice became more upset, it's not Nancy or Kirsten, so carrying this movie alone did not work for me. Freddy is also losing his fear, this was getting a little silly. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is pregnant, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back and he will not be too light with her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyway, he wants his son and be born again in the world. Did you ever wonder if Freddy also had parents? Well, that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street investigates: The Dream Child and Alice soon discovers what Freddy's childhood was like and maybe that's the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone can be happy with this sequel. Just that the story was really silly, I mean it could have worked, but once again, it just ran the wrong way. I know that if you want to see the sequels of the series Nightmare on Elm Street, you should see it, but I really would not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> 3/10
