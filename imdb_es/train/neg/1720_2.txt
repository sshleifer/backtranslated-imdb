A handful of non-professional actors are terrified by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but, oh, how it will crave that margin when, during the rest of the movie, the animation is replaced by production assistants who shake an internal tube with teeth. There is no time for terror when this film is hijacked halfway through these comfortable imitators of renting relief boats, which suddenly become the main characters; But once again, you must admit that seeing them try to be funny is better than walking after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them eats and the other sits on a rock crying tears of loneliness. That is not fun!
