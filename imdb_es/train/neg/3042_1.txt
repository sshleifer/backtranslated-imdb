I am allowed to write 1000 words about this film, but one word could suffice: strange. My husband and I did not laugh so much as we were speechless at this really terrible movie. We keep looking at each other with our best "What ...?" Expressions There is no way to adequately describe this movie. The killer tomatoes were fun, but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them in a movie for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this strange and weird movie and then packages it as if it were appropriate for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your son still believes in Santa Claus, do not let him see this movie. Pre-teens can watch it, probably with "What the ...?" Expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others, you may want to increase your eggnog. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.
