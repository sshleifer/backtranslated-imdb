... just look at the poor character of Robert Webber (a great performance, once again!) trying to fight with a machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little bad. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm foundation in the present of the 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and the much more fantastic, ironic and, therefore, Die Hard). The story is presented as a failed attempt to glorify SAS commands. Ideas like when a command shouts "heads down" all the good guys do it and all the bad guys do not so they can fly ad lib (with good conscience), that the main character is not affected by the gas masked commands, although He wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from his arsenal, they seem unlikely and they make it difficult to take the film seriously. And it happens that it tries to be something more than fun. Do not talk about the episode of the toilet mirror sign ... <br /> <br /> I do not care about the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for wrongdoers and discussions between peace fanatics and established representatives of power, even directed this movie. But the political commentary is quite boring and uninspired. This is unfortunate to the extent that the film presents an early performance by Judy Davies. She plays the main fan and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject. "Anyway, her acting is far superior to that of the others and somehow I feel that the movie disappointed her.
