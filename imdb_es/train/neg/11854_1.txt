For my life, I can not understand the good reviews of this shit. It was useless Matthew Modine was horribly misinformed as one of the leading ladies. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I will reiterate, why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And his performance was simply bad. I do not know if she was accosted by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And about the girl that Modine was in love with, is she suddenly putting half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a ridiculous way? Where did that come from? I think we should feel sorry for her when we saw that her marriage to a workaholic was beginning to fall apart, but frankly, I could not care less about any of these people.
