What the hell has been of our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who did Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped from the high cliff that has risen to give the industry some of the best works of all time. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was anxious to leave the theater, but they forced me to sit down because I could not have taken my car out of the parking lot before others left too. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit beyond the interval. <br /> <br /> This movie is not close to Sholay. It does not even come close to a mile. I think Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days ago, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep more than 4 hours a day, that either in a moment. I completely agree with this now, since your lack of sleep has probably made a dent in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan is not even afraid. It looked more terrifying on the few posters and wallpapers I saw before. Ramu's favorite, Nisha Kothari, did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact, none if I remember clearly). He opened his mouth in this film, and has found a place in history. The new guy who plays the role of Jai seems to have that cheeky appearance, but he could not handle the role of Jai at all. I can not continue ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to handle right now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the film that I will see the original Sholay just to see that it is still there. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: horrible movie. The media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers once again, I am one of Ramu's greatest fans, and I can not even spare him for this act.
