There is more to say than say that this movie was horrible. All Chineseness was awakened in your being because the ancestors were difficult to sell. But to tell the audience that all Chinese know Chinese history without even studying it, it's just ridiculous. That's like saying that all Americans know the history of the United States without studying or all the Filipinos, etc., etc. It just is not credible. <br /> <br /> The story is completely horrible. He talked about Shin being from a monastery in China, and then he identified him from Bejing. However, the first sequences of the film show the map centered on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia by itself, granted. But it is a different nation and even labels "Mongolia" on the map. Did the Disney studios fail in fifth grade geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet somehow she feels connected to him. His training is simply corny too. And, let's cut to the chase: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. The action of Taekwondo was overcome and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The thing with the evil eyes was corny. However, the end left out would have been the only thing descending about it. They should have left the evil eyes ending in her. But in some way evil is defeated. Yey <br /> <br /> In general, it's not worth the time of the dog in the movie. Brenda Song should continue with another study. "F"
