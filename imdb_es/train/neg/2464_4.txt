I loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but, well, what a disappointment is the second part, "The pit of Satan". The suspense of something seemingly rising out of the hole was nothing that came out of the hole. Then, the ages passed by crawling around the vents to eliminate the story, the Beast was a thing full of intelligence, so there was no confrontation between the Doctor and the villain he had been anticipating. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit even though the pit was not opened until long after the TARDIS fell through the crust of the planet. And finally, another ready-to-use solution that existed without any logical reason. I mean, why not sink the Beast into the hole as soon as the well opened? Why not sink it in all those years instead of imprisoning it anyway? Why not? I could go on, but I lost interest ...
