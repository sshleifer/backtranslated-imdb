['There is only one essential thing for a complete appreciation of The Indian Runner. Unzip the pants. Take a look inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? It&#39;s fine, you will. <br /><br /> This film has all the masculine requirements: blood, weapons, car chases, beloved women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquors, violence, pyrotechnics. What have I left out? - Oh, yes, blowtorches. <br /><br /> As a woman, I seriously hope that Sean Penn will consider this as a kind of effort when he was a child ... Since he wrote and directed the thing, he is almost the only one responsible. An unequal distribution (Viggo Mortensen as usual brilliantly demonstrates how work should be done) is about saving Penn. Too late. The lines and the action are there. Even a devout and expert performance can not change that. <br /><br /> I found this film pueril and silly, as well as predictable. The dialogue falters: Sandy Dennis feels respect for trying to give life to a maternal wooden monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, so does the father of the protagonists, played by Charles Bronson. His absence is barely perceptible. <br /><br /> At intervals, the pyrotechnics, etc., indicated above seems to animate things and frighten the audience so that they think something significant is happening. <br /><br /> If you are a man and you are less than 25 years old, you can love this movie. He plans to return to her at 35. Do you think you&#39;ll still like it? <br /><br /> I do not think so.']
