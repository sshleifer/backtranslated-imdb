This movie on the outside was super smart. It's thematic rhymes with every horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO the attempt to be original. What is Valentine anyway? It is a group of people who give the same messages that were given to the same people a year before. There is nothing original in valentine. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, and in that one you see here there are some of the movies that you cheated. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror movie in which someone is killing someone. <br /> <br /> I know there's more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk, so I could not catch them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How is it that every horror movie has to have a "surprise" killer? The people you do not care about because their emotions change every other scene. One minute, a good girl becomes an evil B - ch, then she is an insecure woman, and so on. <br /> <br /> Normally, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by Gore, Once again, Valentine does not have this. It was as if they tried to do it PG-13 but they failed, so they left the edition. <br /> <br /> Do not see this scam too inspired unless you hate yourself and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
