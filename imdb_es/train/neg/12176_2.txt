The original Trancers are not, in any way, a great movie. It had massive plot holes and very little in internal logic. However, it was entertaining, better done than most low budget movies, and could be surprisingly ingenious. Unfortunately, Trancers II is none of these. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers many of the same problems as most flop sequels. The plot is thin enough to see it and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that recovering the familiar faces of the first movie would be enough, and did not bother about anything else. Not even veteran Grade B actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs could drag this movie out of the garbage. <br /> <br /> A brief summary of the plot: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a policeman of the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of the members of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first movie, and they both live with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent to protect. It was discovered that the brother of Whistler (the bad boy of the first film) has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers, people who became zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, who had died long before Jack traveled into the past, was also returned to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack is working with her. <br /> <br /> Two real problems with this movie. One is that the method to create Trancers in this film is radically different from the methods used in the first film. What makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of Soviet revisionism, they act as if it were the technique. <br /> <br /> The other thing that bothers me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) has very little screen time. This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. It felt like it was just something that was thrown out to fill the space in the movie. The character of Alice in particular does not seem worried about the fact that she meets with her husband only to discover that she has remarried, which makes her very superficial or very badly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think to watch this movie is if you are interested in watching the complete series of Trancers (currently a total of six movies). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original Trancers, get away from this warm sequel.
