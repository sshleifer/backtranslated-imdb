Totally pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast would not have even done studies in Allen's previous films. And having to listen to the flamboyant Will Ferrell do his imitation of Woody Allen makes me hate Ferrell second-rate (though mysteriously popular) even more. It seems that the ill-humored Allen, 70, should have left work when the clock rang in a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was simply impossible; My friends could not shoot so slowly. So, instead of falling asleep and killing the evening sleeping in an upright position, I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a very good book to reread (the great volume by George Bailey 30 years ago, "Germans." The day turned out quite well, after all, not thanks to Woody.
