Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, gets stuck on a snowy mountain and faces the difficult decision of eating the flesh of their dead companions to survive. Does it sound familiar to anyone? I mean "Alive" from 1993. The only important difference here, of course, is that a big white raven, drunk and scared of a Yeti appears a few times to drag the dead. I guess humans know better than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when he hunts the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would have exploded in the air, exploded when it hit the ground, or it would have been destroyed. People would not have survived, but hey, it's science fiction. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they survived and they are cold. It might be a good idea to take advantage of some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death. As the fire is warm ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot frost formed on his face while he is alive and talking, but, curiously, nobody else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the plane IN FIRE around him. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they find coats and hoodies and, nevertheless, they are there. In the cold of the Himalayas, you can not wear the hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: they are looking at a lot of sticks when, I repeat, there are pieces of the plane WHENEVER BURNT. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the Himalayas are known for their storms. It would be common sense for them to collect the debris to reinforce its structure instead of being outside arguing. There are many pine trees around, whose branches make an excellent isolation. <br /> <br /> WTF: If in doubt, use the arm of a dead man as a splint. <br /> <br /> WTF: If you only know a lot about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, why do not you know enough to take refuge and set traps from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: when you try to catch wild animals, a meaningless conversation near the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen one? corpse with a piece of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were helpless there. The Yeti tore the boy's heart and trampled the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There's love. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever ... or so we believe. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues with more idiocy, but most of the action happens in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Pleasant to think with the javelin and the chain, although this is something of ingenuity (with the chain of magical appearance) that they lacked at the beginning of the film when they could not even make fire despite the fact that everything was around them. <br /> <br /> As is typical of the Sci-Fi Originals, the loving couple kisses at the end as if nothing horrible had happened to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and have not brushed their teeth in several days) ). <br /> <br /> The ending, however, is lame quote.
