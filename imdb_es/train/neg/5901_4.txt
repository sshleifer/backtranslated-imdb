Something to Sing About was produced at Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked while under contract with the Warner brothers. He made two films for Studio B, none of which has a high rank in the credits of Cagney. <br /> <br /> One of the big losses for the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney made so few movies that they used his incredible dance skills. . The two that come to mind immediately are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two minor films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never used to see anything other than his musicals in retirement. So, why did so few of them? <br /> <br /> Well, this one was completely wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About refers to a hoofer who is facing a band that has discovered and given a movie contract. There are the usual complications of a deceptive head of study and a deceptive press agent played respectively by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract requires a non-marriage clause, so Cagney and the band singer, Evelyn Daw, get married in secret. Then we get the complication of a studio romance driven by advertising with the screen's protagonist, Mona Barrie. I think you can imagine where this is going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. Dance briefly at the beginning and end of the movie and swim in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a beautiful singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the audience that goes to the movies was paying their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> Besides giving her some dance numbers, a dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Were not Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> There were no memorable songs. And Daw's voice is also tense. She has a voice of soprano Jeanette MacDonald that was so out of place with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
