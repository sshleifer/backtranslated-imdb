In this strangely indifferent apocalypse, the world suffers a double plague of zombies and vampires, but nobody seems to be too concerned about this in this Grade-Z movie that bears less resemblance to the famous Sheridan novel Le Fanu than the lasagna of my mother. recipe. Bored attendants still run service stations and doctors continue to make home visits and useful police officers keep popping up with radiator fluid when they need it. The plot, and I use that term lightly, involves a father and a daughter who try to have a bad temper with "the general", whose daughter is missing, in a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, travels with father and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found among vast expanses of unintentional humor. The film also has enough nudity to keep a fourteen-year-old interested. Someone older be careful.
