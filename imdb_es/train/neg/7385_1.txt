The movie is boring, the characters and the scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. It almost seems that when action music kicks in, the most impressive trick is running. Or the voice doubles with Mr. McGregor or steven sang too much and changed his voice. There are too many dialogues in this movie, and it is extremely wrong to act on everyone's behalf. The movie is great for sleep therapy. The fight is laughable. The effect of changing the shape of the eyes on women addicted to drugs by the evil designer was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was underdeveloped. The main villain was used to explain the story through an interrogation, he would simply throw random plots like (spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) will be in the water supply," which is never addressed in the conclusion nor He mentions again in the movie. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
