My wife and I have just seen BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the movie. I really wish I had taken a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and annoying that I could not sleep. When our protagonist speaks, I want to listen to Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. Neither does it have redeeming qualities. I expected to be hit by a bus in five minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really do not have any damn sense at all. If you want good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror. Avoid The Booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
