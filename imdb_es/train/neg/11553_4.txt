Francis Ford Coppola had a brain aneurysm some time after directing "Apocalypse Now" that made him absolutely unable to make a good movie? <br /> <br /> You have to ask yourself what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" thought when he made this flabby movie. He gives Kathleen Turner a vehicle protagonist, playing a woman who travels in time and remakes her adolescence knowing all the things that adult life has taught her, and Turner, the soldier that is, does what he can with but this Movie can not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> It does not even have any style and, given its director, one could hope that even if he had nothing else, he would have to. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
