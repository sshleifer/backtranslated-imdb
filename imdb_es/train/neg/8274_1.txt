Ahh, this movie had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... that's it! <br /> <br /> I think a guy in an anonymous marketing department had an idea. Basically, let's make a kind of legally blonde film, but let's do it in New York. That great city shining with opportunities, power and money, and where all are heartless people, hungry for power / money. Add to this Jessica Simpson, bimbo from a small town, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some apparent reason, Andy Dick (only because of him he must ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Basic story: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl for New York, the girl follows him, the boy cheats, the girl stays in New York with her cousin, He gets a job with false pretenses, gets angry with another boy (Brother Wilson) and together they save the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> some words come to mind when reflecting on this film, that is, terrible, terrible, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Just do not watch this movie, you will be more happy. A critic referred to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This movie induces shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least sometime I'll see Simpson naked or close too. It will not happen, save your time and YouTube. It will have a sexier time! <br /> <br /> The movie editing is flimsy, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In conclusion; this is a cinematic betrayal that should be punished to the fullest <br /> <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson movie and why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?
