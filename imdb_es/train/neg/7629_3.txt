I gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to take to hell out of the audience, even when the egotist Bogdanavich (who performed better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" from a ton of hams in his debuts. From this movie come many clich√©s about teenage sex, such as Making the teacher's wife, Impotence, Making the ugly prostitute (which is very clumsy and makes things stop completely, not that things really go anywhere anyway) and skinny immersion. <br /> <br /> I guess this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the nonsense of sex, for me, it was just annoying. I was seriously more entertained cleaning my nails than watching this disaster.
