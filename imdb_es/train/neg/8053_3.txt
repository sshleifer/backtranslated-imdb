As a premise, this backward version of the Dead Calm story was promising. <br /> <br /> However, the inability of director Eric Red to represent a convincing hurricane leads to an avalanche of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the viewer is more bewitched by the strange effects of weather than by the intended story. The endless fringes of the direction in which the cold cuts of the ham distract in a similar way. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, doing a game of 'legs of virgin wood', does everything possible to save the film. But ultimately, Undertow screams like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
