This movie seemed to have everything in its favor with good camera, sound, movies, stages, music, costumes ... but the drummer, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it was his bad performance or just a bad script, but I would say it was both. Considering his role in this role, I found it difficult to encourage him to the end. I wished he had died in battle or one of the fights with the sword / knife. <br /> <br /> Then, the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner or have sex with him. Queen? Pretty lame And to go to the extreme to kill his own son? And then to raise his lover as successive King? I see a thread or two of historical bytes here and there, but the way this was presented was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not recognize Gary Stretch for anything else, but it was terrible. I read another user's comments about the audio dubbing, but I do not think his dubbing ... after all, he speaks English, right? It really was horrible. The lines were read right next to the coroner's table ... flat line. It could be that he simply does not have the voice to carry the tone fluctuations. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I saw it until the end, so the film had at least one "interest". It could have been more if the script / lines and the casting had been given more work. The scenery and the film crew along with a very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else. The cast and the story were all secondary. I give the film crew a 10.
