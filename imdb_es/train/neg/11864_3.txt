The characters in the depth less rip offs. You've seen all the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be nervous and unpleasant, but it fails miserably. throws a bit of hangover and comedy of superbad but the jokes are out of the left field, completely forced, and ignored almost completely after they break. The hot girl is old and has no personality, she is just a blonde girl in her mid-thirties, with some wise men who are not underwear and use jokes that are less than attractive. the attraction between Molly (the hot girl) and Kirk (the loving dorky) hardly communicates. The attraction is nowhere found is a completely platonic relationship until an uncomfortable and predictable kiss occurs in the seatbelt. After this, they are in full relationship and incredibly lame. The main focus of this film is not the relationship, but a failed attempt to make a super-bad-esquire movie with a semi-attractive plot. I could compare it to the hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into that. I could go on, but it's just useless. Just do not pay to see this movie.
