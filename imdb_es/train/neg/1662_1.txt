This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen. This makes your television movie career look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the only Britney Spears and her mother, this is crap, nothing more than a reasonable return from Virginia Madsen (I hope you have been well paid) to save him. The story of a red-necked gill country who wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school is small, but a vehicle for pedaling Mrs. Spears' music to the consumer and generally agrees that the low scowl should be the path. There is nothing good here with all the rhythms as predictable as the night after day. Never more.
