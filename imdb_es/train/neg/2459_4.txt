Obviously, I did not care so much for Things to come (aka "The way things are to come") as most viewers. That means there's a good chance that you enjoy it more than me. In any case, it may be useful to listen to the movie described from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and more as an art director. , this is a film adaptation of HG Wells from his own novel of the same name. In my opinion, it helps to show why a great novelist does not necessarily become a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in 1940 in an "Everytown" like the one in London. The war is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that I can reach them. He does it. And it becomes a matter of decades that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to advance in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one shot down, who come to an agreement with the consequences of their fight. We met with a post-apocalyptic community governed by a possible leader. We meet a man from a growing futuristic society. We see the way technology is changing. And, finally, we take to the full realization of that futuristic society around 2036, where the leaders debate the merits of sending man to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may all sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work like a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, with little to dramatically unite it. In the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to track the characters. He had barely been able to classify them in the first couple segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We do not learn anything about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that the individual segments, with a couple of exceptions, tend to be directed and edited in an uncomfortable way. Sometimes, they are also manipulators: you can almost begin to feel like a propaganda movie. But perhaps in a contradictory way, the segments are also a bit cold and emotionally dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, a too large section is more like an industrial promotional video / music video. If you include images of the construction of the futuristic city, with a lot of big machinery, a lot of welding, etc. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an exaggerated terror score. I can not say that Things to Come consists of attractive material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is "a movie about ideas". That may be true, but there are a couple of problems with it if it looks that way. One, it still does not make it work like a movie, that is, as a visual and auditory dramatic art, and two, there are too many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that War and what it does to civilizations. That's a good thing to make a movie. It is also noticeably cautious of World War II, as things to come were written and recorded in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the movie. For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is erupting, or it will at any time. The general message seems a bit pessimistic. Wells seems to be demonstrating that war is simply a part of human nature that can not be eliminated, although it does not exclude "progress"; in fact, perhaps it fuels progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would certainly be enough for a movie. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the most moving scenes in the film. It is a complex dilemma. One pilot has knocked down the other, but now he comes to help him. But the pilot who was knocked down was carrying a poisonous gas that now flies in the field. They can not both breathe the gas without damage. A girl is coming. They only have two gas masks that work between them. The pilot who was shot down offers his mask, since he says he is dying anyway. What to do? It is not that this scene in itself extends to the length of the film, but the ideas, the weird complex of helping each other and trying to hurt each other in the middle of a war, are enough to build a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes with the possible leader, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is an unpleasant contagious disease called "errant disease". Turn the victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims at the scene in an attempt to avoid the disease. This material is treated as if it were a last minute idea. It's a great idea and he deserved his own movie. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents the society of the future with controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for his own movie, too. It is simply impossible to effectively deal with so many things in 100 minutes, especially when it is supposed to be the crucial point of the film rather than the dramatic appeal. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to give things to come at least one visit. If you are a fan of science fiction, this is a film of historical importance. Given Menzies' background, the production and sets are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely antiquated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was prescient or retrospectively comical in his "predictions". I especially enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which strongly recalled the Journey to the Moon of 1902 by George Méliès (also known as Le Voyage dans la lune). Just do not expect too much of things to come.
