As someone who likes the chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating real-life story, I was optimistic when entering this movie, but too many obstacles stood in the way of the good story it should have been. <br /> <br /> THE BAD: I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is boring as an insurance researcher. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold It's the real mouth of garbage. From what I read, there were several directors who replaced each other in this movie, and that's very bad. You can say that things are not right with the story. I could not "get involved" with the portrait of Cooper Williams of Treat. It should have been fascinating, but it was not in this movie. It is also a very sad comment that a guy who commits a crime is a kind of "popular hero", but I admit that I also ended up supporting the man. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the landscape, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this film re-done and better, because it is a unique story.
