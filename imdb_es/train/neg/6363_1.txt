I still have not seen anyone in this movie and I think I can be the first one. <br /> <br /> It was horrible. Actually I did not see the end of this. It was like watching a boring soap or a really good soap (all soaps are garbage). The actors were poor and the plot was bad. The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what it is. The script was horrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation that involved threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and hit him, but no. He says: "If you do that ... I will hurt you" Hahaha. If comedy is your thing, be careful. Please, do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP! <br /> <br /> Summary: bad acting, bad fights, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not look! Of course this is in my opinion.
