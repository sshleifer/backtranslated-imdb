Hi HULU.com is playing Elvira's nightly horror show on her site and this movie is under her Monsterid name, it's fun to see Elvira's comment on this Crappy movie ... Have fun with bad movies. Anyway, this movie really has very little value, apart from seeing how bad the 70s were for horror movies, Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movies. Avoid this unless you want to laugh about it. While you are at HULU, check out the other movies that are in this moment. There are 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plot and production, and you can see many of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
