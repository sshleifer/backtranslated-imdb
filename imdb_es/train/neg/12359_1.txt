I thought this was a really horrible movie, I found myself screaming at my TV a couple of times. One or both of the homosexual male characters were ill-prepared; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo seemed to prefer to be kissing a dog. The film covers his long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break and makeup, but without developing the intermediate reasons in any detail. These reasons would make some interesting characters, not the fight or the makeup scene in bed (I take it even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it does not make it worthwhile to rent the movie. Save your money
