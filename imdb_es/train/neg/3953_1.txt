I can not believe that this movie was allowed to do. These people must be drugged and beaten with blunt objects. They must be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It is nothing more than images of the first movie. What is original is strange and does not make any sense. It's like a kind of drug hallucination. As in the case of naked therapy in a mirror. Besides, whatever the jerk this turd has put together, he did not even bother to watch the first movie, because they kept calling Natalie, the character of Suzanna Love, when she was Lacey. I felt like screaming that on the screen, "IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY !!!!". I give it a -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
