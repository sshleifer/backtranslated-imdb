Do not let the premise fool you, this was a fun movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. The story prepares you well for an ending that never comes. Worse, the configuration is never explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is that it?" I rate it with 2 simply because there were some brief moments of promise, but the ending leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did the job as good as you can expect on paper, but he had very little to work with. There are strange quirks, and interesting twists everywhere, that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this video come out before spending your money.
