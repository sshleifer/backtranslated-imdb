I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved the ordinary man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a movie about that. And when a local network showed the movie, it was in heaven. I was ready for a night of fun! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had thrown Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man who became famous for running and shooting movies could play a more cunning role, as described in the book. I was still convinced that this would be a good movie, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not. I soon discovered that the only reason he was chosen was because someone had rewritten the whole story to DO IT about the fight and the "shooting". Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: the hero is wrong, the hero solves the problems by flexing his powerful muscles and scaring everyone and the hero stays with the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is not what the book says at all. I know that books can not be literally put on the screen, but this did not even have links to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and should have banned the use of the title The Running Man for this shameless film waste. I do not say it often, but this movie was BAD. If I was not at home looking, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: bad. <br /> <br /> (Keep in mind that I used a lot of "someone." I did this because I'm sure many people are ashamed to have worked on this and I do not want to). embarrass them even more by naming them here)
