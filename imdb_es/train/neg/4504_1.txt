A slow, tedious and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with cliche dialogue, boring plot and a soulless address of Mr. Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution in the Asian continent lacks heart, new perspectives and depth. The main character looks out of place due to his tiny contact lenses of physical and false appearance. The lexicon used by the geishas sounds forced and a little too sophisticated because of their limited exposure in the forms of education. The story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you that this small, boring and flat-chested Asian girl is the last Geisha. Actually, they say in the movie "It is destined to become a legend". I say everything! The movie is simply boring, it's beautiful to watch, it has very few interesting moments, as many as you can find when going out to smoke cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger, you will not believe the message, and this girl did not fill the shoe! Borin, bored, jump!
