This is really terrible: the stylized, painfully irritating artists chirp and assault the incoherent dialogues that occur in scenes that seem to have no purpose, no beginning, middle or end, cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention, all at Some "history" service totally uninteresting and almost undetectable. What makes it worse are the pretensions of the "style" movie: suddenly, a remote-controlled crane shoots a downward spiral and, for no apparent reason, there are sudden satodos or trembling hand sections: all this "style" it simply serves to magnify the almost incredibly huge idea of ​​the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
