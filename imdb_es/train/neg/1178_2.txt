The completely ridiculous "period" movie is just a small excuse for its extensive and graphic depiction of the heroine issue with "the beast", a monster that supposedly appears every century to rape some women. That's pretty much what he does, and the description of the movie of the beast is really horrible; He is basically a tall man in a leather suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a belching that sheds large amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I think this is a true ignition. However, I entertained the initial photos of horses that had sex in a public square.
