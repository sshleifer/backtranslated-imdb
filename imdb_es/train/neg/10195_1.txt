The writer / director of this movie obviously does not know anything about the movie. I think the DP in this project was tied and replaced by a monkey, because each view was too dark or had the spots hotter than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone to have said that this movie was made for poker fans and not for movie fans, that someone is joking (it was probably the writer / director). No fan of poker in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Entering a casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your day job. And if you are playing poker, then you must be hurt.
