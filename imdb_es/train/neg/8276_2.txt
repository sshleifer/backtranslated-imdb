I knew that this movie was not going to be amazing, but I thought I would give it a try. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought he had potential. Unfortunately, much of the dialogue in the film was very fake and corny. I think Aquafresh gave some money for the production of the film because they were dropping some clues in earnest. There is a shot in which the Aquafresh sign appears that you can not miss. Maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times we can leave Aquafresh products in the film without people getting upset. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
