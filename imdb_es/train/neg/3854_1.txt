Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who with the guidance of a renowned agent has great potential. Obviously, the person who guided her in this parody is not someone who cares about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who came out en masse to find another movie to sneak out and ask me who thought this movie would attract anyone. It was badly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously did not care.
