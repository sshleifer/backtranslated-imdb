The book is so good that at least the opening of this film made for television will move him, but then, as he moves further and further away from the book, he eliminates all religion, love and mathematics and places clich√©s of cotton candy . , it becomes boring. However, from the comments I have heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if the fact is that even in children read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Uncle Albert of Mary Poppins (I love to laugh). Nothing is as twisted as that of the characters on the screen who laugh hilariously at things that are totally ungraceful.
