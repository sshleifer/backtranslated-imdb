This is a typical Steele novel production in which two people who have suffered some kind of tragedy manage to meet despite the odds. I would not call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how EVERYONE ends. If you do not want to know much about the plot, do not keep reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French descent who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making movies where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise, is a good actress, can not perform any type of accent in a realistic way. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is kind, convincing and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach through their daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the child. . They all become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two protagonists is not excellent, although the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotyping. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together. I wish there was more than that, but in a few words. <br /> <br /> I wanted nonsense entertainment, and I got it with this. As for the genre of romantic movies, this one is not memorable. "A secret affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), like some of Steele's previous books turned into a movie.
