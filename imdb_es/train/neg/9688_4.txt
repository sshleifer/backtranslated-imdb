Greenaway films are presented as witty, erudite and innovative. However, its style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the era of the First World War: the frame, the use of half the shot, the static camera. It may be good to rub against conventional movies with this style, but it is not new. Perhaps like the other "innovator", TS Eliot, is based more on the past than on looking forward as a true innovator would or could do. <br /> <br /> However, Greenaway's biggest flaw is that he can not write. Its structure of dialogue and even plot is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most evident is in his humor, which is balanced and logical, so the joke is dead before being delivered. The result is tedium: if it is not funny, it has failed: ask a comedian to justify his act if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the well-read director can learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They speak the lines with bored and presumptuous air like narcissistic adolescents. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is worthy.
