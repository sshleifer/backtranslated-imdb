I just watched this movie and decided to see what others thought. I wonder if these people who give enthusiastic reviews saw the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it does not reach the mark. The script is very weak: the plot has so many holes that it would be an excellent immersion network for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the plot jumped so much that I found myself asking the question "How do we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry among the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the filming. It was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but they did not commit to their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a hot bath and save money for something worthwhile!
