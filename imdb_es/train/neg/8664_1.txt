This is just a joke from a movie, I got lost in the initial scene (Spoilerwarning), the dangerous creature kills another creature in its cage, this is observed by a scientist who works there on a monitor and guess what she does, well Come on in the cage to see things, omg, how foolish do those writers who are human beings think? It's the same as jumping into a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your colorful fish ... Quite useless and even more foolish. And I'm not even going to talk about the cast because it's not worth the effort. why they did not fire the guy who wrote that immediately is a mystery to me ... And this stupidity continues the whole movie. The only good thing is that the CGI is better than the average for this type of low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If these kinds of things do not bother you, go see them, but keep in mind that your IQ is above 60. You will probably hate it
