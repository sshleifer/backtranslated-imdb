Maybe I'm missing something because I've read more positive things about the man who cheated on himself than the bad reviews, and I just do not understand it. I like that my friends have a bit of style with the characters that speak, they look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. Its wrinkled, rolled out of bed is almost as far from the black archetype as it is. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the fatal woman as another example. This is one of the worst cases of errors I've seen in a long time. She is not convincing on paper. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, she is tired and lacks real surprises or something new for the genre. I could have predicted the result of the man who deceived himself after about five minutes. And that final scene of cat and mouse chase is simply boring. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined the pace of the movie.
