So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies, and then there's KEVIN, the biggest imbecile in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, spoiled and virgin girlfriend AMY. When he returns from work to ... a random house ... he finds his "friends", the short red KYLE that confuses sexually and the truly lazy and repugnant DAPHNE. Soon they were joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the crazy lunkhead crazy for sex and unchained. And there are the creatures of the title, small gruesome puppets that kill people giving them the desire of their hearts. The desire of Kyle's heart is to mate with a spooky and creepy spandex woman. The desire of Nick's heart is to throw grenades in the cafeteria of an elementary school ... I mean a nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to hit a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting bitch. Daphne is already a disgusting whore, so she has no heart desires. On the way, a truly horrible band sings a really strange song. The hobgoblins return randomly from where they came and then explode. "Citizen Kane" can not put a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
