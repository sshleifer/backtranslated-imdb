If you have not seen the TV show gong show, then you will not like this movie very much, it is not that knowing that the series makes this a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10 because some things make it pretty fun and help compensate for their obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a fun snapshot of the time it was made, in the late 70s and early 80s. 2) You have a lot of funny jokes from people you've seen on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he is not making his TV personality. 4) You can see many strange people doing all kinds of oddities as you see on the television show. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to list all the bad things because there are many of them, but here are some of the highlights. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show movie has many of the television show clips that get tired by the end of the movie. 2) The story line of the movie outside the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of a single raster point. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing the typical thing over the plain of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you do not You have an hour and a half that you want to see everything at once. Look 20 minutes at a time and it's not too bad. But even then it is not so good either. ;)
