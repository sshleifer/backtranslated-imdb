Just a scam of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage has lasted eight years. I'm sure that most of the people who saw this non-entertaining garbage were sixty and seventy years old and simply connected because they had nothing better to do, or they just remembered their star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, was never a great actor (according to his own admission) and was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. It seems quite old. A result of years of chain smoking and excessive drinking. His untalented, real-life son Barry, a wooden actor who has rarely been in something that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
