If you are a fan of really bad movies, and you think they are fun, you will do the great performance of Shaq. First of all, putting professional players in movies almost never works. Shaq had to be the worst actor I've seen with Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad movies. Well, anyway, this movie is also bad because of the horrible child. I would give him a zero but that is impossible.
