I was expecting some kind of in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was a decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by an exaggerated voice predicting disaster and a voice sensationalist. One of the worst traditions of television production. <br /> <br /> If I could cut the voice off and change the turn of the program to a positive testimony of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve an unusual goal. Ordinary then this could have been great, but I feel like I've lost about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60-minute show. I want those minutes back.
