This movie was an absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4 hours! It is true that Kargil's war may have had several points that were captured and fought for, but it is not necessary that each and every one of those battles have been demonstrated. So, maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertised. Of course it did not look like it, since there was not enough background information and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed with the man who gave sequences well done in Border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This could be a spoiler). The whole army marches uphill, five or more soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same combination each time), one of the main actors is shot, someone shouts for a stretcher, the actor says: "No, no you put a stretcher, that will take 6 men from the battalion, "and then an actor dies. That exactly the same happens over and over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actresses had the tiniest roles. Everyone is dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were crying in sync. It was so funny They moved their hands and heads at exactly the same time and then bit down on the dupatta. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyway, I think I've hit the movie enough to get the picture.
