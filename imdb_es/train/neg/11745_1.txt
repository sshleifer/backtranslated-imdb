The fact that I did not like music is a very personal opinion, historical inaccuracies are not. I realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people falsely comment because of it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abbas was the mastermind of this operation, which was carried out and reorganized due to the discovery on board the ship, to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a Atrocious terrorist whose story can be found by searching for "Klinghoffer Samir Kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that came to the WTC, right? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost excuses the actions and reactions of terrorists due to the horrors they might have experienced, always accentuating and exaggerating how much that the Israelis have done to hurt them. However, they never portray the pain that the Palestinians have caused the Israelis. The film uses (quite horrible!) Images of the horror of Sabra and Shatila, and nothing is said, which underlines the general belief that Israel was responsible, not to mention that it was a Syrian army-the Lebanese who led the massacre. <br /> <br /> The performance was generally very bad, but I guess that's what you can expect from the opera singers. <br /> <br /> On another note, I am surprised how a person can excuse the terrorists from killing a hostage because the hostage tried to shake the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, adding that the person should not be Considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how unfriendly his wife was, spitting on terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as her (wink, wink)
