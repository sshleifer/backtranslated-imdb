Years ago I saw The Godfather and it impressed me in a lasting way, the atmosphere of the film was first class, the memorable performance and the plot a classic. I recently bought the Trilogy and, after seeing Part 1, I looked anxiously at Part 2 ... I was very pleased to realize from the beginning of Part 2 that here was an appropriate follow-up to the great Godfather movie, again, everything was almost perfect and could not wait to see Godfather III ... BAD! I wish I had stopped in II! The story was not good, it seemed like a story made only to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protégé was a weak character who would have eaten alive in the Godfather 1 or 2. Then, scenes like Corleone were invested in all the traps of the Catholic Church with the full choir, the assassin who rode on horseback sun, the invisible helicopter firing machine from the meeting (where the 'goodies run away and everyone else gets shots), daughter and cousin cousin rolling pieces of pasta across a board, the pathetic shot on the steps ... Corleone stuffing sweets with him orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will in the world I will not be able to see it again. But I will see 1 and 2 many times over the years.
