There is no way in the world that you care about any of these characters. A group of spoiled middle-class children take some drugs at a party and get together and argue. I just saw this on TV and I did not think it was a 'movie' as such, plus an indulgence after 'This life' that really has no resonance or proper drama. Things like this will take care of for an unmemorable time unfortunately, an irrelevant crap of middle-class "lifestyle" that is taken too seriously. You have David Baddiel and that "cold feet" bird, you know what to expect. There were many of these things in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise ... "they are educated and they do drugs, they are friends, but somewhat dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships. This kind of nonsense, and after Guy Ritchie comedy - gangster stuff ... dark days. If you like it, this will bother you to the point of violence.
