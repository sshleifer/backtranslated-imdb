I rented this horrible movie. The worst I've ever seen. I think a 1st grade class could have done a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. Nothing scary, except that I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the movie is just a piece of trash. The scenes of the slauther house are so low budget that they make a B look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is that if you want to lose a good night and a little money, you can rent this horrible movie. I'd rather see killer clowns from outer space while I'm sitting in a bucket of razor blades than sitting on this flop again.
