I'm not sure who is writing these brilliant <br /> <br /> critiques for this movie, but trust me, STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and slasher movies and this is LAME, it only lasts about 80 minutes and believe me it's all I can take. The plot is terrible, the performance is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's films are better than this. Run away from JIGSAW. I expected to hate acting, which can be forgiven directly in video films, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> This was not afraid, very little Gore, <br /> <br /> and a really unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I saw him with three other friends <br /> <br /> that I hope they are still talking to me. <br /> <br /> They wanted me to throw the Disc out the window. I can not believe that someone has been able to <br /> <br /> give a good review to this gut.
