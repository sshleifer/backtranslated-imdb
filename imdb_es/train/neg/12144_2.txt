Although nothing can be compared to vampires vs. Zombies ... in any area of ​​film making I will try to judge this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the special effects were impressive. When there was an explosion on the TV screen, I thought that my whole house was going to explode, and when the machine guns were fired, I thought that the projectiles were landing on the floor right next to me. Simply amazing my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene where the sound of Jack Black is like that of a worst monologue I've ever heard, I almost killed myself, but do not worry since he was on fire The movie may to pass his horrible performance in "I must be tall". Seriously, he must have seen himself babbling without thinking about non-congruent thoughts that do not make any sense and just added that he must be "tall" to justify his horrible performance. Well, if you can say that to excuse the terrible performance, then if you talk to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you'll probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was surprised not to have placed a cut-out shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this terrible and terrible excuse for a movie was reproduced. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you should be killed <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> The General
