I found out about this movie because the Jew Ben Chaplin of Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British comedy and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this movie. He failed thanks to God. <br /> <br /> The movie is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she believes that Ben Chaplin will not like her because she is ugly. The movie is bad for many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable from the openly slapstick bits to the serious serious ones: ugh just that montage where the three are having fun and then the photography bit. Those two scenes made me tremble! The character of Janeane is disgustingly arrogant (and to guess about his role as "comedian" and "archifemist" is also in real life). She claims that the film is "anti-feminist" when in reality it is realistic. Men more often than not by personality. It is interesting to note their hypocrisy too. She had been a feminist and "comedian" for years before taking this role and then, suddenly, she decided that the movie was bad. I imagine he hated the idea and the script of this movie before it was released, but he made sure that he kept that silence to get paid for this parody of a movie. Well then! She acted on it for the love of God! What this movie was really was anti-men, if anything. He presents men as stupid animals whose brains are in their English with men who do stupid things to attract the attention of Noelle de Uma Thurman's character. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things in this movie, like Ben Chaplin's character. the British man that all American girls find cute and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's best black friend and, of course, Foxx had to try to imitate his accent a few times. Is that the best writers can get? Blimey, they've never done it before, except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movie ever made. There is also a really horrible sexual scene that is simply grotesque and shows how cheap the movie is. The other comments here say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but she is actually beautiful. Erm, were you watching the same movie as them? She certainly does not look and the only good thing about this movie is that she was chosen as the ugliest. Although that said, I also do not see Uma Thurman's appeal: she's skinny and emaciated. <br /> <br /> I guarantee you three things about this movie if you've never seen it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what the ending will be; <br /> <br /> You'll find the phone sex scene embarrassingly embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You'll get bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
