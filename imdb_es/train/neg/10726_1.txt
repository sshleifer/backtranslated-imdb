I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and makes you wander about what is to come ... What is nothing. All open history lines remain open; two characters that at first seemed to be of some importance are completely outside the image, with the exception of 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilya would not have been better to leave them completely ... As for the remaining character, nothing is done with her either. Just visit a terrible place and, suddenly, the film is no longer about her, but some geriatric witches who spend the days making dolls with bread, drinking homemade vodka and apparently making flashes between them. Some may say that the film does well to show a crumbling society, like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it is simply distasteful, bad camera work, a terrible script and a terribly bad direction. Therefore, I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to qualifying: 1!
