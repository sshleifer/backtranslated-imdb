A group of us who saw this movie are really upset. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character that Jo was not in (it's not as if the writers / producers could do anything about it). The writing was poor, the script was inferior to the average. What REALLY bothered us: 1. When the two boys realized that they were both dating Natalie, they not only left, but endured that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest, but only because they were men competing with males, not because I really loved Natalie. 2. Despite not being able to choose between the two types before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of them and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he really was a better man, it's as if the writers flipped a coin and then let it spit at some convenient moment in the movie). 3. Blair says she does not want to have children and, suddenly, when her husband says he wants to have children, she happily agrees with him.
