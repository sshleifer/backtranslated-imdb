From time to time in the Indian cinema there is a film like Sholay that changes the way the public perceives a good movie. And give only from time to time (hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so old you can smell it from a distance. Taking a classic like Sholay and murdering him is totally unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had many elements of folklore, the film managed to develop its plot by simply defining the characters in such a distinctive way that they lived forever. What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so much that you will need a contest to choose the worst. The element of realism is missing and what the film ends up providing is a group of "actors" who parade in a less plot and a set of apparently unrelated events. A star for this movie is a ridiculous waste of vote. It is time for RGV to awaken to the reality of its failure and evoke another "different" plot that can be classified in the cinema.
