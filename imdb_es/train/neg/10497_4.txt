So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to jump into a river that is clearly full of crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tons of reptile poop mentioned and mud, not only daily, but enthusiastically. He was never able to make ME want to do it, but he got his wife to come closer. <br /> <br /> This film does not fit into my parallel universe of the category of films: films for people who have just had their teeth pierced, have migraine or have no cinematic experience and, therefore, they like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney movies). It is very noisy. Well, Steve is too loud. He is so happy all the time, and directly crosses the blas√© teenager (now I hear him saying "that movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm is contagious, but if he were, he would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they are beautiful, but I still will not caress them. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable. The bad guys were so bad, that for a moment I thought I was buying in an electronic consumer supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, from what I saw. That plot (if I could call it that) was really another reason to throw another crocodile in a truck. My expectations were low and I kept it that way. <br /> <br /> I expected, however, that there would be a continuation, where Steve and Terri (after having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real Plot and more animals with fur. I still can not believe we do not see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue participating, at least, in the zoo of Australia and in the discovery channel. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without some member of the Irwin family telling me how wonderful that crocodile is. Crikey!
