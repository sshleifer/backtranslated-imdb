The first time I saw this movie was when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was for sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers. This movie, however, scared me very much. You may be wondering, how could someone scare a movie about Santa Claus? The plot of the film revolves around Satan sending one of his henchmen, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa Claus and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa Claus. The field stalks Santa Claus along Christmas Eve in an attempt to trap him in the earth when the sun rises on Christmas Day, because if Papa does not return home to space, it becomes dust. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun and quite entertaining, however, the image of demons and demons dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is simply creepy.
