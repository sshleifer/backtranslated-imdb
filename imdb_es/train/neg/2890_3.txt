The past approaches a rehabilitation addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and ex-girlfriend after what he hopes to be his last stage in detoxification. "The dramas of life", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even writing has anything of value or ingenuity). The cast is made up of attractive-looking actors who smile sadly, and that the music and photography are dismal (some of the visual effects are laughable, indie-clich√© touches that reek of an insignificant budget). Although it was written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think this may be a distinctive reason why this image of two men, brothers separated ever closer, never gels at all , never feels natural or seems alive. It is an attempt to enter a male relationship, but careful and sterile presentation is a trap. Nobody's heart is in this, living, breathing or bleeding this material. "The Perfect Son" spreads quickly because of too many cooks in the kitchen.
