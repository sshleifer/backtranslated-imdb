Wow-this sucks. I will summarize it as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> An earl invites 4 naive foxes to his castle. A lot of nothing happens for a long time. Some soft and non-erotic soft-core sex scenes occur. Some girls cut their heads (off the screen) -The End. <br /> <br /> The only things in favor of this game are decent-looking outfits and costumes, some bad dubbing that leads to a fun dialogue unintentionally, and a few nudie shots. And believe me, those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that is this movie. In fact, the best part is the fact that the dealer has some slutty goth girls covered in blood and shows their tits, and once again, this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this crap. As everyone else has pointed out, the title of the film is completely absurd, since there is absolutely no bloodsucker or dances of any kind in the movie. It could also have been called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk', and at least then it would have had a better title that does not belong to anything in the movie either. An exact title would have been '90 minutes of torture ', another attractive title that at least would have been true ... for the viewer. Honestly, the trailer that is on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term 'best' extremely weak ...) so I strongly suggest that you look at it if you're still curious. I can not imagine someone who likes this wrecking of a movie; Please follow my advice and leave this on the shelf. 2/10
