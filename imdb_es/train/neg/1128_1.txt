This movie was one of the worst I've seen in my life. Pure nonsense How someone could develop a connection with heroin, or feel empathy for her, is beyond me. I felt I was looking at the history of a schizoid individual with a borderline personality disorder. Simply terrible. <br /> <br /> In his most generous view, this can be seen as an attempt to produce an "artistic" film, except that, for my life, I can not find any art in it. . <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in the world today, she would have been taken to a mental institution and given a couple of days of treatment with antipsychotic medication. That, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a woman bag. Why other characters in this movie found something that redeemed her, and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress, speaks more of her pathology than the convincing characteristics she had that made that effort worthwhile.
