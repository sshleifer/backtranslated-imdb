My wife and I are almost entertained by the Howie Mandel program ... I also like Shatner, even when he's at his most pathetic moment ... <br /> <br /> But this is the worst TV show. <br /> Please cancel this program. It stinks a **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are more attractive in this program and they seem to wear less clothes than Deal or no Deal ... <br /> <br /> The questions are a mix too easy and incredibly dark. And seeing Shatner or the contestant say "Show me the money" makes me want to throw up ... <br /> <br /> It will not last.
