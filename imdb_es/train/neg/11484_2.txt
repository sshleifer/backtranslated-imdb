Is it just me or is that child really annoying? <br /> <br /> The sister of Hideos, spends most of her time running after the little disobedient. As for him, well, I know he's a boy and everything, but his ability to act is almost as hard as a dead tree. So far I'm halfway there, and I'm fascinated by history, but the people who are in it, disappoint, I just hope it improves in the end, since I can not know what it is. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook, indicate that everything is upside down, ie, Dog is God, Live is Evil, etc. ... it just seems a bit obvious at the moment, but nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (Still, anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if you're reading this, then .. See the previous statement.
