This is unabashedly a futuristic adaptation of the "Mysterious Island" by Jules Verne. The sound editing is pretty bad. Listen to the dialogue on the set and listen to the voices recorded in a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston and shot in New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and who are reading this commentary, they will be captivated with a capital W. This movie is full of flaws. You get to hear the voice of the director who gives instructions and gives instructions to the actress. "OK, now stand up." As for the other characters. There is a guy who speaks with his mind instead of with his voice and this blue extraterrestrial. The alien type speaks with a deep voice. When you are yawning or growling when you are fighting, you hear the voice of the actor. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's initial job to shout out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is uneven. Really uneven Something like the animation of Karl Zeman in JOURNEY AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. The music is good. In conclusion, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF DINOSAURS look like an epic by Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and had a limited budget? A must for aspiring filmmakers.
