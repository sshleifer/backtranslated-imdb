With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been a constant disappointment since he succeeded with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> 'Land of plenty' is no exception. Considering the fact that I anticipated an average mediocre movie even before I entered, Wenders' ambitions seem to make the best of him. It is no longer clear if his films are heavy and grandiloquent. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that makes fun of Central America or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is totally predictable. Wender's insistence on combining many scenes with some rock songs is also very annoying. He was covering the gaps in his script and direction by animating the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonant, but honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of bad direction. <br /> <br /> Interesting that Wenders professed that by doing 'Paris Texas', he received a great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was the best thing about Wenders and I should understand that now he needs a good scriptwriter. His films of the last 15 years + were a total disaster.
