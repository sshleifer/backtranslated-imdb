IN AGREEMENT. I know that the John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this movie were quite low. <br /> <br /> Even so, after ignoring this shit, there's a key thing that I can 'It seems I'm coming out of my head: <br /> <br /> I sat through a movie of the 80 of Rob Lowe who had no nudity and only hints of sex in them. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, the characters boring and flat, the representation of Oxford as an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes are not exciting, without incident and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a bit of Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, there really is no reason to see this.
