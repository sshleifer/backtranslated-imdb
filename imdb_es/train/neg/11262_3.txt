Adrian has just left the asylum, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day, he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adri√°n search about his life and who his parents are. This is a film by a new director, and it's perfectly clear in most of the film: scenes not directed correctly, dialogs a bit forced, some incoherencies in the script ... Anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well , just A little) and that saves the movie a bit. The actors are known and of great quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; All of them have done better roles in another movie. The movie is boring and you will probably spend most of your time thinking about how much time will pass until it ends. Of course, there are many worse movies, but, of course, there are many better ones.
