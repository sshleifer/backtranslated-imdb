With this familiar attempt at blockbuster success "cheaper by the dozen" comes an unpleasant amount of cheesy dialogue, shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks. With about two good actors among many wanna-be's, this movie was a big disappointment. It is the ditto of a Hollywood aspiring of a plot already bad. So, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant they would probably be more forgiving. So the performance was not five stars. The plot moved pretty fast, and the turns were bad and they had a horrible time. The union of the characters and the "final relationships" were also too soft and clich√© for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
