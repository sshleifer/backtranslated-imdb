This movie is a self-indulgent garbage. Watch this movie if you only want to listen to the spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Be aware of any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be lovely but it's not, it's just irritating. The characters are difficult to care for and the acting is bad. The stories within the film are also without charm and sinister. I expected a moving family movie, but it was not attractive to my fourteen-year-old daughter either. It is rare that I can not see a movie until its conclusion, but it surpassed us both. <br /> <br /> Although the film is set in modern times, it has the appearance of a cheap East. European film made during the Cold War. There are not even enough landscapes and Scottish cinematography to redeem them. A real shame because as a film it is a shame for Scotland.
