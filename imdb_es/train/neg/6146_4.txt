How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K, I'll never know. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action film, full (or is it empty?) With fine plots like paper, stupid characters and absurd situations. But, if you enjoy watching poor but ridiculous movies, you will enjoy "Gymkata" a lot. <br /> <br /> The action focuses on a gymnast chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents to become a spy.) He will see that his father was another quasi-government agent, who has disappeared competing in This game, called, eloquently, "The Game." So the gymnast (played gently by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and discover what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising It's all right, but it's not like that, however, that plot of naked bones Sypnopsis does not begin to describe the joys of this film, it can be found in the strange details of the film, like the mysterious Asian girlfriend of the gymnast, he does not speak during the first half hour of the movie, then, suddenly, he starts talking, and he does not shut up for the rest of the time! Or the bad guy with the really hard shirt who likes to create and break the non-existent rules of "The Game" when so And, of course, there is the lovely game of our hero through "Village of The Crazies" (Obviously that's the real name of the place!). Good place to visit, but I would not like to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines are the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought that it was prudent to place gymnastics equipment in the alleys and squares of the cities of the Middle East, so that our gymkata teacher could use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil in parallel. Pummel bars and horses. Must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing to highlight. Very much, I would say that around half of the cast, dies to be shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only effects or credible actions throughout the film. If these were the effects, my main compliment note to the one who designed these very realistic arrows is the wound. Most likely, this was the movie's way of not paying extras. However, "Gymkata" is worth a look if you can see it without paying and is looking for some nonsense that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
