For a comic writer, Woody Allen really disappoints the viewer who pays with this meager attempt to develop the character. There are some entertaining moments, but no more than one would have heard your dryer drop tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell loses his time in this film, which fails to show his generally fun presentation. Amanda Peet did it well, but once again, I had no room to move in this movie that would otherwise be like a corpse. The movie is so heavy and boring that it can not be taken, but if it was taken away, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you like the movies that follow and continue in one scene and you really do not achieve anything other than to show that your writer can write some lines of quick dialogues from time to time, then you will love it. movie.
