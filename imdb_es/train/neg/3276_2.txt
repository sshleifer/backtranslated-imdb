The television show of the 1980s, updated with fresh and feminine meat, and obscene language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed by me; it was not repeated when he was in front of the television in New York or California; or, I probably would have seen it. However, from somewhere (like the clips that accompany the updated release of this movie in 2005), I knew it was a fast orange Dodge Charger, and "General Lee" is still running. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. The beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her small and bare well, but even her exciting pink bikini can not beat the competition from a bedroom full of bouncy and topless sofas. The overly stupid plot involves Burt Reynolds (as the "Chief" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazzard County into an open pit mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (07/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
