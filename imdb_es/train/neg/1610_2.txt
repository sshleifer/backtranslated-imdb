What I found so curious about this movie, I saw the full 4-hour version of roadshow, it's how strangely dispassionate it is. For a film about 2 very charismatic men, Castro and Che, engaged in a gigantic political struggle, is almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (which is, at best, a second-level actor, with a slightly high-pitched voice) have no drama or depth and, basically, they come to Castro to tell Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without any explanation about the effect or use of this action. Odder is still that there is an actor in the cast who has the necessary power to play Castro, Joaquim de Almeida, but he is sidelined in a minor part in the second half Without the tension or passion that would expect him to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a boring film of epic duration about hairy and bearded men running through various jungles screaming and firing without any purpose or purpose in particular. Several of the reviews I've read have filled me with praise about the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (In fact, one spent more time talking about the new digital cinema camera of Soderbergh than the plot or the actors or the fact that it is completely in Spanish with English subtitles). This is something strange and strange, since a) Soderbergh was just a contracted weapon. in the film and b) it is nothing more than a competent job, with a gesture of inconspicuous assent to Oliver Stone's JFK in black and white camera work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine the Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you would have an idea of ​​the boring competition of this movie.
