During a sleepless night, I was changing through the channels and found this shame of a movie. What were you thinking? <br /> <br /> If this is life after the "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this? paper? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I turned on the movie almost at the end, so I did not understand much of the plot. But this must have been the best part. This college nerd takes home this dominating girl ... this scene is taken from comics, or cheap porn movies. She calls the retentive anal mother and kisses the father "Oh, I did not expect the tongue!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> After this, I had to see how it ended ... <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a last hell, so the SWAT team is flat above. And yes ... they surround it! AND YES YES! The boy blows his brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is something you should see on television. <br /> <br />
