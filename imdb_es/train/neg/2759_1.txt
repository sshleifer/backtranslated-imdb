Hilarious, laugh noisy moments ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the gag planted with the ambulance soaking the "dirty tramp" who then shouts behind them in anger "disgusting vagabonds", I mean, wow, the online title of someone from literature is paying off! The worst script imaginable, with presentations of the plot in an instant, a ridiculous movement in history, the development of ZERO characters (even among the characters they meet ... it's as if everyone knew and trusted for years). Effects, and the holes of the plot ... oh God there are holes in the plot! To be honest, I write this without having seen the whole subject, but I certainly hope that the last 30 minutes or so does not exactly improve the already pathetic attempt at the cinema ... thank God, we have a good appearance that leads to doing something . let's forget that the movie is a load of ... well ... use your imagination to conclude that particular prayer!
