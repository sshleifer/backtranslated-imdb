This movie always left an impression on me. I saw him as a freshman in high school and that night he was alone at home. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor for being a big fan of "Brady Bunch." I also thought that the role of Chuck Connor was horrible and evil. However, this film impacted me so much that I am now a volunteer in the state women's prison that conducts Bible studies and religious services and tries to change the lives of women, one at a time. What fascinates me is that very few people actually saw this movie. None of my friends saw it and my family has no idea of ​​this day when I talk about this movie because they did not see it.
