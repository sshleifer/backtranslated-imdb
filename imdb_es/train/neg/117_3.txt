It was great to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They seemed quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I did not understand or care what the characters did. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and trusted their small parts of classmates. They showed some talent and it is sad that they have not continued to star in more and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the opportunity to act in this, her only important role in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans, and I had a very open attitude when I started watching it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest movie, "Cat's Meow" and all his first songs from "Objectives" to "Nickleodeon". Then, I was really surprised that I could barely stay awake watching this. <br /> <br /> It's ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a successful television series called "Moonlighting" that stole Bogdanovich's idea of ​​history. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was based on tons of witty dialogues, while this is about settling for slapstick and a few screwball lines. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: it's not "Paper Moon" and only a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
