Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to rate judges below 1. What a shame! This awful movie is so bad that I actually dismissed the damn thing long before the end. The script had some brilliant moments, but the direction, editing, acting, audio quality and, especially, the delivery time online was so abhorrent as to make the judges completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> The judges announced themselves as a modern Day of western comic style, but in reality it was nothing like that. What he likes most is dog poop on the bottom of his shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it's still stinking. <br /> <br /> Why do video stores think it's okay to carry this kind of garbage with constant gaps in the audio and worse than in the high school drama class? The acting is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than what is on television. But Judges is worse than the most pathetic original of SciFi Channel. I intend to claim my money back from Hollywood Video.
