John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in Indian territory, and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot in Utah, USA. UU <br /> <br /> An interesting western by its characters and its more modern environment, with Wayne & Dekker interpreting the old and new features of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis, who co-wrote the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the professional manner that corresponds to his career. A fairly mundane story is actually saved by its last third, where fortunately the action resumes and we are treated something like a pulse. The joyful approach to the romantic line does not look good, and a glorious fight between the two protagonists is ruined by the fact that Rogell can not disguise the doubles that do the job. But hey, tricks deserve their moment of glory forever. The solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne, as usual, has a lot of charisma on the screen, especially when he releases his gun. But despite its better-than-usual Republic budget, it remains a movie of interest only to Wayne enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4/10
