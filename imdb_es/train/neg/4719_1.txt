I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, breaks the necessary impartiality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people who interviewed, so you can not have an idea if they are worthy of being heard. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from a single point of view. Doing this is very dangerous, because the next generations learn the bad idea, and that is why wars keep coming. I know that this is not the only reason for the wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but read a lot on the internet before. The Balkans are complex as is human history.
