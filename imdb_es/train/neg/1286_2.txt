How does a Scottish love in a kilt make love in the beautiful purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now I have the clear advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four good legs and two bad legs", as Orwell had it. Jessica Lange has an accent that the production of "Brigadoon" by Wells - next - the - is Amateur Dramatic Society would reject. Liam Neeson, apparently popular among the ladies, wears her kilt with all the authority of a man whose great-grandmother got off the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the enemy of Auld? Where would the Scots be without them to hate them and blame them for everything? Messrs. Roth, Cox and Hurt should feel ashamed for falling into such a racist stereotype. "Robin Hood, the prince of thieves" seems like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
