The unbearably slow pace of this film was probably the director's expressed intention, in order to convey what life was like for a village teenager in China. However, it seemed to me that the combination of the glacially slow "plot" and the general filming style is so impersonal that it is totally alienating, particularly for a Western audience. Sometimes, I actually had trouble distinguishing some characters, since they were filmed from such a large distance. After two hours I had already passed completely affectionate. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very interested in the history and culture of China (and, by the way, is not alien to Chinese cinema), I could not get involved with just one character and I did not find anything that will help me understand it . Ask the question: if I did not like it, who would you like? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the job of any other Chinese director I've seen. This regrettable effort is simply not up to par. I would regret to see the Chinese cinema judged against this point of reference.
