If your idea of ​​entertainment is to see graphic images of people being hit by cars (you can see a woman going under the front wheel, twisting when the car passes over her before going under the rear wheel, and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time) then this is the documentary for you. I admit that I did not see more of this disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for TV channels to start showing luxury movies. Maybe the games based on self-mutilation could be nice. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen. I do not need to see the test on TV disguised as entertainment.
