Coincidentally I loved the show as it grew, along with millions of people. So I tuned into this movie, thinking that if it's not good, it could be at least a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> INCORRECT! I just have to ask myself, at the end of this, were Charlie's Angels really that boring? It seems I do not remember it as such. But this film, as bad as movies of this kind can be, was little like the emotion of that period of time and show. I saw everything, despite the negative aspects, it was not inadmissible. But it was very insipid, so I do not blame the artists, particularly the women who played the angels, since they really looked like them. The movie was not that interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is a fighter, one is the "good girl", another is her husband ...), all the characters were represented with a main characteristic that defines them and little beyond the stereotypes. The emotion of the show was missing and the dialogue was ... dialogue. This is a lot. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible. It's not the worst of television movies. But miserable
