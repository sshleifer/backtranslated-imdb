I have almost all of Seagal's films (yes, even those with a low budget), and I must say that this may be the worst, not only of his films, but of all the films that have been made. The only highlight of this movie, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also when plus takes A whole army with a knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and do not even bother with a story, because the story not only stunk, but so did the performance, the fact that the F-18 and F-14 of some way they became F-16s, and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also the Stealth never had to refuel ??? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force point of view. The last time I checked, Afghanistan does not have an Air Force, we (the US) control the skies. Also, this top-secret mission was played through speakers for the entire team in the room, but the Admiral still whispers to the other guy who is secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? Please, tell us why he was imprisoned. Since when are the great commands of Air Force pilots (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries, considering that Muslims do not drink alcohol? Also on top of that, since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like # 2 in charge? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
