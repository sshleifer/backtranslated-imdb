I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've seen in my life, since it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent film I've ever seen. Not once was a plot device presented without guessing more than 10 minutes in advance. There was no subtlety in anything the film did, no obvious intelligence behind the scenes. Every attempt at a spoken or typed line was so obvious that it was impossible to "get involved" in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the horribly planned plot, and the failed attempts to reclaim the audience. much more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
