This typically bolodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite with Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the performance is exaggerated and seems corny. The only reasons to see this telenovela are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the backdrop of the legendary Meena Kumari. Seeing the actress, who was ill during the shooting and committing suicide at the age of 40 years shortly after the movie premiere, has the same fascination as seeing a train crash. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competence to perform either task well. Bollywood has produced much better movies.
