I love low budget independent films and I had high hopes for this. But this movie is static. No matter the production value, which is very noble for your budget, but the pace is deadly. It is true that these people achieve a lot with little, but the film fails at the most fundamental level. It's boring. The edition is glacial and the rhythm stops. It should have been 65 minutes. Dr. Jekyll's best is Mr. Hyde, which is not seen enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to suffer through the Baltimorean-Brits stutter through an endless and exhausting exposure. It feels like a scenic game in a haven committed to the video. <br /> <br /> Noble efforts of everyone in the production, but such a tired story needed a kick in the pants and the new low-budget modern technology should have given it a new boost. voice. Instead, it's just a lame retread.
