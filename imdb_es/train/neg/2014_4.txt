I remember loving this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the best I had seen. It was ultra high tech for your time. It could repel enemy fire, do all kinds of stunts in the air and shoot down almost anything in its path. Now I come back and I see it today and I'm surprised how horrible this program is. The cast members are not convincing, there are many corny moments and the fight scenes are incredibly false. And almost all finals have the same helicopter battling garbage with the obvious reuse of low quality grainy stock footage. Many of the footage seems to date from the time of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider, except that the vehicle chosen to fight crime is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching some episodes, I found myself completely bored. However, I love the musical theme.
