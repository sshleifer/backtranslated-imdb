First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are continuously improving. From the tedious emotional films of the 70s and 80s, the films of this place began to contain a bit of humor. Imagine .. Real comedies were made! The films began to be entertaining and fun, instead of long, dark, depressing and boring. <br /> <br /> During the 90s and 00s, a "new generation" of filmmakers made several really cool films. Film after film were praised by critics and they played a lot of money. It became the norm! <br /> <br /> Then United came ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not even once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we are used to Norwegian movies being fun. Especially with a cast like this with some really funny comedians. But ... They do not say or do anything funny! Where's the humor Show me the humor! Is he the clumsy employee played by Harald Eia? Is the exaggeration totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Are Arne Scheie's comments? The movie is not funny! <br /> <br /> But that's not my main rant about United. That is predictability. (And it is here that I fear that the Norwegian comedies have stalled since I have also seen this in many other films). All the time, you just know that it will end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the film, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve at the end. There is no place for surprises at all! <br /> <br /> In general, I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the only movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in the making of films in Norway ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
