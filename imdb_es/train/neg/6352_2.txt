I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen and I always will be for most of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore the boring, meaningless, pretentious and, above all, horribly acted out this movie. An empty mental masturbation based on inconsistent motives. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate an alleged "clone of Allen", is to put in mouth and gestures to Will Farrell what Allen would have done in Farrell's place if he had been 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to mention the dialogues ... what pretended to be philosophical reflections became an involuntary mockery of intellectual reflection, without realizing its comic effect. How sad...
