Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in Little China", or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrible movies that have a certain coldness and a self-deprecating humor that turns them into cult sensations, The Golden Child It is simply bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not unfeasible, and there are some fun moments. But here the "flip attitude" of Eddy Murphy simply deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are foolish enough to cause more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are extravagant instead of forced. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake, or that the characters are facing real danger, why should we care? <br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - great Eddy Murphy fans who can not help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can not think of any other person <br /> <br /> I will give this movie 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
