This movie is just terrible. Poor John Savage had to duck to be in another movie. It stars a weird type of vampire who is helping a lady who looks like a prostitute washed and thrown on the street who is a dancer at a local strip club. She tastes like acid a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires when they crawl on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is assigned by a short leader of this rare race of vampires that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie goes crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a dwarf with a spider tattooed on his head, also one of the rare. Quote the elephant man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just got rediculas. And then, the most serious special effects they could have is that Corri vomits his organs and takes them out of his mouth. And you can say that that is all false. Your child does not know what to do with the new identity of his mother and becomes more a plague than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but I hated this one. Even the photograph stinks, coming and going is blurry with the camera changing in this way and trying to make it look like the vampires moved quickly for the camera to continue and then the camera turns bright in the scene of Savage chasing Corri's son around until he blinds himself. Avoid this one !!
