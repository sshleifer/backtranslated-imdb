Coyote Ugly could have been much more effective if the filmmakers had made it a guilty pleasure / exploitation film with R rating (very nudity). But since the PG-13 rating is what all studios want these days, end up with a movie like this: a PG-13 "mockery" movie that is not allowed to go as far as the movie should have gone. <br /> <br /> The script is as generic as it is It is easy to guess which point of the plot will occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so fine that you can not do anything with them. There were also many points where it seemed like I was watching a music video instead of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only advantages of the movie are the incredibly beautiful protagonists. We got to see them in some extremely tight suits and quite revealing ... but they could only show a lot because of the PG-13 restrictions. There's a lot of cleavage and toned and agitated bodies doing some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there's no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she becomes even more incredibly beautiful with age) is also in the movie for a very small time. The sexy newcomer, Piper Perabo, is also very good for the eyes (and has a murderous smile) and shows real acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this movie for is attractive to prepubescent children who are not allowed to watch R-rated movies yet. That audience can get a lot out of this in an aspect of excitement, but adult audiences will feel upset and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: the movie-1 the woman-10
