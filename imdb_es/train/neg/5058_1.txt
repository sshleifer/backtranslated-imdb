(When will I learn?) The ecstatic critic of NPR made me think that this turkey was another citizen Kane. Please, let me air my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I'll admit it: the stage, probably in New York City, has never been so ugly and unpleasant. They remind me that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles. And all the smoking! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, he succeeded. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there must be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty was close, and he could not wait for him to finish with Nicky. If a stray shot had hit Mikey, well, it could have caused a shrug of indifference at best. <br /> <br /> I can not remember when I detested a movie so strongly. I guess I'm a rub√© who does not dig "art" movies. Oh good.
