Have I seen a movie worse? Maybe only "Hands: The hands of fate" dragged more than "Dukes." I had more fun poking around in the gigantic holes of the plot than the film gave me at any time. Let's hit some ... <br /> <br /> There was a remarkable script of death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the dukes and they do not respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he's talking about (neither do we). It was as if the engine were shut off and restarted. <br /> <br /> The few times that General Lee flew through the air was not even that exciting. Nothing I have not seen in the television series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset with Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason why this works is that the script actually indicated it (although approximately). The rest of the time seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> The horrible and horrible accent of Seann William Scott (or his lack). <br /> <br /> I hated the performance of Willie Nelson. Were the bad jokes supposed to be attractive? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson appears splendidly on the big screen. She really felt like one of the best actors in the movie. That tells you how horrible this movie is. She is a God. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the film, I was encouraging Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten the entire county of Hazzard, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have sufficed. <br /> <br /> This is not intended to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly moving film. <br /> <br /> If only we could erase and start again ...
