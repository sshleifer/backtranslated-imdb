Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this terrible third sequel to "Honey I Shrunk the Kids," once fun and entertaining. The concept basically plays in the same way as the first movie, but with the adults instead of the cramped children and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The movie is boring at best, and in the worst case it's a shame. <br /> <br /> First, the continuity of the series was completely discharged into the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first film is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress who plays her wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, the ones who play the neighbors have changed ... whatever. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results are disconcerting to say the least. <br /> <br /> Second, the story is a rehash of the first, without a bit of originality. All the few jokes (and almost none) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I am sure that this has been done with a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, much worse than those that appear in the rest of the series. You're supposed to admire these small figures who explore the huge domestic area with amazement, but you'll probably end up shrinking most of the time. <br /> <br /> The fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is simply boring. Only a few things happen, and when they do happen, they are not exciting at all. The first movie was fun because the children dealt with nature, the grass and the insects that live in it. In this case, adults (who appear quite bored, compared to children) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​launching such a well-worn sequel to the already moribund series attracted Disney executives, except maybe because they needed money without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I warn you: leave this insipid waste in cash where it should be: pulling dust from the shelves of the store.
