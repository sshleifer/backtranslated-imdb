I was intrigued to see how an unseen movie from 2008 had somehow won the Oscar for the best film of 2009 and, therefore, I went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got during the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this movie had won prizes solely for off-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this film are some of the weakest. you will ever see when it is not occupied by being another tribute to the Bourne identity with nefarious and annoying images of "shaking camera", it shows all the hallmarks of a second-rate daytime soap opera in terms of lenses. <br /> <br /> The "plot" This characterization is as well developed as the rejected ideas of Beetle Bailey's comic strip, and dialogue, in cases where the film ceases to be "minimalist" and for no reason Apparently it turns one or two soldiers into correct charlatans, it is something of the worst ever recorded. To be fair, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, but not enough to hide how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has the feeling that it is thought of as a kind of "mockumentary" The time they spent was two hours in the movie. You will never spend two hours in this movie. come back, and two wasted hours that you will regret for the rest of your life.
