This is the Peter Falk movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already an expert in cinema at that time. Of course, neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads and the aura that it was an important film. Okay, 34 years later, I've finally seen the movie, I've never seen a movie directed by Cassavetes before. It's a hack, in general. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of the role of Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man": technically on par, but on a single note. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake from this movie. <br /> <br /> I was very annoyed by Gena's performance, I really thought it was more suitable for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all his fault: it's a case lost from the first to the last scene. We never find out why? But the character of Falk seems real and is WONDERFULLY interpreted by Falk as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> Shaving for at least an hour (an editor is needed!), And this would have been a surprising portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, a man who He faces a wife who does not work and can not cope with her three children and her husband's long hours of work. <br /> <br /> I 'prefer to remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he had taken his own tendency to excess, as amply demonstrated by this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
