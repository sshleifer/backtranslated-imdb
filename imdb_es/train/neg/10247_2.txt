This is one of the most boring movies I've seen, it's horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is not in that, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "The end of the world" is really a bad movie, I stopped seeing it near the end, it was so bad, only for fans of movie movies that have the brain to support this vomit.
