Hmmm ... where to start? How would an actress be like Demi Moore got involved in so much garbage? "First blood" can be qualified as bull *** t but this kind of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, period. Of course, if you're interested in the game story (Demi Moore just wants to show that a woman can be part of the Navy Seals) that is the stupidest clich√© I can imagine, you'll say "GI Jane" is a great movie . Only the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this film bearable, but hell, I can not imagine that Demi Moore is Rambo (especially not during the last 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make this film one for women with equal rights, it's just a brainless propaganda for the US military and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore. Horrible movie
