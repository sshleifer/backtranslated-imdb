Rating: 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> As this miniseries approached, and we were very aware of it during the last six months, while Sci-Fi Channel continued to water its shows with BG ads, I confess that I felt a growing restlessness as he learned more. <br /> <br /> As with any cinematographic work of art that has withstood the test of time, different people come to it to see different things. In this sense, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some it is the chrome warriors with the red light oscillating in their viewfinder. For others, it is the fondness they had for the special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget about the state of special effects in the late 70s, especially on television. For some the memories are resolved around the arc of the story. Others still remember the relationships of how relationships helped overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I come from this last group. The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people who came together to save each other from an evil empire. If evil The Cylons had nothing to gain, except the extermination of the human race, but they did. As the stars of the base revolved around, men and women united to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology, or more firepower. They survived because they cared and trusted each other to move on to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws and sometimes it was sad, but they were people who could interest you. <Br /> <br /> The writers of this current version seemed never to understand this. Somehow, he took the least significant part of the original program, the names of the characters and a version of the arc of the story and elaborated what they called nothing more than a reinvention of television science fiction. Since that was their goal, they can be judged by how well they did it: failure. It was far from being a reinvention. In fact, in many ways it was one of the most derived efforts of science fiction in a long time. It is borrowed from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I think it's unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has contributed to popular science fiction for more than a decade, and has contributed to some of the most popular sci-fi television shows you could hope to see. . One of the difficulties that it seems to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of Enterprise D & E. That was the inviolable rule of ST: TNG of Roddenberry. Like many who have lived under the rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned with the recognized science fiction teacher: Gene Roddenberry . Here, instead of writing the best possible story, he has created a dysfunctional cast as I have seen it with the intention of creating as much distribution conflict as he could. Besides being dysfunctional, some of that was not at all credible. Anyone who has been in military service knows that someone who hits non-violently a superior officer would not be left alone in a couple of days "hacked", could have been executed, and never would have left the next day. It would not have happened, period, especially in times of war. <br /> <br /> What I remembered from most of Ron Moore's previous work was that he was the one who wrote the death of Captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk and, unfortunately for me, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
