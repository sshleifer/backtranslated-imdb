The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a good red wine. This movie is not Cabarnet and it certainly is not Casablanca. I agree with the other critics that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that now lashes us every night in comedies and the dialogue is forced and preached. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> With the passage of more than sixty years of history, wisdom comes. From Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so-called real-life story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento." As one of the most obnoxious of the many US-based apologists of the USSR, it is obvious that his theme in the play and the film was to get the United States to take action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and the international communism of the fascists, who had just demonstrated their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one critic pointed out, this is not a pro-American play and movie, since Lillian went to her grave, a communist who hates Americans. This film narrates the familiar stupidity of the intellectual elites that formed the American Left at that time, just as now, the Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore have bought the conspiracy theories and once again have offered help and comfort to those who they would. destroy america
