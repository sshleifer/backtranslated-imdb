For all the flatterers who have been doing about Miike and his work. I sat through this movie tonight. I thought, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I suppose from these comments, maybe it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I did not have that luck. <br /> <br /> I am ready to find the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the chosen one. I do not have a Masters of Fine Arts from NYU, but I do know a lot: a horror movie has to have a rhythm. It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie made me shake my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so much that I went to the refrigerator and stayed there while Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera for a few minutes, eyes open and gaping. Once, a famous director made the claim, and to paraphrase, a film could be made by lighting the camera on a beautiful woman and letting her roll. Kou is not an actress good enough to make it work. She looks paralyzed at the girl not killed by more scenes than I care to remember. And she is not the only one who makes an imitation of a deer in the headlights; other members of the cast apparently feel the need to imitate this lack of action. The script gives them little space to do much more for too long. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. The Hong Kong action films of the last 30 years, the Korean horror as "Phone" and "Koma", the work of Ang Lee, some of the poor quality but fun Filipino movies with sex and free fights, as well as other . Chakushin Ari could have done it without him.
