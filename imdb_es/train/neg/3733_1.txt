Weak, rancid, tired, clich√©; he wants to be Basic Instinct, but he loses opportunity after opportunity for new perspectives, new perspectives. Tasteless, trite, grotesque and without the possible redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait ... it only lasted 90 minutes ... it must have * looked * much more! I prefer to clean the bathrooms of the bus station with my toothbrush than having to sit down again. I'm expressing an opinion here: I guess this means I did not like it.
