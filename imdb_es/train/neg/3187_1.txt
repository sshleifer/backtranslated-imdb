From the star of "MITCHELL", from the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are phrases that would normally prevent me from watching this movie. And the worst of all is that all the aforementioned statements are true. Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Bluff de Coogan"
