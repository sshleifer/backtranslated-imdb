As an engineer, I must say that the first season of this program started very promising. Most applied mathematics were somewhat plausible, and the relationships represented between the Eppes brothers and the father gave the program an interesting advantage. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the program began to degrade, to a large extent. Most of the mathematics and technology used in solving crimes are now incomprehensible and very ridiculous for all people involved in science and technology really. <br /> <br /> The participation of the actors still feels good and I can imagine a fair the amount of money that is still produced in each episode, but in the end, it has degraded to a plate of very unpleasant taste that is a mix of a grade C action thriller and a CSI-style copying program. <br /> <br /> If you're going to see it, only for the first season and possibly parts of the second. From then on I would not waste my time. Myself, I gave the program halfway through season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Let's add up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his mathematics anymore, I will not bother with my correction either.
