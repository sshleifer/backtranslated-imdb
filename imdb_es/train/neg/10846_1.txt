Not since Caligula I considered cutting the movie in half ... but then with this one, I only had 15 minutes when I considered it. Unfortunately, I made it to the end. Make sure you do not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or bloody or scary or scary or sexual. It is that it is none of those things, however, desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, trivial, ordinary, predictable and exceptionally poorly executed (filmed on video, special effects in high school, no sense of basic visual narration, barely audible dialogue ... it's not worth listening to). /> <br /> This movie is proof of the argument that even direct video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
