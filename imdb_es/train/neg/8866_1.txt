In theory, the 'Director's Comment' should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who narrates his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs in which he is said to have worked, are 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess of Duke Street' and 'The Bounder'. His comments are not at all informative, due to his habit of deviating from the subject. <br /> <br /> But in practice, he failed miserably. It's a joke show, and the joke is not particularly fun. The scripts are completely witless, and Bryden can not convince an old man. Whenever he gets stuck for something fun to say, which is like every five seconds, he emits a sibilant laugh. Instead of being fun for DeLane, you want to shoot him. If old seniles seem hilarious to you, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It did not help that the shows that were mocked were, with the exceptions of 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', pretty good. For the joke to work, they had to be really terrible, like 'Charlie's Angels', 'OTT', 'Addicted to Telly', 'Neighbors' and 'New Faces'. <br /> <br /> Time, so fortunately we save ourselves the horror of future editions. Would not it be deliciously ironic if the "Director's Commentary" were someday the subject of a parody?
