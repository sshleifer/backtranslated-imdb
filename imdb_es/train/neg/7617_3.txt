It's one of the worst movies I've seen, but the hostel is definitely much worse. This movie is more fun and ridiculous, than terrifying. I laughed most of the time when I saw it. Low quality effects (when you will see it, you will understand what I am talking about and HOW quality is LOW), bad actors (I hear them for the first time), and it seems that it was filmed by an amateur. camcorder (so it looks more like a television show, than a movie). But at least I had the patience to see it until the end. Do you like comedies? Look at it. You want horror. Go see Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about the Devil's Legend, I do not even know if I can classify it in a horror genre. Just a little bit of low budget garbage. <br /> <br /> I rate it 3 out of 10
