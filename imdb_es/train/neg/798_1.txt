Okay, the movie is good, but I give it a 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus turning into an organic virus is a pure fairytale. This type of garbage simply adds to the paranoid delusions of Moron, computer experts, that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First, the code strings and the dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer viruses. An organic virus is much more complex, although it is much smaller. However, it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic viruses attach to their cells and bind to RNA, then change their own RNA code. Explain how something like that could be processed from a monitor. Perhaps the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns the eyeballs in these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the writer did not think about that.
