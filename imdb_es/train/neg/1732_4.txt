Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so I'm happy to see any of their films. Basically, a man in a horned factory is the fourth to crack, and soon Ollie cracks with all the horn noises. He is resting at home with Stan at his side, needs silence, and the phones of the Doctor (James Finlayson) to say that he is going to visit Ollie. After realizing that the plumbing and electricity are mistaken for a cross-eyed repairman, the Doctor goes for a check-up and, after some tests, recommends drinking goat's milk and taking some ocean air in the ocean. After Stan practices a little trumpet, hanging by the window next to the telephone wire and a car accident, he and Ollie go to a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat, and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the cover of the newspaper reads that the murderer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and sneaks into the children's boat while they sleep, and the goat chews the boat's rope and throws himself into the boat. sea. In the morning, they see your location, and the Assassin comes out asking for something to eat, and sees Stan and Ollie making fake food, for example. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie begins to suffocate with something, Stan plays the trumpet to help, and Ollie's rage makes him hit the killer, and continues until the police arrive, only to have Ollie's rage also put them in jail. There were the smallest moments of comedy, but it's not a big black and white movie. "Well, here's another good mess you've got me in!" It was number 60 in 100 years, 100 citations, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 in The Comedians' Comedian. Good!
