The reward is the game that is being played in this drama and the plot of revenge is undone by the absurd plot that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why would a man get involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mafia boss in the gangster mansion with suspicious henchmen everywhere? Why would an unhappy woman encourage the attention of a complete stranger and expect him to take her with him and leave her husband behind and boredom to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband who gives the film an excuse to indulge in senseless violence and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he was, surely deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly when he clings to his prince charming. Stowe is fine, but his Spanish accent does not work. The cameos of the minor players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
