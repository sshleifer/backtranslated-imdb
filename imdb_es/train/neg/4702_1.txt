I hate this movie I hate the show. I hate almost everything about that. It is so annoying and stupid. they all say that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the world of music and that they will make it great. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex are going to end up as hobos or Jane Hudson from "What happened to Baby Jane?" I could only spend 20 minutes of this, barely 30 seconds of the program, and I managed to survive approximately half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How could anyone cheer these guys up in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. Days before Nick's movie premiere, most of Nick's teenage actresses (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in a commercial with brain-dead children about how amazing are nat and alex wolff. First of all, they did not fool me, and secondly, nat and alex probably drugged them or paid them a lot of money to say that and sound convincing, because I do not see how anyone could find this program / movie entertaining. the music is horrible. The song of nat sounds like a sick and dying elk on a crack. Alex is the most annoying character in the movie / TV series. It's not funny, it's annoying, it's really weird, and he thinks he's sexy and he knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he ever manages to have sex. You know that this show is fake when you discover that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin, Jesse Draper (they must have had some budgetary problems). His father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the program, so it seems that the Wolff do not have a mother. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I will tell you that the Naked Brothers will be in a deep situation when their "fanatics" discover that everything is organized. 0/10
