The problem with this movie is that it is filmed in the worst possible camera and the film is blurred and grainy. Maybe it's the fact that whoever held the camera could not sit still because he was suffering an attack or something. There is also too much poop and vomit in this movie. There is someone who vomits every twenty minutes and makes me think that this was done by some bulimic or something. That was disgusting. Then there is the annoying high-pitched scream that goes on and on and on and does not stop until the credits accumulate. I also did not like it when they shot all their friends (or not, I do not know) and she gets into the truck and puts on her headphones. That was really really stupid to even have that in a movie. How much gas can a person take out to start a truck? It must be a lot because they do not run out of fuel for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I would strongly suggest never seeing it in your whole life.
