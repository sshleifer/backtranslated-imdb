I like Jane Austin's novels. I love the books and movies of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I gave up with the book after 2 chapters, and at the end of the movie I could not care less about Emma. She did not seem to change at all. Maybe it was the performance of Paltrows (which is excellent on Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. I dont know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are beautiful, but the dance was awkward compared to the Pride and Prejudice dance of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 basically because of the fact that Knightly is Bloody beautiful, and even though it was a rather erratic performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing.
