I've seen many original Sci-Fi Channel movies since I started watching them in 2002 (my first was Sabretooth, which is actually one of the most entertaining features of Sci-Fi Channel in my opinion). Its quality varies. Some of them are normal but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and there are some that are truly terrible. The raptor planet is found in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a sequel to the original Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island, is a mess of a movie that can hardly be seen with a truly awful performance and lazy writing. The effects that make dinosaurs come alive (a combination of puppetry and animatronics, as well as CGI and footage from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst-looking effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. Gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a group of commandos who for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That's the way people are, dinosaurs are extraterrestrials. Dinosaurs in outer space. What's next, sharks in space? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast is collected and eaten. We've already come to expect this in the many movies and dinosaur novels that are released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've seen where I really got bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There is some laughter in it though. There is a scene that stands out in which a Carnotaur is massacring a man (brought to life by the archive images of the original film) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor. Also, a little curious, this is the scene in which Steven Baur is filming his own scene of the death of the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie to start with, it's a masterpiece compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say that this is possibly the worst movie. Syfy has ever been aired. It is close to a clock.
