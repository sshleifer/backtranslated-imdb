This movie starts by presenting an original idea, but then it became a great frustration. What is the deal to have an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clich√© plot? The movie itself is very incredible. I would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic, puts on a nursing suit, kills a doctor, takes a patient out of bed, puts on his Chevy truck and leaves. I guess nobody could answer this question, so they jumped to the other scene hiding these little details. The performances are simply bad. The villain is just another "crazy and annoying antagonist", he has no depth, he is a totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are incredible, it seemed that they were put there just for the good of the 90 minutes, since they were totally unnecessary. A doctor sees a woman clearly under heavy medication, is denied examination, is expelled from the home, and simply goes quietly? The final scene blew me up in laughter, only Mickey Mouse could do it more out of reality. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first one, let's say 10 minutes of film.
