Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was thrilled when I bought my ticket to Syriana. After having seen the trailer and being passionate about thrillers, I expected to see, first of all, a film that moves fast and that catches the breath, that is submerged wisely in the formulation of global policies and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, from a new angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, the interlaced edition made the understanding of logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you do not care. Save money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
