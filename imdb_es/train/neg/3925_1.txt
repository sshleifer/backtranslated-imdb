I saw this "hot" movie when it went on sale in 1986. I had an X rating for a short scene that involved oral sex, but it was presented in traditional theaters (it was an "artistic" movie). Supposedly it is the first movie that shows a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman (Maruschka Detectors). As mentioned before, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body BUT also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) quite poor. No wonder I've never made another movie. Still, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but quite brief), this is a boring and slow story that bored me stupidly. The good performance of Detmers only helped to a certain extent. Mainly I was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end. If I did not have that sequence, this movie would have been forgotten a long time ago. Bored and slow. You can omit this.
