In my opinion, this is almost the perfect example of the Hollywood ego, second only to the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears socks. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the beginning of the movie you just want to put a piece of kryptonite in his throat. He looks just plain silly wearing the disguise. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for lois lane, she's supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he is actually a superman son, who would have ever thought ...) and the performance was horrible. This movie has something good, and his name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save this movie. What this film needed was the cast of "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey, of course) and a different story. I saw this movie after seeing "Hills have eyes" and I was surprised to know that there were films worse than that.
