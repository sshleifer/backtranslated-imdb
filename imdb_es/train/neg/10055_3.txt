I grew up in the theatrical version 'Superman II' ("S2T") and when I was a kid, I loved it more than in Part I, since it not only contained more Superman and three Superman-type villains, did it start with a bang? ? The best transformations from Clark Kent to Superman and rescue scenes. The children no longer had to wait impatiently for Superman to appear on the screen, as in part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how the powerful had fallen with the S2T (See: my review). I've always heard about the back. story about how they dismissed the original director, Richard Donner, from the second part prematurely and unjustifiably. (It must have been a rarity at that time to film two separate films simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the future' and 'Matrix' 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD") ") I still can not recommend it completely. Gone was the great change scene of Superman, all the rescue of Paris, as well as the wonderful summary of the first part of the opening of S2T. In fact, they all wrote the words: "Previously on Superman?" in S2RD. The special effects were not very good either in Part I or in the S2T, but S2RD, were they almost totally ridiculous? like Lois falling from the window of the Daily Planet. I admit that some new scenes worked and some that came out were welcome to outings, like any scene in the "honeymoon suite". In general, if you grew up in S2T like I did, and you loved it when I was a kid? Not being as discreet as I do in adulthood, you should see S2RD as it is almost a new children's experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change is the last: it was the strange amnesia kiss of the S2T replaced with the same ending as 'I'. This is not just a lazy, not original copout, it does not make sense why Clark would come back to that restaurant, if those events never really happened. And will "time going back" continue for each confrontation?
