Times are hard for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for almost unknown reasons (mainly due to shameful writing) the gangs want Martine to join the gangs, so they hit him every day. However, due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier, "the weakest actor in the world" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message films ever made (and I've seen my part) that seems to consist of the idea that all neighborhoods infested with gangs need, are French kick-boxers who can not act. Worst of all, there are so many uncomfortable moments that are truly fun. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which basically sums up how ridiculous this is. For Wit: "Do you like the fight?" (Olivier grabs his best Asian friend in a key) Could I kill him, right? When I want him dead, he dies! The reason I do not want him dead is because I'm scared of him, and I know that if I kill him, his son and his wife will kill me, that's why he does not die! <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that it is wrong to kill someone, let alone Your best friend, of course, is out of the equation Strange. <br /> <br /> However, do not let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it is so terrible that it has no price. The biggest laughs come to an end in the disastrous finale that sees Grunner confronting the gang members one by one who (the biggest logical breach in the film) reject the use of guns, and a handicapped Vietnam veteran helps by firing his machine gun at gangs, while Gruner kicks the rest, all this fits the sound of the horrible accents "mexi canos "and the surrealistic energy that make it memorable for movie garbage fans like this one. <br /> <br /> The other whim of this movie is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college even though it's the main reason he's here in the United States and not in France to do it with his girlfriend (In a cemetery in the awkward beginning of the movie) Angel Town is definitely a failure at every level imaginable, but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with foolish action levels that make no sense at any level, This is the perfect movie for you.
