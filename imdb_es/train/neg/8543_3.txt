I admit that I had to move quickly through this badly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes: NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot". But, has anyone mentioned the opening scene? A butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and impaled on the grass in the front yard! I suppose the spoiled child did it, but he never explained it to him. The really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I wish this was a better written or thought movie, because what we have left is quite silly and a movie that does not make sense is not an "intelligent" movie, it's just a poorly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a clean version and if any images were missing, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a weird little movie that's better if you move fast!
