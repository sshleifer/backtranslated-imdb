... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire aspect of "Hood Life", you're in the wrong place too. If you're looking for a laugh movie, this is a real winner! The performance is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the official investigating the drive-by. I can say that he also made the voice for the 911 operator by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear about a cardboard box, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" made their best snake impression that is on par with their overall FANTASTIC performance (note the sarcasm ... HOW DID NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR THE BEST MAKEUP) Quiroz ...? We do not do any type of address. I felt like I was watching a piece of the improvisation period (the period is more like the 1990s in Los Angeles). However, the direction is one of the worst in the script that I think has ever graced a movie. I have not heard such beautiful lines, like the epic that begins with the movie "F ** k!", From Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. This only works, of course, along with the epic hip-hop soundtrack too! All 3 or more songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with every intention of laughing in every scene, and what it was and what it did! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to meet with a group of guys and laugh at a low budget horror movie (yes, yes ...) at night. A memorable experience for sure!
