If you can believe it, * another * group of teenagers returns to * another * lakeside cabin three years later * another * one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of them. Low and look, a psychopath wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap one like paper) is wasted one by one.

A last second turn does little to encourage the spirits, and the "Day of the Fallen" is something that is best thrown into a lake and forgotten. One only for crazy collectors.
