I entered this film with a lot of desire to align it. I thought the premise had great potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was taking this for the B movie that is. That said, it still did not meet expectations. The historical aspect of the story is glassy and the end left me a bit cold. The performance in the movie was very wooden. In general, I give it 4 for a great idea, but the film could have had a much higher score with a little more attention to the basics of the movie. Worth seeing? I did not want my two hours back, but I do not know if I would recommend it to others.
