The best thing about field films in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a soap opera during the day or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the plot, identify the cardboard characters and observe with satisfaction while all the clich√©s are fulfilled. However, sometimes, the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, something strange or something perceptive. Director Makinen is up with the best camp directors, and this is his best movie. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to be fine. There is nothing good about it, but it still manages to be a coherent whole. The film does not slow down even once. The action flows and the blows keep coming. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while others have only spent an hour in a bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day becoming a night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a plot, there, somewhere. However, you may have to watch the movie three times before you know it.
