"Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but it's more like it was edited from the rejections of those two films. Fortunately, I rented it for a 5 day rental because I could not sit down and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I liked the scenes in which other types are covered automatically. The missteps of Paul (the checker in Save-mart was great) but the writing of scripts is absolutely horrible. Most of the time, the dialogue is deflated and, just when you think things are finally going to get going, it is not necessary to have an unnecessary eye gag. Also, how many toilet jokes does a movie really need? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it's done elegantly like in the other movies I mentioned, but this movie simply loses its mark. Too bad I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you was great) but even that could not help me review this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent "There's something about Mary" once again.
