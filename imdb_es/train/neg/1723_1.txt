Man, what a scam this turned out to be! Not because it did not help (since I did not expect anything from that), but because I was fooled by the DVD case that, in an ignorant way, showed its "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Indeed, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the film, much less the rest of them! As it turned out, the only film that connects these three actors is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975). But what one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is what nobody knows? <br /> <br /> Even so, since I paid $ 1.50 for their rent and anyway I was in a monstrous movie environment, I chose to watch the movie in spite of everything, and yes, it stunk! Apart from the fact that I had an unnamed cast and an anonymous crew, I could see from the distance an unmistakably amateurish air and the most I could do was laugh at the claims of JAWS and, intentionally, the resistance. clowning of two crazy moray gobs, owners of boats that often fight each other with the baffled local sheriff watching. The creature itself? a plesiosaurus that is, half dinosaur / half fish? it's done imperfectly (naturally) but, as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW (1957) that I also just saw, this did not seem to bother the filmmakers any, as they flaunt everything they can, especially during the second half of the movie!
