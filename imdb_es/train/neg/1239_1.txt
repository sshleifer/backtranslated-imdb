Being a big fan of the "other" films PLANET OF THE APES, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to Tim Burton. Once again, it does not stop disappointing with its boring address. Even the makeup of the apes seems second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg demonstrates once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I felt embarrassed by genuine talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Undoubtedly, their salary checks motivated them, since it could not have been the clich√© script. I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel cheated.
