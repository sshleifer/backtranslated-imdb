I really did not expect much from this movie, since it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is where I live, acting in it. This city is boring and this movie too. There were some decent people in the movie, but I was distracted by all the reference points that made a point to show. This movie may have been good if there was a real performance in it but there was none. Unless you're from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see every day, get away from this movie. The dialogue will put you to sleep, the performance will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting things like this. It is a predictable movie without surprises. What you see is what you get and that's a 73 minute walk through Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a storyteller.
