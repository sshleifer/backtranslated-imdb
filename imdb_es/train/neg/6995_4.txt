It's funny how many of the people who say that this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other publications). What we have here is a 2-hour MTV video full of action, full of action, bloody and "Whoopee". Frantic editing, pop video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total mess) ... pretty well acting All round, totally predictable in the "who will die next" bets and a total of cash in the name of Dawn Of The Dead that will generate a lot of income only for the fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity. .. <br /> <br /> Do remakes of classics not make you nervous? Can they REALLY not come up with something original? Why redo Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment that kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted and are still not happy) they are totally gone. This is an action movie, simple and simple. The faster, the better. If you like action movies (and like this, the 2004 version is well done) pretty well, but for anyone who likes a little substance in their movies ... get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> Watch the theaters for years to come as The Godfather series is remade by whomever is the most modern pop director at the moment, and Star Wars is remade, with all the children saying that the new version is much better than the old version The version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the Romero's version, not this version.
