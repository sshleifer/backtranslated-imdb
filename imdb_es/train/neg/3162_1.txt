I did not even bother to finish the movie because I was so bored that I thought I was going to faint. I was watching it in movie theaters and my friends and I got tired, so we got up and went to another movie if you ever have to sit through 2 min. From that movie again, I think I'm going to shoot ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I was not surprised at all, I mean who did not know her. I was going to do the right thing and let him be happy, I really want to say that you would have to be a complete idiot not to know. I know I did not miss anything and if someone asks me to watch that movie, I would say "about my body".
