The performances of Fishbourne (which somehow looks oddly funny) and (with a brief introduction) Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery, who does not seem to make sense in his role and ends in the motor behavior of a man of 80 years. In fact, the script does not make sense; Imagine a 60 min. final happy argument plus a sudden spin appendix without any plot structure with respect to the characters. It is more an accident than a script and may be good for exam purposes in the screen-wrights schools. The more you remember the details, the stronger this impression becomes. Capital punishment is not a problem here, although it is a topic from the beginning; It vanishes without further comment. The subject and the environment could have been good.
