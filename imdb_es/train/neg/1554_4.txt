Cannon brought out a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems fascinating (except for the pillar of the dragon). Now, how is it that the old studio known for the films of Chuck Norris never had a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: the amateur performance and the horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is not a cure for a terrible execution. In fact, they continued and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of lusty bimbos, just to make it look even better. For the two "barbarian brothers", they know how to make strange noises that become brave warriors, so strong and bold enough to save their homeland. This is the biggest waste of potential I've seen in a "low cost" movie, and worse enough to let an ax hit the beautiful impression without mercy. All this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! The movie alone makes a great memory!
