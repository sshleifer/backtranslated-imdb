Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, it would have been better if all the characters had been attacked in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need him? Although it is as depressing as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and a nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not as entertaining as any of the gloomy films mentioned above. While free cannibalism can make aspiring hearts of Jeffery Dalmers run a little faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Actually, I found it as interesting as the nightly infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for anyone. I was really surprised that this was not done by the people in Brain Damage since that was the quality of Dead Creatures.
