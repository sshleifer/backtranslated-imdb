I saw this movie at 3:00 in the morning, an hour of the day in which I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But even so I think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons why there are many are. <br /> <br /> The acting is not so good, and again and again the situations that occur in it remind me of a poor comedy Chevy Chase of the 90s. I mean, come on, like the situation of the wives and the poker situation among the servants ... This movie was obviously so based on the first, and that's fine. But if I had not seen the first before seeing this, it would have been even worse. Like the ending, it arrived very suddenly, and I felt that it did not have any kind of closure ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this movie seems to have been made solely to explain nr 1, and as there was no time or effort. Used to do any other good thing. The score is the same as in the first one, and it did not look like a movie ... <br /> <br /> They should have handled situations with more style and class, but they did not. , and therefore, this movie turned out badly ...
