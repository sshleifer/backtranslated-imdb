Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: it's me or every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico stinks. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with all the things of On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the scene in the classroom of Raiders of the Lost Ark and a shot in a small Stargate to boot. <br /> <br /> Derivative does not even begin to describe this movie. Of course, with none of the original plot I knew they amplify blood and sex, right? Nope Gore is a blink of an eye and you miss out on business and sex is all jokes. (James Spader causally mentions that he needs a shower and the delightful Leslie Stefanson asks him to join him, he rejects her AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if a movie ever needed a Shower scene to liven things up. even this is everything. I mean, if you're going to have incredibly pretty women in white swimsuits wandering around a research base in Antarctica, why not go for a break. <br /> <br /> With approximately 30 seconds of real emotion throughout the movie Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow for a science fiction adventure. I needed a better plot twist to cheer him up and, by the way, the Alien itself is a horribly clich√© artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked during the visualization of what happens with the children of the corn in the space motif. (Note that since Jason on Friday the 13th, Pinhead from Hellraiser and Leprechaun have traveled to space to kill nubile teenagers, why not the corn field?) The characters in the corn field dress up as Logan's extras Run and I was waiting for the stems to come alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> However, that would have been exciting and apparently against this cinematic pact. The performance is mostly good, as Spader takes up his role in Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch, however, read the entire script and behaves like an evil madman before history tells. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative trick that makes me crave corn children.
