As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music, the graphics and the created world are magnificent and really stand out from most of the other modern animation works. However, if you are looking for more than this, I suggest you look elsewhere. Beauty does not reach its appearance, and when it really is about plot and characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal, and people are flat, cheesy at times and do not act realistically. Not to mention the hole in the plot here and the hole in the plot ... So, in short, my God, I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my God, it's like ... -poke- people do not act like that. He took a GIANT step in graphics and music in anime, but he also took a step back in times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there is not so much action to compensate for that ...
