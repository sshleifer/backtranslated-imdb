This is a pretty boring movie about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and is horribly disfigured when using the machine to transport himself. Simple plot made before in the fly and others. Not only is it disfigured, but it can also electrocute people with a touch. What is really silly about this movie is that we are expected to believe that the place where this guy works is against him. He could probably make millions for the institution he is working on, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. In the end, the projected man electrocuted three people for no reason and then pursued those who hurt him.
