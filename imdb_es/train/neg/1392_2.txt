"Gray Matter", also known as "The Brain Machine", but the video people thought it better; the screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977; It's that kind of movie. The government has some primary interest in this "brain machine" project that has recruited four people, who turn out to be, approximately, a philosopher, a cornered priest, a veteran of the force and a patriot who became a abortion a room that contracts with a computer that can read your horrendous secret thoughts. In the end, the government takes the laboratory by force and everyone dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in all important aspects; MI s *** has better production values ​​than this. However, I kept my interest just to see what exactly these filmmakers thought of the exploitation they were doing, entering the drama of the character of four boys in a room. The answer: a treatise on how science is inferior to God. Thank you. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, the philosopher by Gerald "the Republican Simon" McRaney. Also with transition shots and establishment very, very, very long, in large quantity, this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention.
