At least I could enjoy making fun of the movie, which is surprising since I could barely sit through it. Honestly, my guess is that the cover of the DVD case costs more than the entire film. And saying he's the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of that came out ... nice touch boys, he was deceiving enough to tie me up. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable performance of the imitator was his haircut. Usually, you only see that type of hair in a ten-year-old child and the character behaves as such. It seems that the film was filmed by a graduate student in D + of a film school who was enthusiastic about the use of all the cinematographic techniques he learned while attending classes ... sometimes, less is friendlier. Throughout I was lost by random twists of the plot that led nowhere or were inexplicable. All this makes a bad movie, but when the end is not even close to putting it together, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. Undoubtedly, this is the worst movie I've seen in my life, and that includes the final French video of my friends for the last year of high school, but I hope it is a little skewed, I mean I could play an extra . PS I do not even think that this deserves a star ... not even half. NONE FOR YOU !!
