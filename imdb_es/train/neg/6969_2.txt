Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers", as it is known here in the United Kingdom, was a rather boring horror movie about an old man who is bitten in a greenhouse by a mysterious toxic plant. The man is taken to the hospital, where this worm like a creature comes out of his mouth, of course, this transforms into this monster of insects and proceeds to go to the uproar! Even though Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the film, I found it boring, with a predictable story, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action. The terror fans do not need to track this rare movie, you will not lose much, trust me! I give this movie 2/10.
