After hearing a lot about the Cracker series of the 90s without seeing any of them, I was waiting impatiently for him. Surely the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversies, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overwhelming. The production tried to be super modern, but the blinking boxes and even the children's fountain were irritated. Robbie Coltrane walked for two hours, presenting unexplainable and improbable "ideas," and the police were presented as one-dimensional idiots. As a result, the tension never increased and the scene from the next to the final (without details for fear of spoilers) was a piece of television drama as ridiculously bad as I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see more of these, but I'll go back to the DVDs of the 90s series to see if they match your reputation.
