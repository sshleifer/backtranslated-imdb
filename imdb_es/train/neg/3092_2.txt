If movies like Ghoulies steal the Gremlins, then the Hobgoblins sink to the new minimum of cheating in the trash like the Ghoulies. These barely animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill the fantasies (which involve the sexual dreams of the characters basically grotesque, oh joy), but what has to do with anything is what anyone can suppose, except to let the Director gets carried away by his addiction to erotica. . They show it in the eighth circle of hell, one suspects. There is no real plot, only "goblins - kill!" Weak attempts at humor and a slight attempt to awaken the audience.
