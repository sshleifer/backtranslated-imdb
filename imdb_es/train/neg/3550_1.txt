I lead a group to stop the exploitation of comedians and spent the last 2 months listening to horror stories of comedians who tried to audition for "Last Comic Standing". If they do not have a GOOD agent, then they do not even have the chance to audition, so more than 80% of the comedians who show up are rejected before they can show someone they have talent! If they arrive at an audition, they told me that they are "predetermined" if they have a second chance. So, what the television audience sees is NOT the best comic in the United States. <br /> <br /> If the comics arrive to the program, most of them do not obtain credits of IMDb. I know because I made the credits for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and they do not pay me to do the work of the Producers. It is really a disgrace. A month ago, I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why the Producers are not granting IMDb credits and they expelled me from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have a personal interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see anyone exploded and that's why I've been helping comedians. The comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a GREAT THREE network, so those responsible should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to occur. <br /> <br /> Watch this video of the comedian who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
