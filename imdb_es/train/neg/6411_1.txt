The Return is one of those films for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame businesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all during the movie. He was willing to endure this, however, he was not willing to endure the worst edition ever combined with meaningless flashbacks. In the end, it turns out that she crashes her car against herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. With this movie it is impossible to say. Can you believe that the same guy that Army of Darkness did produced this shit? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on the science fiction channel. That movie had it all: whores, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw by his arm. The Forgotten did not even have one of these things.
