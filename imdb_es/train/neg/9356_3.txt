Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death: the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this little bit: SUNNY (1930). She is quite poor as much as an early talker and as an attempt at a musical, although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? AND ONE MAN SOLING). The rest of the score, including the melody of the title, is discarded, although we can hear the latter in the background score. Miller looks overweight and amateur here, without any star quality. Even his dance is subtle. The film is very badly written, full of old jokes and without grace and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as an interpreter, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
