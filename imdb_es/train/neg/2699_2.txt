I have not read a single IMDb comment for this movie that mentions how the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby, while a racist head points his gun at a face while the black lead character of the film is seen severely. by the barrel of a gun. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone would perceive this as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance as they are supposed to be and the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make his characters such large cartoons. <br /> <br /> On the surface, try to represent the Ice Cube character. as a bad boy, causing Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduates at the end in the redemptive epilogue of the film? It seems that Singleton points out that white is unable to empathize (I did not say sympathy!) With his black student partner OR he can only take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been harassed by people of another race do not resort to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is described more as a cult than as a lifestyle. Honestly, what was the point?
