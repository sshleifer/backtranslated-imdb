Pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely loses the sense of the musical, "opens" it unnecessarily and dirties the thrust of the work. The show is about a group of dancers who test for a job in a B'way musical and examine their motivation and desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work. Attenborough offers us a cast of fresh-faced hopefuls, assuming they are trying to get their "big shot" in the entertainment world, instead of presenting the most enjoyable mix of characters created on stage as a group of "gypsies" who they live. , along with a couple of newcomers. The film has an advantage over the work and it is the opening scene, which shows the size of the original hearing and the true scale of contraction until 16/17 on the line (depending on how you tell Cassie, who is stupidly removed from the line in the movie). Anyone who can capture the local production of light civic opera will have a much richer experience than watching this ill-conceived film.
