When people ask me what is the worst movie I've seen, it's this one. It is not even close to the MST3k burst level, or the midnight display in a theater, or even as the filling of the Disney channel late at night. The only time I wanted to jump out of a ride at Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the mannequin, tear it to pieces and ram it into the throat guide. "Eat this! Eat this impious layer of darkness!" I've never been so angry with a movie, not even with "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Do you want beautiful colors and cinematography? I'm not here, baby. Critics keep saying "oh, but it also looks like a comic", well, for me, it's the color of a Gordito after several weeks under the sun. The most pleasant too. Beatty wanders through this landscape jumping and talking with his watch, himself, and occasionally with the other actors, waiting for someone to tell him what time the filming of the sequel will begin. To be fair, I've only seen this movie once, but my threshold of pain is that of a man, not a God.
