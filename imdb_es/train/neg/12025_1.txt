This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a silly movie from the 80s that would be nice at some level, so my brother and I saw it. Chico made him suck. The boy falls in love with the girl - correction, his * dream * - girl (apparently there is a difference, and I am surprised that he realized that she was the girl of his dreams), he was beaten with her from more than 30 feet away. I guess it only serves to show the power of the girls dreamed), the child ends up disguising himself as a woman to be near the dreamy girl (creative in the sense that it is a distant plan, but not creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions that one might think), awkward situations occur, a pairing is made (all of which seems to take place late in the afternoon, whether the place was responsible for this strange illumination, or the actors had to wait until they got off their day jobs to come to the set, I suspect the latter). Very awkwardly done, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * accidentally, so there's really nothing to trade. Unless you're interested in seeing the early days of Chad Lowe, before he finally got his share of the pie with his role as gay man with HIV in the "Life Goes On" series, or Gail O'Grady, who was in the New York police. and I could probably stare at the buttocks of Dennis Franz). But those are implausible reasons, I would say that the "systematic disorder of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised you've seen it all. I guess it's the kind of thing in which, halfway, you find yourself * still * observing because of some morbid and self-flagellating internal problem, and you think you could finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you really sat down through such a horrible movie, on the off chance that it brings him some sympathy for the questionable state of his mental health. Can * you * take the challenge?
