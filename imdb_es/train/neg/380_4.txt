I wonder if there is any sense in this movie. It is a great joke. Well ... it's entertaining ... You can see the most stupid argument played very seriously in the form of a movie ... I wonder what group of audiences this movie is basically aimed at. <br /> <br /> Priety (a professional) plays a surrogate mother for a happy couple, Salman / Rani, who wants a child but can not. I wonder what it would be like if this drama were a real life takeoff from the life of a real couple. <br /> <br /> Rani seems to be happy with another beautiful lady in her house who has been brought in to be a child for her and Salman. She worries about Priety and tries to take her husband Salman to Preity so they can have a bit of romance. When will the audience of Salman's nakhras get tired? <br /> <br /> Although it is a good pastime, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
