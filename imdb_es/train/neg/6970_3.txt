Now, it would be a kind of clich√© if I started with the title part, so I'll wait for that. First, this movie made me wonder why children do stupid things, like walking through labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized, this is a movie with a message, that message is for children and this will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insect monster that grows and causes a bit of chaos before dying in the typical way of "killing the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing of Blue or any Simian of any kind. Now brat like he was cheated or something. The image on the cover had an insect / crab / idiot / giant in the front chasing some screaming nurses. That happened a bit but I wanted monkeys! Having enjoyed the MOST EXTREME SPRING a few nights before (half drunk with Cask and Creame brandy, I think) I was in the mood for the style of the 80 most abducted monkeys. Not that much. If you like snowboarding monkeys or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like insects and good reasons to hit children, rent this.
