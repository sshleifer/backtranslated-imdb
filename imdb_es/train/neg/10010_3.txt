The plot does not deserve discussion, even if it implies corruption, murders, power and the rest of topics related to the thriller. The characters are interesting, though sometimes. However, it is not realistic, but it is interesting. <br /> <br /> The development is slow, like the tea drinking ceremony. The images are not impressive, but they are good enough to relieve visual fatigue. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed, nothing too surprising, nothing exaggerated. Movie comedy style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody: excellent performance. He had to fight against the inadequacy of the plot and did the job quite well. The rest is bearable although very predictable. The set is visible and better than most television programs.
