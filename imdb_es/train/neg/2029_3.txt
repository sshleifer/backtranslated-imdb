I do not see enough programs of television games to understand the attractiveness of SHOWING THE MONEY, but I suppose that it has certain attractiveness for the little demanding audiences. Apparently a question and answer program offers participants large sums of money to answer some simple questions. However, the elements of your questionnaire only play a small part in the procedures, which seems to me tortuously complicated. For example, before answering a question, a participant selects what question to ask when choosing between the random options "A", "B" or "C". Does this serve another purpose other than to slow down the game? It would be much faster to just start with "A". Participants can pass questions, but they must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the participant is asked to "close" the response, another delay tactic. The contestant's next task is to name the woman of a dozen go-go dancers in cages and reveal a card that indicates how much the question is worth. A correct answer adds the dollar amount of the card to the participant's total accumulated; An incorrect answer subtracts the same sum. This step, which takes a long time, actually has some entertainment value, since it allows the audience to closely observe the dancers with little clothes and uniformly beautiful. Meanwhile, the participant is reminded that an unfortunate selection of the "killer card" will end the game instantly. This naturally causes the contestant to sweat and cause further delays while the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I suspect that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the attractiveness of the main audience of the program. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is slowed down further by a lot of empty jokes between host William Shatner and the participant, along with occasional Routines of the caged dancers. All these delays consume so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is for when the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDY often ends. up to 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM that I saw only answered six questions (many of which referred to other television programs). No one in their right mind would see this program because it's fun to keep up with the questions at home. That leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a competitor responds to being on the verge of winning as much as a million dollars, only to lose everything at one stroke. <br /> <br /> B. To look at beautiful young women who perform sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. To enjoy the sparkling jokes of William Shatner. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but the women are not in the chamber long enough to justify the suffering for an hour of this show.
