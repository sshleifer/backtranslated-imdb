Ok I'm blessed I've seen two very strong theatrical productions, one in New York with the original cast and one in the San Diego Representative (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, rockers!). In comparison to any of these, the movie is almost impossible to see. I've been reviewing the DVD for the last two nights and I still have not finished. Too much weird dialogue, and waaay too many scenes and people added. Yes, the four great performances are quite good, esp. From Mrs. Streep. But comparing stage with film is definitely an example of "less is more". The thickening of the work to satisfy the spectators' need for variety and scenic specificity was a bad choice. Please, please, go and find a theatrical production near you.
