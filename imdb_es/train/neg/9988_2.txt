Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is fine until an ex appears and things get a little complicated ... While I was watching this movie, I asked myself several times why he was doing it . doing that ... because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and it's badly written without any kind of credibility. Nor does the audience really care about what happens ... Even the lovely Cameron can not keep this on a scale of one to ten.2
