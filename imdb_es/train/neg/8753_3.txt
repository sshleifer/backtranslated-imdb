This movie reminds me of something worse than A Mary-Kate and Ashley, just movies. Just the kind things of the rich sisters, I think that even though Alysons was more of an actress, in this movie, Amanda michalka was fine sometimes, but Alysons acted badly. I think that after the high school musical they had to find something better and it definitely was not that. The story was not so good and I think they should have got two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not make me like it anymore. I think you should definitely be sick to sing and just watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which, unfortunately, I did not)
