I give this film a ONE, because it's really a horrible movie. The sound track of the DVD is so bad that my ear hurts. But the vision, no matter how unconnected, shows something really sophisticated in Italian society. I will not go into detail about what was really shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So for the value of the twist, I give it one. Otherwise, the video, the photography, the performance of the adult actors / actresses are simply of low quality, a practical athlete for people who love foreign films. Robert, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions. but exaggerated to the point of being incredible. However, the children in the film are mostly 3/4 years old, they are genuine and the film offers a glimpse of Italian life.
