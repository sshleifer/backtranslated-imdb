"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent of the Interpol branch in the 17th London Office, which specializes in (I believe) hidden criminals. She possesses the Eye of Destiny, well in her hands, dangerous if someone else got it. <br /> <br /> Bureau 17 has captured a California satanist, Hyde (unrelated to Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD flies to England to bring him back to the United States. Lutz is the connection with the previous films of Witchcraft, having been interpreted by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9. In part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; In 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Lutz's part at 9 was not terribly big, but it's one of the main stars in this one. Even though she has left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing tops on this one. And this time he has scenes of nudes and sex. Beaton is pretty attractive on paper. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are several sex scenes. An anonymous cluboner has a fatal trio with two vampires, the Satanist and the chief vampire do it with some problem, Lutz finds an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character in The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this, although Lutz mentions Officer Dixon of Office 17 in a conversation about vampires. She also calls her partner Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), although we did not hear her end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde is taken out of jail by a group of vampires led by Raven. , for a Walpurgis ritual that has something to do with a god called Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines in a very flat way, while Raven exaggerates to a campy degree. The fight scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The audio of the movie was badly recorded and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost under loud music or sirens. The cinematography is not great either. However, having the film set and shot in the UK was a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good like Celeste; attractive, certainly, but the most important thing is that he is easily the best actor in the movie (despite the bad fight scenes). I'm quite surprised that his filmography is so small. If there is ever a Witchcraft XIV, and I bet there will be, they should bring it back, even if it means taking it to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone or on the DVD the Hotter Than Hell collection along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
