This movie was quite interesting ... I had to see it in a university class on India, however, the synopsis tells you that this movie is about a thing when it really does not contain much cold and hard information about those details. It is not really faithful to the synopsis until the end, where they try to carelessly tie all the elements. The gore factor is excellent, however. Even from the beginning, you should look the other way because the blood is quite intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see some cold blood, because the plot is thin and you will be sad that you have wasted your time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other websites that this movie is based on real events, however, you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
