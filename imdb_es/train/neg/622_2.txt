This movie is so annoying. The main character seems to be 35 years old and I've seen squalid beans with more balls than this guy. The twists of the plot are so predictable that it is not even worth observing the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Also some of the worst dialogues I've heard in 3 years, "let's find a small animal to torture." <br /> <br /> Ugh ..... I can not even continue, do not look at this pile of garbage, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the drunk A friend calls the main character a fag to draw pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, you can not see
