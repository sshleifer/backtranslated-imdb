It is not that "a Ulli Lommel movie" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to fall below my lower expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their first projects, which is great to give these children the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive films. But many of these young filmmakers have also thought about filtering the finished film so that it qualitatively looks more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. There lies the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie is like watching a telenovela by a murderer. He does not feel like watching a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. You should know that it is virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense) in the video. For the love of God this boy has been running since the sixties! He may be the only director who has not improved in more than forty years of career in the business. And fortunately we, he also wrote the script! Therefore, you can expect complicated actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior and at least one really pretentious plot element that will leave you completely dissatisfied. Please, miss this movie. You will thank me later.
