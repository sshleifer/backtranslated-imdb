I was not completely impressed by this movie. It was originally called Sin Eater and should have stayed that way, since that's all that was talked about in the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do with the rest. It was very slow and what happened was to choose Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd say check this out if you're interested in things related to the Catholic religion, but do not expect there to be an exorcist or stigmata from this movie. Surely it will fail after a few days and the word will spread.
