Please, do not lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie, just do not do it. Especially if someone is lucky enough to be dozing beside you. Damn cheek if you ask me. I waited for something to happen, it never happened. I'm not one of those people to stop watching a movie in half. I always have to see it until the end. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go paint a wall and watch it dry, much more entertaining. Please, do not lose +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie, just do not do it.
