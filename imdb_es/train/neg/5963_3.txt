This film begins with the execution of a witchcraft practitioner and his lover. His head is cut and buried separately from his body ... it sounds like "The thing that will not die", is not it? Well, it plays a little like that, but once the body meets the head, all the interesting and frightening deaths are made and the film moves very slowly. I want to say that the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking "When will it end?" Most of the characters in the movie are idiots and deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad, as he moves slowly and really wonders how he manages to do anything considering that he is afraid of jewels. The only thing to keep you looking after the head comes back together is the fact that there are so many tits on the screen that you really start to lose track. Still, I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn movie and, like a horror movie, it's a way to move slowly with a lot of slow stretches to be even something nice. And do not read the back of the box, since it came out as if there were meat-eating zombies attacking the city, there is not ... just a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easy to refuse . They are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene does not make any sense. So, for the most part, I tell you that you should avoid this movie unless you find it very cheap.
