This (extremely) low budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night", as it is labeled as Slasher Flick. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (that was full of original flashbacks for more than half of the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to be psychological by presenting the main character as someone who goes crazy, (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He feels irritated by people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can not stand how manufactured toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed as Santa Claus, he finally goes on a wave of murders. It is also a strong word, since only 3 people die without the real need for special effects. There is no tension, no emotions, no gore, no sharing. For an exception is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile." He still has to kick himself these days for having accepted the role. He really is the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main leader. (who is not so bad either, but if you feel eclipsed by a small secondary character, you're not great either). And what about that strange ending? (You have to see it to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is frankly boring, nothing happens and the work of art is simply deceptive. This is not a slasher If you want to see a true Christmas slasher, check out the best of all time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
