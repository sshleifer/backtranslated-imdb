Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented he is, the great director who will one day be, etc. I think they're just being nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "The next Jane Campion", they call her; And, even apart from the fact that both are overrated, the two have SO much in common. Both direct movies. They are both women. Both are Australians. (Well, take it or leave it). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's one of those movies in which a character is considered brilliant, and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I'll say this for Carruthers: she's cute. -And fascinating. Not really. Here are some thoughts about your lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so terribly bad at making his crew even notice it? To make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and die, I suppose. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most unconvincing performances of a movie set I've seen? After all, it must have been filmed in a REAL movie. How could they be wrong? If Rendall's set was half of a staffed mess, it's a wonder he's completed his movie. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers, the fictional director, has set out to create a new horror movie from the 80s. Possibility of fat. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall, the current and most talented director, did the same job, realized that it could not be done and was satisfied with (sighing) knowing the parody. Of course, it is not ENOUGH of a parody to work as a parody. As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion, the film spent most of its time doing badly what the horror movies of the 80s did ... well, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, and yet ... the film begins with not a parody, but an honest pastiche to the goodness of the horror of the 80s, starring (this is too good for be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than everything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing to see the movie inside the movie, instead of the movie). However, it was also filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it is still possible to make the horror of the 80s. You just have to put aside the things of the parody and make it MEANING. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what the teenage horror of the 1980s would be like if all the characters had an Australian accent, but now I know. And strangely, I'm glad to know. A need I never knew I had had been fulfilled.
