This is possibly the worst Christmas movie in history. The plot is virtually non-existent, the performance (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this movie, but deep down they must agree. As far as I could tell, the plot was that a millionaire businessman told Ben Affleck to go to a place that would remind him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. By doing this, he ends up paying the family that currently lives in the house to be his family at Christmas ... and that's it. The movie continues and eventually meets with the family's daughter ... blah blah blah.
