I have never understood the appeal of Garbo. She always appears in her films as stuck, not so seductive, and that annoying voice that could have drowned the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swanson, much better than the left in the silent era. In this his last film, his performance is very normal and even without guarantee. She makes a great effort, but everything comes down to nothing because the script is even worse than her performance. <br /> <br /> One would be a romantic comedy that is never credible and never takes off (although Melvyn Douglas manages to do it). Get transported in the ski scenes, which are really the only fun here. <br /> <br /> There was a potential, but the script fails in almost all departments, wasting all the actors. Douglas and Garbo had enough chemistry together, but this is not a place in Ninotchka, which I also found extremely overrated.
