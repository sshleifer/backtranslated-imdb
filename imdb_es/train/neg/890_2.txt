I saw this pile of bullets regurgitated tonight in a preview and I was amazed by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie practically flaunted its open blind spots. No black New Yorkers or gays in love? Or who, say, knows white people self-involved in love? I know it's not the love crash of inclusion in the anvil, but you can not pretend to have a cinematic New York without these prevailing members of society. Besides, you know that the people who produced this thought thought that Crash deserved that Oscar with a strong hand, so where are they all? <br /> <br /> Possibly worse than the strange and deliberate socio-economic ignorance were the offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly upset with very young women in wheelchairs? This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. The bad performance, bad writing, bad management, cover all possible genres and refer to wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside luxury restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank God, they finally got the powers Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson to come together again for the Jumper meeting. And, note to the margin, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke is devastated. This, of course, is one thing in terms of his appearance, but he added an incredibly creepy extra feeling of horror to his terribly scripted scene in front of the poor and lovely Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I spent a terrible time choosing My least favorite scene for the end of the movie questionnaire, but it has to be the little Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the lack of taste, which makes me sad because I really like those two actors. I did not consider myself offended easily, but all I could do was mock and look around with disgust like the aunt of someone 50 years old. <br /> <br /> A close second in this incredibly close contest of terrible things is the dull tone of Shia LaBeouf of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against. Against is the only explanation. Now I realize that the initial sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. ENHANCEMENT. Keep this in mind when your brain begins to seep into your ear shortly after the initial credits, which seem to be a nod to the first real world of New York. This film is shameful, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> (The additional star is for the Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach sequence, since it's pretty sweet, but it's just a bright spot in what feels like hours of useless and masturbatory torment).
