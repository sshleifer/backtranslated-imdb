Personally I think this show seems pretty cheap done. Some of the actors are terrible. They do it more and they seem false. I can always say how it will end within the first 10 minutes or less of observation because they make it so clear and transparent. Neither is very well written. I love seeing it to laugh at it. You already know the saying "Is it so bad that it's good?" Well, that saying applies to this show. I also like to look just to see if I'm right when I guess everything is going to end. Until now I have been right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's nice when you're bored and you want to laugh at something.
