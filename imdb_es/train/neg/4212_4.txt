The beginning of this film is excellent, with a tremendous sound and a good mood, but once the film becomes animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons was that, at least for me, it was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with very little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. Occasionally it breaks and looks very good, but not very often. In addition, the characters come and go too fast. For example, I would have liked to have seen more than "Moby Dick". However, when the film begins to crawl, it resumes with the entrance of the dragon and then the film ends strongly. <br /> <br /> In general, not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last twelve years.
