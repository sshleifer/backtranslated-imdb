I saw this movie, along with all the other adaptations I could get, including seeing works, in preparation for some academic research. The cinematography is very moving, as is music. Unfortunately, all life was taken out of history. I've never seen such a horrible portrait of Mr. Rochester. All its most fundamental features are gone. Where is your wit? Where is your passion? Scott's Rochester looks more like the Rochester film, St. John, than the character in the novel. In fact, the actor who plays St. John in this adaptation played a passionate St. John, while Scott is happy to break things or just look at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography, but I honestly can not watch this movie for a long time due to the performance of George C. Scott.
