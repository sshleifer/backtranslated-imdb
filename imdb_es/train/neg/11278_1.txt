This film is simply one of the worst movies ever made and is a damning accusation not only for the British film industry, but also for the untalented people who work today. The film was not only distributed in a conventional way, but also has a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I do not know and I just do not care enough to get involved in the debate because the movie was so terrible that it does not deserve the slightest idea. Be careful and stay away from this garbage. but apparently, I need to write ten lines of text in this revision, so I could also detail the plot. His evil friend and co-worker organize a nob of a man out of his father's company and, therefore, leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and the unreliable accents and stupid and stupid twists / devices of the plot. I should have asked for my money back, but maybe I was still shocked by the experience. If you want a good crime movie, look at the usual suspects or the godfather, what about Lock, Stock ...? That is the peak of the contemporary British crime movie ...
