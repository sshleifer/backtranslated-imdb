Sistas en da hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except that Da Hood is a wild western city at the end of the 19th century. I do not remember any western like this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If I saw Lil 'Kim, I could say, "Okay, I have to admit I hooked up to this just to see her." The bare waist and low-cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy movie, but these they're cowgirls, and they're fine. <br /> <br /> Now, look no important history here, and the usual things in the ghetto crime drama are here in a different environment, and when was the last time Did you hear John? Wayne called someone, "Dawg?" And, I do not remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they went to the OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I see this in BET, so I missed the The action that occurred is an R rating, but I doubt you will buy the DVD to see it unless you can be sure it was Lil 'Kim in that action.
