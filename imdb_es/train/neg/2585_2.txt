This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only that it has almost nothing to do with the other American Pie films, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> However, the girls are nice, but spending your time watching a soft and cheap porn would possibly be better than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very badly made sex Announcement, made for an audience that is not more than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I never visited an American university, but I would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh at any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
