SPOILERS: It always amazes me how many people gave good reviews to this game. It was horrible. The script and the acting voice alone ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unpleasant characters in the game. You almost pray for their deaths. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you're waiting for some kind of vampire story in the style of Anne Rice, forget it. The history of this game has very little to do with vampires. You will not even see until the end, and even then, you will not be able to fight against them. <br /> <br /> The story has a radical and rather blasphemous view of Christianity. I'm surprised he got off the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian and I found it offensive. Mainly, the story centers on a search for The Holy Grail and a buried treasure. The kidnapping of a real baby, which should have been the focus, is really pushed aside. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first blocks of time. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty bad. The characters move at a snail's pace even in the best of systems. They are thick and outdated. And it's hard to go from The Beast Within FMV to this horrible gaming engine for Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also takes a terrible turn. I really do not know why he was so horribly rushed, but they do sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks Grace is more of a sister and does not think she is right for him. And it seems really disgusted that they slept together. But it's so unpleasant in the whole game, that you almost do not care at that moment. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendo in any woman throughout the game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be a letter from Dear John. I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was annoying and boring. I expected to tell the story of a real baby who was kidnapped by vampires. And I hoped to see and fight vampires, maybe even make Gabriel or Grace become one. But no. Instead, the story focused on the author's distorted view of Christianity. What a pity. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got this. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were really at the end. In the end we got some action style puzzles. But it was not worth suffering the whole game to get to them. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this game. I had recovered it when it came out, years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I filed it away for years. I recently dusted it to see what I had been missing. And now, I'm sorry I did it. My favorite characters were ruined. I hope there is a fourth game to redeem the series. And I hope you do it right next time. It would be a terrible shame to finish the series with this installment.
