As far as I know, Largo winch was a famous Belgian comic (never read) that tells the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without the life of a spy! Then, when I had to choose a movie for a 5-year-old boy, I chose it because I was already a big James Bond fan! <br /> <br /> But, right after the opening credits, I have many doubts: when American films offer an incredible start, here, is there no action and a torrid sex scene? So, is history complicated by financial movements? I thought I had lost the child. <br /> <br /> But, strangely, he had been caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the excellent performance of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? The history of the multiple boxes in which friends are the bad ones, the bad ones are the friends. The exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> I do not know, but he really cares about Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoy our moment.
