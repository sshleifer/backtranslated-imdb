This movie was awful, from conception to execution. Should the United States set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? Is this your premise? The way to get access, concludes EE. UU., It is to win an obstacle course like the cross-country race, where the winner can ask the leader for something. And who better to win this race known as the "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was an operative. Luckily for our hero, it turns out that there are gymnastics teams in lucky places, like the stone knob in the middle of a square (for no reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But above and beyond the horrible and horrible premise, there are the awkward discomforts of the romantic scenes, the obviously depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be to hold a flag to mark the path of the race , and the worst climax of all. After winning the race, our hero expresses the wishes of the government of the United States. And behold, all the effort was worth it, because EE. UU Get your site "Star Wars"! Huzzah! IS THIS THE END OF YOUR TRIUMPHANT? Wow <br /> <br /> But still, for being such a bad movie, it can be very fun to watch it. The cover alone, representing ninjas with machine guns, was enough for me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if I ever meet Kurt Thomas (the star gymnast) in real life, I'll probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 turns in the position of design.
