Treat every stereotype and distortion you have heard about semi-devout Mormons, and you will see that everyone has starred in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally, the fortunes of Kurt Hale have changed (thank God) and I hope it will be a long time before we see any of their roles in theaters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amateur (I think they used a camcorder for some basketball scenes). The plot was loose and very funny. You really did not understand why someone did something. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound woman was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this movie a negative rating was because The balance does not let me.
