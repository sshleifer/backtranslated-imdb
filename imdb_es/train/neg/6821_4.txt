It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story, which was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there were too many things at stake and a lack of ability to restart everything. The acting was good to be cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the strongest actors had their moments of lower quality acting. It took me a couple of months to go through the whole movie because it did not keep my attention and the flow was just bad. I just finished watching it and I'm glad I did as the film finally moves and has some continuity towards the end. Once again, a good story, but the delivery was below average. I would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little sweet eye, and I mean, a little.
