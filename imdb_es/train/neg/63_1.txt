My God. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no argument. Really! There is no plot! A lot of clowns talk about this and that and that's your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is senile and keeps asking the same people the same questions over and over again. This gives you the same answers over and over again. I'm pretty sure this movie reached six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well-considered actors, but the real work is a torrid turd. Well, maybe that's a bit misleading because the steam that rises from a new battery sounds a bit like something is happening and in this movie, NOTHING HAPPENS! Coat
