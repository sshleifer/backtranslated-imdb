Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen, yes, is related to Bruce), the assassin of the first movie, returns to her old tricks. She is one of the counselors of Camp Rolling Hills. While the girls in the camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and oaths are fine. But one step beyond the line and Angela kills them, making bad jokes all the time. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty movie, but it had some positive points. This is vicious and unpleasant too, but it does not have good points for it. The plot has been made to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula. There are a lot of bloody murders here (people are burned alive, heads are cut off, throats cut) but all the blood is so obviously false that it becomes comical. This also has the least amount of campers I've seen and practically everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is free female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory team of good girl / good boy (Renne Est√©vez and Tony Higgins). With the only exception of Springsteen and Higgins, the acting is terrible, even by movie standards. There is also a cruel advantage in this film in which a character drowns in a dependency! Bored and sick with a stupid plot, meaningless nudity and bad blood. Skip it.
