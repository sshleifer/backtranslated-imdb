5 minutes in this movie I was hyperventilating, trembling and writhing in pain. And not in the good way. The story is about a group of idiotic children who make phone jokes to a psychopath, which is always a good idea. It turns out that psychologists do not like joke phone calls because in 2 minutes he is at his door killing the poor mom and Father Williams. Well, jump forward 15 years and guess what? Still telephone jokes calling people. Yes, you would have thought that a horrible murder would dissuade them from doing it again, but no. So after about two hours and too many screams, I realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to take my life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at the shoddy production, the "acting", or Rutger has slowed his career. I love bad horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory piece I've seen. Just no
