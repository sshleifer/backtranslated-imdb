It must be assumed that those who praised this film ("the best filmed opera in history", did not I read somewhere?) Do not care about opera, do not care about Wagner or do not care about anything except His desire to appear cultivated. Whether as a representation of Wagner's swan song, or as a movie, this strikes me as an absolute disaster, with a lead reading of the score paired to a deceptive and lugubrious realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is questionable that people with ideas about what an "opera" (or, in reality, a play, especially a Shakespeare play) should be authorized anywhere near a theater or theater. cinema Studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification of Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "on" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the later stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik baby , although one that continues to sing high tenor - few or none of the actors in the film are the singers, and we received a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who looks like the face (but does not sound like the voice ) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in the double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the execution of the music of Good Friday, in which, by the way, the transcendent beauty of nature is represented by a dispersion of the stores and the flaccid crocuses trapped in bad conditions The lawn, a file that baffles me. In the theater, sometimes we have to solve those imperfections with our thoughts, but I can not think why Syberberg could not splice, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as exuberant as it was for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music. . <br /> <br /> The sound is difficult to bear, the loud voices and the trumpets in particular have an auditory radiance that adds another type of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired driving and the paralytic display of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the Bayreuth recording of 1951, and Knappertsbusch, although his tempi is often very slow, he had what Jordan lacked completely, a pulse sensation, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music, and, after half a century , the orchestral sound in that set, in the modern pulsations, is still superior to this film.
