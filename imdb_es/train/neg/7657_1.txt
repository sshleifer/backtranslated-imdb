There should be a rule that clearly states that films like Resident Evil should be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of flying as much as possible. RE was a survival horror game, and very effective in that, but Paul WS Anderson made it look like any other video game movie. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so, of course, there is the slight hope that the director will have a bit of brains enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. On the other hand, Alone in the Dark only shows that there is no longer any hope that video games will become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, although obviously it should not matter, is the biggest of the many problems. with the movie The movie begins with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, because after a minute, the audience stops worrying and only sits down while the rest hits the object more near. Then there is something about an orphanage, some artifacts, an old tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which are so mixed that viewers really can not keep up with what is happening. The characters enter and leave the plot as candy, some with huge accumulations of senseless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons were released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some connection with them thanks to an operation given to the children in his orphanage that has failed him. Find an artifact that involves the demons and takes it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who of course manages to have sex immediately without a good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the couple ends up with a military team led by an imbecile commander (Dorff), who apparently feels a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> Everything is ridiculous, and the reason why I do not really understand is not just because it is complicated and confusing, but it does not leave room for anyone to really care. Instead, I strongly recommend that, if you have to watch this movie, bring a tennis ball or something to take care of when the plot gets you into confusion. <br /> <br /> Action scenes in a movie with a plot. As terrible as this should at least bring it a bit, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined shit that has been made, with enough quick cuts to decapitate a chicken coop. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene that involves a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is one of the worst I've had to witness. , and the rest is not so good either. The demons look somewhat cool, although the fact that they turn to dust when they are killed eliminates all that effect. The scenes that involve a lot of guns that should be great to watch, instead, involve cannon fire as the only source of light and focus and movement of the camera faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all the kind of seizure-inducing garbage that keeps kids in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing more than sound important to the whole movie, although he seems to have more talent than he is letting on. The same can be said of Dorff, who gets an ungrateful role despite having some talent (something that has happened a lot). Reid is almost exactly what it should be, sexual attractive in the background, since every time he tries to act is a disaster (as is the scientific look so bad that has at the beginning). <br /> <br /> In general, This is the kind of movie that worries me about future video game films. If they continue to ruin the spirit in this way, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing the Middle East with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting an alien squadron. However, unlike Resident Evil, this does not deserve a second chance, since I do not think anything can help me forget how terrible this movie is. It's tasteless, uninteresting and uninteresting. This is the film equivalent to diarrhea; everything came together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you're glad it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
