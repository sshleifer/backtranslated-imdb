ALL FOR LOVE (as it was titled when it aired over the weekend) is a romantic period drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he is and falls in love with him A young maid who visits the prison. There is also a story that involves murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and confess that the film did not captivate me, since I am not a fan of period dramas and the script feels somewhat episodic, but I will say that this is well acted by all involved and he has a good cast that features Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The design of the wardrobe as you can expect is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this movie does not receive any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at tea time. Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there is a scene of French bathing prisoners that includes male frontal nudes without mentioning a murder scene in which blood is seen. You really have to worry if the BBC programmers have some kind of clue about what they are doing.
