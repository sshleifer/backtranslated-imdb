I searched for a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special, I think "Where Are They Now", and I saw the video frame on the screen during a segment of actor Corky Pigeon. He played the infant ghost child in this horrible horror of B, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the TV show Silver Spoons. This movie is a big disappointment. There is nothing here. Actually it took me four months to see it from start to finish. I kept stopping him out of boredom, leaving him aside and forgetting him, then I tripped over him and tried once more to get through. Obviously, the angle of this film that sought to distinguish it from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously, here, that does not work. I can not stand male cables. I kept waiting for them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes to read the cheat lines. The situation at the beginning, in which the couples decide to go camping separately, is uncomfortable and simply silly. I guess the only positive thing that can be said about this is the scene in which the guy falls and breaks a leg, you can see the bone coming out of his flesh. Gore makeup is pretty good there. Man, I'm really getting to a positive now, huh. The only other horror movie with no budget at a level as bad as this would be Home Sweet Home.
