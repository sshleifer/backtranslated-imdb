I can not even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I guess everything is part of America's nonsense. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this show more when he got his original title: "Seinfeld". What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the basic and obvious sense of "humor" and general sophistication, is the pretentious way in which episodes are titled. The really great shows are still fun after many repeated reproductions, such as "Rob accidentally hypnotizes himself", "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "where Lucy and Ethel work in the candy factory". In other words, it is an honor bestowed upon the great programs by the spectators. That the writers and producers of "Friends" would have the absolute arrogance to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a way, before someone had the opportunity to see it a second time, not only speaks of mediocrity and lack of Original thinking on the part of these writers, but also of the stunned minds of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You read the comments of some of these people and can only conclude that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, filled with feelings of greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Awake. These people are supposed to work in cafeterias and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live at $ 4000 / month. apartments? Be realistic All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic life of New York with their Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all that. That New York does not exist for anyone who earns less than a serious six-figure income. But, good luck with all that, anyway. Now, shut up and the Soma passes.
