These writings write about the end of the plot, so do not read it if you have not seen this garbage. <br /> <br /> I found this garbage movie in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror. If I had a video store, I would put it in the BOREDS section. This movie is so trash that it will make you feel like you've lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This movie contains endless shots of people driving as if that were scary. Well, I drive to work and return (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me, it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little boy does it too. Round and round it goes and it never stops. What is so scary to see a little boy riding a bicycle for an hour? I do not think anything, and if you look at it, you will not think it either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives at a big castle and is given a walking tour incessantly, looking at the kitchens. Then the man walks for about an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see, it's garbage.
