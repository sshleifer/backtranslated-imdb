THE TEMP (1993) did not do much theatrical business, but here is the direct scam to the video that you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman of Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage firm, which is beginning to receive useful advice from the open-eyed secretary, Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious dads girl who will stop at nothing to move up the corporate ladder, including screwing up a top runner who can not stand and kill anyone who gets on her bad side. She digs up skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while making it look like she is responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to make her misuse the company's money. <br /> <Harris and Kelley provide competent performances, the cast of support is fine and reasonably well organized, but that does not fully compensate for a script that travels a very worn path and offers few surprises.
