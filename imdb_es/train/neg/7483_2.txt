One might think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should be, at least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest comedy plays of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently I was wrong: this is one of the worst movies I have. never seen. It amazes me how one joke after another can be so deeply without grace. It hurt me to see these talented actors perform one of the most negative scripts I've had the misfortune to find. Based solely on the big names, I kept hope for a long time throughout the film, but did not offer any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to let go. I can count on one hand, maybe even with two or three fingers, important Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this, I really did. But outsiders finally fail miserably. If you really want entertainment that saves you time, just take your money and watch it spin while you flush it down the toilet. Just please do not watch this movie.
