While breaking the strange good joke, the humor is usually quite dry with panel members who frequently flip faces or resort to rude language and wait for the crowd to applaud bad enough jokes. <br /> <br /> Unlike what is another comment says that I do not think this is the best RTE that has been made, it is really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of ingenuity, there are some really fun intelligent gags that would make you laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by comedians well-known names instead of judging the quality of gags that are not really that good. In general, it is mediocre with some good laughs, but can often be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I find Benny Hill more fun.
