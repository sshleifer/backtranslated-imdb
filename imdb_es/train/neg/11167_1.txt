Usually, Jack Black can make me laugh by simply breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Besides the direction, the writing, the lack of argument, the constant hold-up (aided and encouraged by the shots of constant and straight line camera), and a batting average of .050, was still a total waste of time. The idea seems promising, but the potential there was wasted with a total lack of comedy and one of the worst directions I've seen this side of you-tube. <br /> <br /> I kept hearing that this movie is represented Mexicans very negatively. While that is certainly true, I really do not think this film should be racist. I think that is more as a result of a "creative" team that desperately tries to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying behind the camera: "Hey, look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all tenacious things, LAUGHTER!" <br /> <br /> But put the racism Charges aside. When it comes to that, it's someone who invested good money and time to see this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, IMO.
