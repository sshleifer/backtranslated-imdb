Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome led by a film student who idolizes John Woo and gets "Power Play". The idea was good, but the execution, the performance and the dialogue killed it completely, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of sequences of violence and disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the most interesting parts of the movie. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of an activist guerrilla group that mysteriously disappeared after they broke into the offices of a power station that is suspected of causing an earthquake frenzy . The rather arrogant reporter, facing what should have been a more ruthless group of company executives, is persecuted by the city (along with anyone with whom he speaks) to "clean up" any conclusive evidence that may be left of the failures. of the plant. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergence because the characters interact with much hesitation, along with idiotic dialogue and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention that the viewer, who may only be attracted to the film because of its appeal of the action genre, is forced to endure an increasing number of bodies and ridiculous amounts of violent scenes and scenes of the earthquake disaster. The entire focus was placed in the wrong place to compensate in the form of an apology for the lack of direction and a more interesting sequence of events that should have driven the story. It could have been much better if the filmmakers had focused more on a thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who try to alert the reporter of the bad deeds that are being committed. It's formulaic, but at least it would have been entertaining.
