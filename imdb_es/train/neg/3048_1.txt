This is perhaps the most spooky sign of Santa Claus committed to any medium, be it a book, an image or a movie. Santa Claus looks like a pervert who looks at children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's henchmen, Pitch, it does not make things better. It is ridiculous to say the least, with bad effects, even by the standards of 1959. If a child saw this movie, he would have nightmares and would never want Santa to visit. They would be marked for life. Imagine the children in "A Christmas Story" when they start screaming after they put them in Santa's lap. This is how it would be if the children saw this movie.
