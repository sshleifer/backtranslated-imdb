This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I've had the privilege of seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD with a group of friends on Friday night and we could not stop laughing from start to finish. Finish. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: terrorists kidnap a convoy they believe carries uranium weapons, but in reality leads a handful of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy mistake to commit. It indicates a surprisingly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to confront the prehistoric beasts. They are directed by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the performance of 'Sniffing the Fart', as Joey defends in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem pointing their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant and heavy monsters. Also, the lights always seem to blink and turn off when a Velociraptor attacks (presumably, so we can not see how severe the effects of the creatures are). <br /> <br /> Having said all that, we all have a great amount of fun. Betting on who is going to take the head off the next. <br /> <br /> As an action adventure in the style of Jusassic Park / Aliens, this film stinks more than the crotch of a dinosaur, but as ridiculous, with the tongue on the cheek Entertainment is a great success.
