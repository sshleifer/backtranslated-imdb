In a dormitory at the university, a man is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She is institutionalized. A year later, she is out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend spring break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a beautiful and beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally, the killer appears (without any reason) and begins to kill again. <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thriller: a textbook example on how NOT to make a low budget horror movie. To begin with, a large part of this film is filled WITHOUT END of these six idiots who record themselves, "have fun" (they are more fun than the audience), get drunk, act stupidly, etc. Also here there are NO nudity. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but ANYTHING to encourage this would help. None of the deaths are actually shown (the listeners), they are just a little bloody and there is no gore. There is one really horrible, but that is not all until the end. <br /> <br /> With some exceptions, the performance stinks. Dorie Barton is terrible as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is terrible as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is really very good, handsome and handsome, and he's giving this shit everything. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Logical lapses abound: after realizing that a friend has been killed, two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's reaction to seeing a friend die is funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Bored, stupid, without blood, without nudity, omit this. <br /> <br /> Rated with R for graphic violence and some obscene language.
