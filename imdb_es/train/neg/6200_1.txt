This is the most disturbing movie I've seen. It makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although, technically, it is reasonably well done, acting, cinematography, music, direction, etc., are good. However, the scene of gang rape is the most atrocious and violent thing I have seen and I really wish I had not seen it. I am afraid that he will pursue me for the rest of my life. Although I think that anyone would find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way and I really did not need an explicit reminder of the horror they experienced. I watched the film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX, and none of the cast members or the team attended. I would have liked them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I found excessive, gratuitous and unnecessary. A previous scene successfully transmitted the state of mind for which they were apparently struggling, but without rubbing their faces in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie should have a great WARNING label on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned
