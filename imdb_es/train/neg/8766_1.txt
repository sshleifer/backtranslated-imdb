I should put an alert everywhere saying that the movie should not be seen. It fails in an appropriate tribute in such a magnificent way that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was horrible, I did not expect the director not to appreciate military technology. How can you fire a machine gun that normally fires at a rate of 600 rounds per minute at 1/10 of the speed? How can soldiers fall when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells that fall at a distance of 20 feet? How is it possible that the artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road and not the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only this lack of respect for the weaponry horrified me, but also the cliché situations and the incongruity of the dialogues. He made me scream murder. There were standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross karo e hukum hai mera. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is only one shooting after the next, with no connection to the general outline of the war. The explanatory scenes are horrible. The army chief of staff does not seem convincing. To make matters worse, the people of the theater had indiscriminately cut images so that the four-hour movie could be adjusted to 3 hours.
