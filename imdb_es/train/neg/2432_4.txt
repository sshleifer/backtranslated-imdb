There is not much to say about this. A plot that you can paste enough, in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too bad with this movie, too little action for an action movie. There was an opportunity to explore the emotions of the characters from time to time. If an action movie is the right genre to do that, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without paying full attention, as it had small twists and a direct plot. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or undivided attention it may be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
