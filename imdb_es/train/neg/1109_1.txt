This is almost certainly the worst western I've seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common in martial and western arts films: the hero learns that family / friends have been killed, so the hero sets out to avenge himself, frustrates the ineffective agent of the law, rescues the little lady kidnapped and murdered the arch-nemesis expert in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful, otherwise it would not be a formula, but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated execution you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple and insulting; It seems that a high school student wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; Sometimes it seems bent. The cinematography is scarce, and the sets are sometimes only facades. The performance is regrettable; Sure, some of the artists could blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope to never see Chris Lybbert again in a role as a speaker; Every time he says a line that should be angry or angry, he only lowers the timbre of his voice and sounds like a child who tries to act in a macho way. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his outfit (if you dare to see this movie): You saw these new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a dirty and working cowboy. . If you enjoy a cinematic kitchen that serves simply to worship the imagined greatness of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, observe something else.
