Because some people, like me, like to know EVERYTHING about a movie, even if they plan to see it, including the ending. Anyway, here is the end, as I remember it, because I could not have been more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on television. But I will tell you that I sure scared the little boy who was, and I thought about it for days afterwards, and it still remains in my mind to this day, although some of the details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember that! I did not even remember that old Barnabus was in this movie, and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is attracted to the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, although I remember him as an old family doctor or something instead of a judge, see how he remembers the memory). fades?) to the place of the wedding, which I remember is in a cave of some kind? Maybe I was wrong; and Shelley Winters is laughing, and the judge has a cloak on, and the angle of the camera is like looking at it, and he throws the cloak back, and has goat legs, and he announces that it's really his father, the Devil. , and she has played directly in their hands (of the satanic cult), because the "mortal" man she has fallen in love with (I think that is Robert Foxworth) also turns out to be the guy Satan wants to marry her with, The Demon with Eyes yellow, and yes, of course, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes shine yellow. There are many close ups in the last minutes of the movie. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something, and that's the end. The bad guys win.
