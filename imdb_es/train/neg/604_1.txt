This movie disgusted me so much that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie has no history, plot or suggestion of purpose. The film begins after the introduction of the standard film "let us scare", which at this point all moviegoers have become accustomed. So we can ignore the principle completely. Soon we introduce the main actress and, from this point, it is clear to everyone that you just wasted your money and that it would be better to observe the static. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a MISTAKE and everyone must return to the travel pantomime where they came from. That said, even the best actors in the world would have a hard time making this movie remotely viewable. Their poor results simply contribute to disaster. Meaningless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of another "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, has resulted in a movie that will put your patience to the test. It was not until my fellow observer turned to me and said, "We've been watching this for 45 minutes." I realized that this movie is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Instead of suggesting what is missing in the film, let me tell you what it has: Blond mute (surprise surprise), Victims, bad monster type thing, approximately 2 minutes of history that extends by hours, days, weeks, months. ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit daring in some of the scenes, but she hopes to want to see her face cheated by the rest of the movie!
