It's amazing how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it, it should really deserve them, but because in all categories it was nominated as Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some would say that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost him at this point in his career, but he did not buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb BAJO EL VOLC√ÅN, a study of dark characters set in Mexico, which is among the best he has ever done. For its part, Prizzi's Honor, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and plot of a gangster in love with a Hit-Man woman prefigures the peculiar crimedies that surprised Hollywood in the early 90s, but the script is too complicated by itself, the motivations They are off and, in general, the story seems unsure of what it is trying to be: a romantic comedy. , a criminal drama, a saga of gangsters, etc. Jack Nicholson (doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but does not seem convincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just reviewing the almost sleepwalking movements as they pass through some parts . Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, fares better, but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations: she starts being the victim of her grandfather's father's disdain, proves to be a support for her ex-husband, then turns into a Vengeful bitch that wants to get on her head. a dish. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film have a washed quality like the one made in the early 70s and the direction of Huston is as uninteresting as everything else. There is a promise behind the story and, perhaps, in the hands of a hungry director to be recognized, it could have turned into something better, but what remains is a movie that nobody was really interested in doing.
