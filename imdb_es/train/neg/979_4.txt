Anyone with a remote interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to start, which is fine, but the truth is that THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are much better options than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It is still one of the biggest and forgotten movies, but the impact of its scenery is becoming a reality every day that passes. Charlton Heston oversized his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, takes full advantage of SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone and his final scenes are moving. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and the food is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A great executive of the company Soylent is murdered and police detective Thorn is in the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of Soylent Green is not a mystery if you investigate about the movie. It's nice to see SOYLENT, but the whole script is a joke. It's as cheap as all the production. The script and the drama of the actors made the film, however, they were completely funny. Everyone seems to be an imbecile and nobody knows the rules, specifically the police Thorn, who likes to simply enter the apartments of people, read without shame and steal what he wants. The character interactions keep your attention in the movie, but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN stinks. A nice piece if you have time, but do not expect anything else.
