This movie is one long chiche after another. First of all, although they did their part, there is an unjustified drug scene where John smells like an idiot grass. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is the unpleasant, envious, intimate homosexual, Yoko's slave. He is described as part of the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep releasing song titles in regular conversations "it was always just the two of us"! John would not have been bad with his fans in this way either. Like his death he showed us that he was too good in any case. The only funny scene is when a Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something like "Claro and while I sing, why do not you kneel, put on your wife's wig and tie my ligita?" That made me laugh for days. Actually this movie is funny because of the seriousness with which it tries to be ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny and cheerful guys who even during The Beatles split up where it is much nicer than what is described here. Forget this.
