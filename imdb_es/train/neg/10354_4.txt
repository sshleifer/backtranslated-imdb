I was browsing Netflix and I came across this movie. Having good memories of the book as a child, I decided to review this. This is a movie that really should broadcast. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel that it would even be like that for young children. It does not have any magic that contains the book. This movie is not horrible, but you will realize that you do not mind ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that become strange. The character of the witch is not very good. The family acts as if it were not a big thing that these strange things are happening. I know this is a children's movie, so as an older audience we should not look too deeply, but the whole movie seems to have been written and produced by people who have never had a cinematic experience before. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I started jumping in the last moments of the movie, and instead of trying to fix it, I turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
