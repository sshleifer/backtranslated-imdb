Now I have seen this movie twice, and I must say that I enjoyed it twice. It's fast and fun, but in the end it's silly. That said, it deserves to be destroyed for having ruined what could have been a good follow-up to the original original. It is clear to those who have seen the horrible 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films may be due to Bruno Mattei, and that the little commendable is for Fulci. This is not the behavior of Fulci inactive, the styles of the directors are totally contrasted and it can be said who directed what, particularly in the case of Mattei. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the outbreak of a virus as a "secret" by a scientist, it's a seemingly more noticeable secret than its potentially apocalyptic effect on humanity somewhere in Southeast Asia. The virus causes zombie behavior in those affected, and the virus spreads rapidly through a seemingly arbitrary area of ​​land. Our protagonists, unknowingly, wander in the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against the hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be caught halfway between being a zombie gore movie, and an exit and exit. Adventure action, and this confusion is captured more clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular variety without soul, so well represented in the original, and probably the creation of Fulci here. The other main group consists of those that become infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves, but incurred a wild aggressiveness and the desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: jumping indecisively not knowing whether to continue perfecting his technique of superior round house or participate with his brothers in what seems to be a festival of tickling en masse in their hapless victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talents either, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, they hide in rafters and under hay bales and, sometimes, inexplicably, they fall out of nowhere, except heaven. All this is definitely Mattei's work. <br /> <br /> There is a third variety of zombies, more talkative. Apparently, this guy also retains a sense of irony: "I'm very thirsty ... FOR YOUR BLOOD". The ridiculous turn at the end in which the DJ becomes a zombie but continues to preach incoherently about the destiny of humanity, only serves to improve the WTF factor and eliminate any hope of a serious resolution. <br /> <br /> Then there is the infamous zombie head that is propelled slowly through the air, with a joking skeletal smile on its face, as if to say "yes, we know how bad this looks". <br /> <br /> The characters are absolutely one. Dimensions as you would expect. But it is the pseudo comedy dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their situation seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die, he presents an incredibly brave exhibition against an unstoppable zombie threat. In fact, this is the first and perhaps the only time we attacked a real zombie, and one of the only effective scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The boy who played the lead scientist has a heart, but he has no talent, he uses pauses. in its completely random lines, so it ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The attempts of the scientists on the screen to find an antidote are totally unconvincing: "now let's put these two molecules together!" <br /> <br /> However, there are some moments that stand out as really effective. In an early scene, a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room, we faced a hazy vision of a changing figure in the corner and a twisted mass on the floor, all filmed in a diffuse atmospheric light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a quick machete wielding a zombie that destroys everything in its path in its alarming desperation to have it. Its pure aggression is one of the few moments of true horror in the film. The theme of the before and after transmitted through the hotel that hosts the events of the earliest stage of the outbreak, and then as a refuge for our protagonists, is permeated by a humid and dense environment. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a board room that clearly houses hordes of undead, and this is quite tense. Things get more dramatic when they board the hotel without knowing what's upstairs. But this is handled carelessly and is not as effective as it could have been. <br /> <br /> In general, I would say that this film could deserve to be considered a fucking king of a potentially effective tropical zombie festival. , instead of just a bad movie. If nothing else, it has many of the involuntary laughs that I have come to expect from almost anything Italian and bloody from the eighties.
