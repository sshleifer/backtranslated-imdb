The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his relationship with Amelia Earhart's character played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he had been a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but fascinating Hepburn, "he could not help it" and they fell in love. You can say it, because they stare at space and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is. Frankly, this is a terribly old-fashioned movie that is practically impossible to see. Part of the problem is that in the days before the Code, the movies that caused adultery were very common. Furthermore, even if you accept this morally suspect subject, the absolute sappiness of dialogue makes it look like a nineteenth-century romantic novel ... and a very bad one. Sticky and with characters difficult to like (after all, Clive's wife is a good lady and did no harm) make this a great waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this movie is the disguise that Hepburn uses in an early scene where he is dressed in a moth costume! You have to see it to believe it, and she looks like one of the Bugaloos (a dark but appropriate reference).
