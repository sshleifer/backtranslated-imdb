You could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly shows that this statement is incorrect. Most of the characters in this movie lack something to cling to. They play the role of cardboard cutouts that move in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but I will hold back in case someone who is reading wants to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to advance the parts where Jack showed us how to be an unpleasant eater. I must say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I'd rather not spend time watching Jack chew loudly with his mouth open. Personally, I could have dispensed with the references to footwear and jokes that also dot the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> Out of my own personal insanity, the film really lacked something worthwhile. There were innumerable scenes and camera shots that seemed to be dragging. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It's better not to look at this.
