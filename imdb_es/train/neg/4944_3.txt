So, why does this show suck? Unfortunately, that is really the only question, because there is no doubt that it is. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the premise of the show, the series condemned to be short-lived Cavemen focuses on a number of the Neandertals and their struggle to exist in modern America and is based on the characters that appear in a series of television commercials for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there are many reasons to think that it could be executed successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then the slogan of the ads, something similar to the effect "We" is not very different from you ", gave me the key to the success of the program. Although the cave / neanderthal men are actually a different species from humanity, the characters in the title of this show, it turns out, are exactly the same as those of us who are boring imbeciles. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's my experience as a game writer, rather than a California writer based on committees, hackers, but soulless, but this show had a lot of potential, and none of that has been done. They should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, for example, about giving them occupations as a graduate student and store clerk. furniture., when Would they have been more attracted to things like underground utility workers and guides in cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games like squash, when they could devote a whole episode to trying to obtain hunting licenses to go after the game with spears? A program like this could write for itself, and you have to write something badly intentionally to make it so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Another boring aspect of this program is an attempt to portray cavemen as subject to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawn! This has been done many times before, and never sadder than this. And, as noted above, Neandertals are really a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is incomprehensible and out of place. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including those of anyone who wants to tell them. Why am I wrong? I would like to enjoy this program and I regret that I could not do it. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
