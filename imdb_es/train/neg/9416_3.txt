Steve McQueen certainly has many loyal followers. Of course, he was a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic that the big screen has known. But even McQueen can not save the turkey from a movie, filmed with what looks like a brownie-type camera in real locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new guy with no criminal record. of a robbery to a bank by one of the other gang. There is more than a general idea that there is a gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He did not like the other members of the robbery at all, mainly due to his lack of criminal curriculum. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects there's something going on, especially when he starts hanging out with Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all rather rough characters. That would undoubtedly arouse my suspicions. <br /> <br /> The grand theft of St. Louis Bank had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix did not do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided that Steve's performance was better served by doing a bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie may fall like the worst one made by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would have done it if they had seen this. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey.
