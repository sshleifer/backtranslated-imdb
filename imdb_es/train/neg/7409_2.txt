There are some elements that prevent this film from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed by the bad performance, the holes in the plot, the deus ex machina thrown in the in, the stupid dialogues, the weak script and the predictable clichés .. What we have here is a horror movie with a story that goes nowhere most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black man who gets it first (yes, that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland), seems to have trouble trying to leave a mysteriously empty hospital. There are garish ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought that at least they did not use zombies, but they did come), and the Finnish glam rock band with demonic makeup, meddling in their way. There is also a doodle of present time change, but it adds nothing to the story. Autistic girls and vagabonds seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never explain it to the viewer or their confused friends. Its lines consist only of deep thoughts of life lessons like: "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in darkness ..." or the sinister "I need a red crayon ... a red crayon " So all these characters (including the worried father and the sweet doctor in the types of anguish) end up running around the dark floors, and from or to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or group of zombies appears, and if it seems that a demon keyboardist can not detect a group of six people coming towards him, waving a flashlight and talking, he was just pretending. And apparently, this demon can go through the walls without much trouble, but opening the elevator door is beyond his capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even have a turn of the sequence "everything was a dream". Or maybe it was not. Oh, boy, I wish this movie was, and that guy that makes time move faster, so everything develops in just 10 minutes or so ...
