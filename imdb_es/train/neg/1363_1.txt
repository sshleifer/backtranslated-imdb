This movie starts slowly, then goes off. After observing for about an hour, and seeing that absolutely nothing happened, I left. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zipper. Nothing There is no history. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people that any of us knows. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it like a movie. There is no movement. I could have told the same "story" with a couple of still images with subtitles. The script is a joke. It is simply horrible. I doubt that a doctor scriptwriter in the world can save it. What I regret most is not having lost the 60 minutes of my life watching "Love In the Time of Money", but I have lost a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to leave, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I saw about 20 people leave before me.
