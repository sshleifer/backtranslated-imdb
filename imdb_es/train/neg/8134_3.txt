A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert to have a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling through its picnic blanket. He wants to take a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy her honeymoon. She gives in They go on tour, but they let the group go. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. She continues. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know that a bat is approaching; One does it, and it gets in the hair. He fights her, and attacks him, biting her forehead. <br /> <br /> They leave the cave, but when they are in a gondola in a ski resort, they start having attacks in which they have hallucinations or visions of bats that attack people. He gets angry when this happens. He can not drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about the rage, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see parts of the transformation of man into a bat person. It seems that he is not alone in his mind. If the bite of the bat causes these transformations it is not clear, since he already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Although the title seems inappropriate, the implication in the end is that the same thing happens. another person. It's not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of locations in the desert, the caves and the ski slopes, and some of the rarest scenes. I did not think this was as bad as other people do, and I did not think the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think (I rated that with a 5/10).
