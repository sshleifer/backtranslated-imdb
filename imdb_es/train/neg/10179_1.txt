This movie is a disgrace for the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not even believe they left Cleveland. (Yes, I realized at that time that the real Indians were pretty good and that the Twins had taken their place in the bottom of the American League, but they were still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League , I liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally reach the series. You can not tell me that this was not the plan after the second movie was completed. What happened? Anyway, if you're a true fan of the original major leagues, do yourself a favor and do not look at this crap.
