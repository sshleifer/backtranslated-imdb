1st seen 12/7/2002 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): The typical Mary Kate and Ashley eat with a few more kisses. It seems to me that girls are getting very tired of this and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to separate and go their own ways. In this episode of their adventures, they are interns in Rome for a "fashion" designer who places them directly in the mail room to learn what hard work is about (I suppose ...). In addition to the typical flirting with the boys, there is nothing but the stage of Rome until almost the last hour of the film when it is finally revealed why they are fired, rehired, shot again and then hired again . This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation. Maybe the real world is your next adventure (if there is one). Even my children do not seem to mind this boring "adventure" in fantasy. Let's see that they probably only have a couple of years until their legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
