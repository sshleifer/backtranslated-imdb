Ok, simple and simple, if you're a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM THE LEGEND. <br /> <br /> It is, without doubt, the most disappointing TR game so far. It looks very good, sounds very good, but it is totally impossible to play and I have surrendered. I feel that Eidos has stolen me. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 games of Tomb Raider the controls were standard. In AOD they were "sticky", but they were still the same general control sequences. In Legend, her methods of movement and control have completely changed and she is totally uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I have seen comments in other parts from people who say 'Use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamepad'. No, why should I? Others say 'But this has been the standard for third-party controls for years.' Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why mess with it? Oh, I know, because they do not care about their original and loyal loyalty, they want to take advantage of the new guys who had not even heard about the show until the movies came out and they made a lot more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fan is to stay away from this game, and if you buy it, complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other publications, mainly in the forums of Eidos, of people who tell them how silly it is, maybe they listen.
