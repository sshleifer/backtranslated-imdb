This movie has some beautiful scenes and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous as the daughter and is no match for the more mature and nuanced interpretation of Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The conclusion of the feminist trend of the film also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
