Seriously, there is absolutely nothing good in this crap fest at all. Randolph Scott, a homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, finds himself in his most boring and boring role. At 57, he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, although here it does not matter much because Gail Russell looks much older than her 31 years and is very ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking habit. Lee Marvin plays his usual villain role, but it's not enough to save this garbage. Thank God they no longer do westerns, they are only dated, old racist movies that make a glamor of guns and murder. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
