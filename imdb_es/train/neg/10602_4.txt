This movie is mainly bullshit and the only reason why it's worth watching this movie is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme stars in this film. There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. <Br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is so bad and it's the worst performance I've seen, and the 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act in EVERYTHING. And this movie has to be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes, the worst movies he's done and if you see him in one of his great movies, you should see Blood sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> About this whole movie it sucks / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
