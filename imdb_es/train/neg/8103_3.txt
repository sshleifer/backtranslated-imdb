This is possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I do not care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is in Kundera's novel. It is not that it can not be filtered; It's just that, like 99% of your work, it's pretentious and overdrawn. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters come out as if they were looking at the navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynist. I have read many of his works (including his realistic socialist poetry, that was really horrible). I just do not understand what the uproar is about. The characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels make the reading exasperating. In a movie, all the things I do not like about Kundera were magnified. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe this is a Criterion Collection DVD. In no way is this film so essential.
