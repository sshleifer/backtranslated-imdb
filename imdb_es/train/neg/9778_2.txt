I'm sure Operations Dames was one of the favorites in the drive-ins of the time. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you can lose if you were worried. And if you needed to get into the mood for other activities, you had some curvy curves on the screen to get you in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not much that Operations Dames has in its favor. . It is set in the Korean War, where a GI platoon along with a British tommy moves a little and has to return to the UN lines. It's bad enough, but these guys also meet a group of USO girls and their choreographer in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know that the sad thing about this movie is that the generations were slow to be accepted by women. The army and in combat situations. These bimbos of the USO pushed back the liberation of women light years. In fact, even the professional and tough soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can not keep it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But that was probably better to remind some of what they were in the drive-in for. This nameless cast is better if I do not recognize any of them by any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Ladies of Operations is definitely a team failure.
