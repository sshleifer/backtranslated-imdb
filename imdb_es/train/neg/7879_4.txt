First of all, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my ninth grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts some characters and loses many of the main points of the book. It jumps a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If someone were watching this movie without having read the book for the first time, it would be confusing. The most disappointing thing in this movie for me was the ending. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be pigs and men in an alliance and a kind of "fusion", but instead, the movie seemed like the animals rebelled against the pigs. To summarize, I do not think this film captured the real meaning that Orwell described in his book.
