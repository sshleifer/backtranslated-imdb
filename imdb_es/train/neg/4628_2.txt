Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's what this movie was about. Pure exploitation film. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times that they made loops with the original orchestral music. And, of course, music has no relation to the scenes. Case in point: casually entering a room and saying "Hello" was recorded with music of persecution of a Roman epic. I would like to know why this movie was on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is that Misty takes off and puts on her clothes (except for the bra and panties, sadly). It also includes horrendous dubbing, which leads to a "Beware! Godzirra!" effect.
