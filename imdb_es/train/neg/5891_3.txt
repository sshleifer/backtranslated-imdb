This Norwegian movie is very bad, the actors can not act because they seem to be reading a book and the story is so (aspiring) to Hollywood ... the only actor who did a good job was Haavard Lilleheie..3 / 10 If I Want a very good Norwegian movie. Look at Buddy, the great actors and the story of Feelgood 9/10.
