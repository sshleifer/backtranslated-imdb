If Edward Woodward was the movie that was watching this movie, then that's what he would scream in horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but enough is enough. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this. What are the similarities? No. It's not exactly a coincidence that three of the original stars Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars are another great British actor. The main common ingredient in these originals is the British character of the films. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were extravagant English movies with a unique charm / ambience that can not be reproduced in the USA. UU The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult movie than to bastardize it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task even before hitting the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic than other cult films; it challenges the genre, the smart scripts, the category A actors, the musical score, the pieces that defy the description and all the stories that surround the film. <br /> <br /> So here comes a new version. Do not worry No original was damaged in the making of this remake. Some important aspects of history had to be reworked for the modern United States: communications, paganism, virgins. But that's all about the premise. So we give the police a past Nam style trauma complete with flashbacks of shock music for cheap fears. Then, without a cell phone mast on the island that solves the communication, but in the real world this would not happen. The police simply do not disappear. Give him a blood bond for the motivation instead of the clash of beliefs and you will have the remake. The wafer is thin, is not it? <br /> <br /> It's just that everything was placed with a palette. The alterations of the name were simply hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no center of the city to orient itself, only a few houses dotted with a forest and that was it. Willow was just annoyed at not giving any information and Cage was useless to let him get away with it. When you entered the well, you knew that it would be locked. The script was signaled to the end, and you just wanted it to hurry up and finish. The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and I did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> That ending is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrible day. The other ends with a conclusion of post-production type with explanations to all the gross. <br /> <br /> I loved the original, but I went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the movie. . I left grateful knowing that this movie will probably end under a road somewhere just this time, fortunately forgotten forever.
