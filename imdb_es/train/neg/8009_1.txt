In The Lost Son, a private eye searching for a missing man finds a network of child prostitution. This film incorporates all the worst stereotypes you can imagine in the worst case that exists only in the mind of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap. If you have the opportunity to see this, it would be better if you lost yourself.
