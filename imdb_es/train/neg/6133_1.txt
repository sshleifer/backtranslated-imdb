Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot as a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game that consists of being hunted by a group of ninjas, but those ninjas will not have any chance, especially because Cabot is a gymnast! As a whole, Gymkata is a very bad movie, the atrocious acting, the frightening script and a really incompetent direction make the quality inferior to human standards, however, this film is so terrible that it becomes very, really funny. I mean dialogues like "I know I'm going to sleep." or "Ha!, you through!" Just add to the simulated value that Gymkata gets more. In addition, it is (wisely) the only movie that has as a hero a gymnast who finds things to hang in the heat of the moment.
