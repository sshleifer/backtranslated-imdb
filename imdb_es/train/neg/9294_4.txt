As someone who was amazed at the incredible images of "Hero", I was eager to see this film that was considered in the same line, but better. He also had an actress that I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both aspects. I bought the DVD of this movie in sight, and that was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these martial arts movies that fly through the air are pure fantasy, but this story extends far beyond anything remotely credible, it just made me shake my head with disappointing disbelief. . A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? I'm sorry, that goes a little far. In addition, the main male character 'Jin' (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so upset with his dialogue, with a stupid expression and a stupid laugh, which also ruined the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and Incredible action scenes, this story, for me, just did not have an appeal to make it into a movie worth owning.This movie is not my "hero"!
