My girlfriend and I went to see this movie as a "Premiere surprise" that we bought on the ticket to preview a movie before it opened here in Denmark. We sat for the first hour or so and then we left! The objective of the film seemed to be simply to represent the era (and the 54 club), but it did it at the expense of the development of the character, of which there was none, and the plot of which there was little. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> Although the music was good. So, if you like to listen to some good music and fix that mood of the 70s, I think that's fine. But do not expect to get a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
