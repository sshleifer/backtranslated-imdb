Wow, I love and respect almost everything David Lynch has done. However, this film is similar to the first attempt of a filmmaker to make a pseudo art video. <br /> <br /> To give you a couple of examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this one had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "shots towards up "with the roof in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch generally takes pride in his audio, however, in this you can even hear the buzz of the video camera. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that he had something to do with this movie. Unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans to search your website (for hours) just to find this nonsense. I hope so, because at least that idea is fun.
