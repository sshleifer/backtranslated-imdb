Well, when the appearance of Jason Miller (with an aspect even more eroded than in Exorcist IV) is the highlight of an image, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a bit of a country, a bit of rock n 'roll: mix two drunks with money that drags your child everywhere with a dry mummy (in the basement, have you gotten stained with a poop?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad dye job, and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they had developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand, more or less, that they will visit their relatives again. After that ... <br /> <br /> Problem: there are several interesting flashbacks about what I must assume is that his mother was killed in a car bomb (I think). This is never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need the grandmother for? Now, grandma could be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something like that. Maybe you can do something about her. The best they can do is have a tobacco habit. That is all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They take a real elusive character like the husband. Is he a kind of cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can wait for the trust fund he runs for her) or is he against the guy (after all, he has a good haircut and good clothes)? He drinks, hesitates. He is not a bad guy. He is not a good one. But I do not like. Why not DO something with it? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old boyfriend appears. The husband knocks him down. Go back to knock down the husband. (It becomes pretty stupid, but at least THAT character is motivated). <br /> <br /> NOW - she is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could only have married her for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind guy takes our heroine to the basement to show him the mummy of a witch (are you following this?) That can come alive. In fact, you KNOW that she will come alive, the music swells. A little girl lives in the house, takes the tea to the grandmother (opens the door to do so) and provides the grandmother with cigarettes. Periodically, the grandmother leaves. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The husband and wife lose the child in the house, then they lose their bedroom. Uncle cuts his throat in the basement. The protagonist has nosebleeds. The husband drinks. Both drink. Despite all this, the horrible truth that is alluded to in the first voice in excess is: omigod, an abortion when the protagonist was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all this. Ingredients, nobody managed to get a story on the screen. There is no bridge between situations, there is no need to graduate from a mild disturbance to a frightening horror, only long, slow scenes that lead nowhere. Actually, no one should worry, and they had places to go with that aspect: the innocent child in charge of the drunks. the grandmother who could be locked up because she is a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking. She has great hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In summary, there is no plot. Just a bit of random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain coming in and the soundtrack tells us what you need. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh Nice landscape, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
