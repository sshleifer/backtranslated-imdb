A highly unlikely, incredible and incoherent Spanish production about ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The film begins with a woman who kills one of her cats for a girl. Then he begs his lover to take her somewhere on vacation. He calls work and demands that he lose his vacation time and she tells him that he will pay for this. The relevance of this is for anyone who guesses the end of the film, because the guy, a dark photographer, spies on a beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror movies that seems, taking off the bikini top momentarily to to be able to take a picture, ask She went to lunch, and then to her assignment to Witches Mountain, for reasons we will never meet again. Before leaving, Patty must go through the house and, loudly, "mysterious singing" echoes in the ears of our hero. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with these two stopping at an inn, going to the mountain, and finally understanding why the mountain is called Monta√±a de Brujas. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has some atmosphere, some of the actors are really good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old lady), the protagonists are at least adequate and the climax, although it does not make any sense at all, is well choreographed (Literally) with the witches in white bras and long black hair. However, it does not make any sense, and that is a great detractor for me. I was able to watch the movie another ten times and I still do not know more now than after the first time I saw it. That is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long list of atmospheric and cheap European horror films that covered that decade. If you can get more out of it than me, better be able to you.
