John Heder was absolutely horrible in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad guy from college perform for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was at the height of the course, it's not good, but it's not horrible (besides it's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only one who saved in this movie (although it was also a bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> In general, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will always be stuck in the role of 'the dorky kid', unless he does SERIOUS work in his acting skills.
