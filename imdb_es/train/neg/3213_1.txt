Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I experienced a movie that literally did not have meat or potatoes. The whole movie felt like it was just the salad without a main course. The line of the story was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was outside the window, and the animation was made by four-year-olds. Does that cover it? I have never been more ashamed of a concept in my entire life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the aspect of the other comments I am not mistaken with my observation. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the story moved too fast. For someone new to this character and in these situations, I needed to create more reasons instead of finding the solution. I have seen other Anime (if you could call this Anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing reserved for Lady Death. In a few short scenes, we watch her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive beast of hell. It was hard for me to swallow this, considering moments before she presented herself as this weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, she is immersed in hatred and can fight against an existence that has existed for millions of years. This was absurd. The presentation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least. I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge in mind. For me, it just did not work. She was nothing more than a sweet-eyed prepubertal kid who wanted to spy on the massive amounts of skin that suddenly grew on her chest when she trained with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick just looking at her. The same goes for the character of Cremator. Who was this person at random? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was left with babbling more incoherent than the real development. It is a very sad day in hell when we renounce the characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Next, there was Lucifer himself. Let me say that I think I could fight against the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was laughable, and it simply did not represent the image I had in my mind. It was as if Disney had control and wanted to make it semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and the corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of hell, but a simple lackey who had a bigger place to live. Speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in hell? That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most of the characters worried about dying, when they did not even consider the option that they were already dead. That's how they got to hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the movie for me. I just did not get the idea that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but could that be me? or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. Nothing was built, it was only prepared. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt as if it had been done in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive in the way this movie was drawn. Why are we, America, so behind in the animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's creeping into hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie was bad. The animation along with the horrible voice work was cheap. It's been a long time since I had this film in production, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card. The production was horrible, as was the story. Nothing developed, leaving huge gaps in the plot that almost all fell. The strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. I lost my time with this and I would like to warn others so that when Death arrives, you will not find yourself in my state and regret the fact that you have lost 80 minutes with this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of *****
