This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like an "assigned task" for a film class. The brand is totally lost when it comes to the "message" that is TRYING to retransmit. The characters are exaggerated, they act badly and as for a plot ... well, it's absolutely ridiculous. The cover photo is what made me think it could be a decent movie, the co-actor is handsome and that's it. Moral of this movie: NEVER JUDES A MOVIE FOR ITS COVER! Save time, money and energy and make your own home movie and it will be much better than me. It was painful to see and, frankly, it surprises me that someone spends money to do it and distribute it!
