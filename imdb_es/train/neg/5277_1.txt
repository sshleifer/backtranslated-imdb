I caught this on Showtime tonight and I was surprised how a movie with such an interesting premise could end up being so incredibly horrible. WHO IS YOUR DADDY? He stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school student Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire that his biological parents left him. Although the premise seems that the movie could be very funny, it is ruined by the inept direction of the first director Andy Fickman, a clich√© and predictable script, and a performance that is even bad for direct video standards. Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert becomes a surprisingly sad performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this fool and without grace. 1/10
