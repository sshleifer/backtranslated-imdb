Why make a show that millions of us saw and love as children and make a complete joke about it? They ask why Hollywood is not making the money it used to make. Because they take out garbage and pay the actors large amounts of money to be garbage men and they ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good guys from IL 'come out winning. It was not Gone with the Wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not think of anything original, so they take something that's good and ruin it for a bit of $$$. I just hope that this movie does 10 times less than what it cost to do. The only ones who have fun with this shit are the ones who handled General Lee. The public is the victim. <br /> <br /> Do not see it, watch the replays of the television program. They continue to endure 20 years later.
