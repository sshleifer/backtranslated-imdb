I watched 3/4 of this movie and I wondered why I received such horrible reviews here. It was quite easy to see (at 3am). He had a good cast: the role of Kevin Dillon of the serial killer sociopath was very credible: it was charasmatic and chilling. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple can not conceive, so they go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociopathic donor of "genetic material" looks at the recipients and, in the typical form of a bully, intrudes on their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movie was pretty good ... we see "Conan" growing up. More and more obsessed with raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course, things do not work for him the way he planned. It is not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> But, the last 15 minutes were just horrible. I'm quite tolerant of movies (especially at 3 am!) ... but I was surprised at how badly the ending was written. In fact, I mocked loudly! <br /> <br /> In general, it's not the worst movie I've seen, but I could not see it again (unless it skipped the end). The only quality of redesign here was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers in history. <br /> <br /> Try looking at the other channels before seeing this ... But, if there is nothing better, I would like it. try it ... =)
