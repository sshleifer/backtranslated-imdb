Tom is listening to one of those old radio transmissions, something that children from the 50s to today would see on television. However, they did not make television when this caricature was made, so people got their entertainment, from comedies to music and scary stories, to the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally trembling in his boots listening to a story about the "ghost". Actually, he is literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "the hair stands on end, the chills run down his spine, the heart beats in his throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, watches Tom and laughs at him. - Cat antics. <br /> <br /> Then, we tried what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for problems, that's one thing, but when he is dealing with his own affairs and Jerry is physically abusing him (and in this case, mentally), I find it very difficult to encourage the "little one". <br /> <br /> These early efforts of T & M were also a minute longer than everything that followed. Sometimes that minute makes the difference. He did it here since this actually dragged on for a while. It could have been reduced to five minutes without losing anything because the sketches lasted too long. That's usual for Tom and Jerry. In general, they are much faster.
