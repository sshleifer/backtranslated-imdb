This is undoubtedly one of the strangest movies ever made, even for Fellini. About the only stranger is his SATYRICON. This is a journey of two and a half hours through a strange world of nightmares of decadence, opulence and sexual defiance. Sutherland makes Casanova curiously unattractive and the strange events in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the autobiography of the great lover fail to attract the viewer. Art direction and costume design are, however, outstanding. The Academy failed to even nominate the first, but justice was done by rewarding an OSCAR for the second. Also nominated (strangely) was the unconnected script, meaningless and almost inaccessible. Go figure!! The video movie is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original execution time. This viewer was grateful.
