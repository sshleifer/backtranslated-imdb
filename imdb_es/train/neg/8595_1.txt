Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are excellent actors, who can certainly face any challenge they may face. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Watching the Detectives (2007)" offers only one for both actors and audiences: not falling asleep during a boring, predictable and unimaginative story. <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' tries to be funny, but the comedy is forced, very badly directed and shameful on the verge of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After a third of the movie, still nothing that can catch even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and family, is even hinted at, not to mention that it's really happening. . <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who liked it faked it or had to pretend like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed him an old black and white movie that did not matter to him. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is not close to category B, it is between Q & R, as -Questions? and - Play the questions! The director knows what he is doing! Well, if his goal was to bore the viewer, he has done a very good job! <br /> <br /> 'Observe the detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur PLEASE, do not let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 of 100.
