For those who want to see this movie? I would say: come on! Without the narration it could be a very good film / documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the story lines implemented make it very difficult to see a skeptical person like me. After several animals, his life in several seasons gives the feeling that it is an animal soap that we are observing. But the melodramatic point of view does not allow me, also, if a predator finally meets a prey (an exception is there), the camera moves away or jumps to another scene. I wonder why this happens, if they had to show reality, why cut scenes of a melodramatic fairy tale? I believe that morality is important for the mass of the crowd, because after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
