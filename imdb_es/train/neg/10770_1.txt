It may contain possible spoilers (not that anything in this movie is new or even surprise you a little) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they have done until oblivion? Surely it's cheaper for them, but after a while, do not you think that the overall quality and the way people think of them would decrease? House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crosses that make no sense at all. Some of the signs of total disregard for the previous films are: The voices do not even remotely match and Iago is evil again (Since when?) I know these movies are directly for the children, but there was a time when everyone could Enjoy Disney movies. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) reeked. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even the youngest ones. All I can do is that if more of these films of the same caliber are released, it is only a matter of time before a small animation studio surpasses Disney in general quality.
