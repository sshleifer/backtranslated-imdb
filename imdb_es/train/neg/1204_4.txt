I remember Devil Dog was playing at TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends were watching and laughing the next day. It is not so bad for a horror movie made for television, but it is derived (mainly from The Exorcist) and professional, for lack of a better word. It will not leave you stunned with an artistic cinematography or a great performance, but neither is it a waste of time. It's the kind of movie you see to kill a couple of hours when you do not feel like thinking too much. <br /> <br /> However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you will not. To be disappointed. The first scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with the eyes of Children of the Damned, are hilariously non-threatening, and the blue screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) Are quite complicated . And keep an eye out for the Satanist cloaked in Maverick tones to the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's not a great horror movie in any sense of the imagination, but I would like you to still do things like this for television.
