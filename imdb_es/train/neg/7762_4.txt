Considering that John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, he expected his pilot to be quite interesting. However, I probably had too many expectations because I was quite disappointed. First, they turned the protagonist into a monster who had the crazy idea of ​​showing his incredible knowledge before an audience in a public area. So after that scene I started worrying that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse because none of the other characters were introduced correctly. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less intriguing. I was also a bit disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I discovered that he was not a credible John Doe. Another problem was the police history. It really felt like a déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. It brings us to the worst problem of the group, the episodic format. I could already see the fillings one after the other. <br /> <br /> So, in general, I was very disappointed and I do not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was, I now understand why the program was canceled. Somehow I have the impression that he did not reach his goal, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The production quality was also quite good and the casting was correct. But I will never know if it improved, probably not, because I do not plan to see the next episode.
