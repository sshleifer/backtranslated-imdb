When I heard the plot of this movie I just had to see it, I mean entire cities that were eliminated by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is as much fun as possible. <br /> <br /> Directed by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes off his SCUBA suit and Lieutenant Finletter who is never In the picture, without his parachute behind, ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B-Movies, particularly the Japanese horror of the 1950s. The film begins with the discovery of a standard-sized tomato by a woman who washes in the kitchen before we we find in the middle of a crime scene, since the tomato supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you that there is nothing more sensible, as the movie progresses! To be fair, there are a couple of funny moments, example, any time that the Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa says that his voice is dubbed with an American accent, or when the costume expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes, can anyone pass the ketchup? probabl He was much more fun in 1978, with everything as bad as his good concept. Unfortunately for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes', fake films like 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' have been released and have made this kind of comedy much better since then. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious; there is no continuity in the editing and it feels really slow and without energy. For a parody movie to work, it is necessary that many things happen at once, a gag after it ends. The singing in the movie seems useless and the ads for the furniture store that appear on the screen are very strange, even for this movie. Ultimately, however, you can see why this movie is cult; I can not see many people who are indifferent. Unfortunately terrible would be the way I would summarize it.
