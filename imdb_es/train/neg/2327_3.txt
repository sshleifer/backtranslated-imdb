This movie comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This producer gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror films. The most famous disasters in his work are "subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and Doctor Mordrid is not, either. The hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his movie. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly silly and cheesy and almost humorless. I only saw it because it's starring Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you are a fan of it. For every good movie, it seems that he has made 5 inferiors. Anyway, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers. A good one that has been here for 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and a bad one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason that I have already forgotten. Combs receives his instructions from the mentor. That "boy" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. Very very corny, that's it! Every once in a while a blinding flash of light appears on the screen, but that's the only special effects form that this movie has. All this is just a piece of complaints and annoyances and when the two wizards finally face each other, it is over before you know it ... I would have expected the evil magician to at least defend himself a bit, but nooooooo ... In some scenes, you can really detect some originality and creativity (like, for example, Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you can even find some very small but nice aspects (like the Raven named Edgar Allen) but in general, it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he does not have to put on a stupid jersey for that.
