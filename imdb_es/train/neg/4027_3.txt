This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correctness make it really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like that, and good movies show complex characters with impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this movie is the father of Bola's friend. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattooists with shaved heads are not always bad, in fact, they can be better than the average dad (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something like that). Thanks, Achero. I will propose you for the Nobel Prize in literature.
