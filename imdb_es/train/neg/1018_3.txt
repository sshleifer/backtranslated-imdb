There is an excellent reason why Edison went straight to the video: he would have landed in the movie theaters with a thud. The film lasted too long and was dangerously boring. Just one notch above lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next movies), the bad guys are so ridiculous and the action is as non-existent as the performance of Justin Timberlake. I hate hitting the boy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his strong point, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not so bad ... only for the most part. I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be an opportunity to be the leader. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is also almost always nice (you can watch him swallow several times while chewing the stage), and Freeman has the ability to raise this movie to three stars (out of ten ... not so good). /> <br /> When all is said and done, the last mistake of this movie is that it is a mundane and boring piece of pseudo-action Poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. Nor does he get anyone to give him a good shit about any of the characters. In general, it's just boring. That said, rent this when you're suffering from insomnia.
