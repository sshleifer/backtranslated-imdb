A couple moves to the house of their dreams, not knowing that this and their neighbors have been built on land that used to be used as cemeteries. It is said that the film was based on a true story, although it is not revealed how much of it is supposed to be true. The plot is not unique, see Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). In a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: from the disturbing ones (mysterious shadows, the grave illness of the daughter) to the downright ridiculous ones: the toilets that are washed continuously and the doors of the garages get out of control. There is little depth in history: once it has been established that the earth had been used as a cemetery, we learn nothing more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well drawn nor are they memorable in any way, nor is the atmosphere especially special. The movie could be annoying for some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from her.
