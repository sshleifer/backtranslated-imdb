This movie started well, I felt I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Too quickly I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. The whole performance was excellent, but only a few scenes had brief moments in which they were really fun. Dan Cortese was incredible. I loved him in this role. Your agent should show this movie to the casting agents. Look at the first scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found this in a container in a video store. It cost me two dollars and due to the notoriety of this movie, I think it was a good price.
