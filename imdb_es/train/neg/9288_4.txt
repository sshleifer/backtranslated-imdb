Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the lead role was a great success of B. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct sequel to the video, an action movie with nothing to lose, but no ability to win anything. It is less entertaining than the first: in all aspects. But while it is worth a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; If you also like to see the old stars of the WWE on the screen or even if you like to see the sequels, even if they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he is not made for work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the work, but nothing surprising, not far from being well. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can not be excellent. The cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Whatever, just look at it if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
