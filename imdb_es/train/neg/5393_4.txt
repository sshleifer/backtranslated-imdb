I'm a Shakespeare fan, and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh has done to make Shakespeare come back for a new generation of viewers. However, this film fails to convey the general intentions of the work with ridiculous musical sequences. Add that to Alicia Silverstone's slip on the dialogue (which reminds Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other misunderstood roles, all this amounts to unbearable visualization resistance.
