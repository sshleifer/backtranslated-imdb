I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would play as a writer / director. I could not have been more disappointed by this movement. The film was so disjointed and the cinematography was over to the point where I wanted to remove the plug from the wall. The actors were very good, but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors are made to be writers or directors, and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've seen in my 50 years, this is the worst movie of all. Please do us all a favor, Mr. Hopkins and stick to the performance, in which you are excellent, and leave the writing and direction to those who have talent in those areas. If I could give this film a grade lower than one, I certainly would.
