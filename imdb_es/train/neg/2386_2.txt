I missed this film at the movies, but I had an idea in the back of my head that it was worth seeing, so when I saw it on DVD shelves I thought "it was time to see it". Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, probably one of the worst movies in history. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Maybe it would have made more sense if I had read Robbins' novel, but unless the movie is completely different from the novel, and with Robbins helping with the script, I doubt it, the novel would also have to be an unbearable read. br /> <br /> I hope the actors were well paid, as they seemed embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more recently on DVD, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to seem uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Save about 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, like cutting your toenails or sorting your sock drawer. Even when you see it in the disposable container of "less than $ 5" at your local store, resist the temptation!
