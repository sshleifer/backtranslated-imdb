Should any good story be "improved" with added Broadway music? Apparently, those who can not create their own plots think that classical literature is there for looting. I confess that Oliver Twist and other similar stories are not my favorites, since it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that left him quite perplexed, and this was a great example of that ... So, of course, take this seriously history. and add nauseating music and camp with all the characters, from the orphaned children jumping to the bobbies and, suddenly, is it encouraging? Argh. Bring me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my classification come from the casting, which I can compare to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a game version could be proud of, but then they should go and have them sing (see the complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here could do it and fortunately saved us the voice of singer Oliver Reed (sorry if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is I 'said. Why embarrass everyone, except the truly shameless, by putting funny songs in a perfectly good story? This has rarely been done with good results. It usually ruins the story. He did it with this one. The jury still does not know if it is worth saving this story, but with all that deception, it is impossible to say.
