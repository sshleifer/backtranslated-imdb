First, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then, get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival hype. After all, who needs people who have spent years perfecting their craft? Then, hire a director of photography who does not know how to illuminate. You see, if it is well lit, it will not look "real" and the festival will not like it. Who needs to have professional level photography anyway? Then hire a ten-year-old boy who has never had a camera to be his operator. It will give your film the completely amateur touch that the festival analysts will confuse with "reality" and guarantee that, even though you will empty the seats of real, critical people and a small part of the over-intellectualized audience will shout "genius" because they will not believe that this was only one hour of complete amateur. <br /> <br /> Once you've done that, buy your ticket to the Sundance Bad Movies Festival. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste
