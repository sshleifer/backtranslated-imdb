It's hard to put into words the almost boiling hatred I have of this movie. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was an outburst, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and stereotypes were beyond the norm, if they were not offensive to Americans of Italian descent . <br /> <I'm not saying that the performance was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. Al, he did well. But ... almost all the characters in the movie I despised. Not since The Bonfire of the Vanities I have not liked all the characters on the screen.
