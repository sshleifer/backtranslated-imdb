It is difficult to say what was the worst of this program: the bad performance, the bad acoustics of different parts, the bad CGI, the inadequate sets for the period, the bad script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original story a little closer: there is enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a lot of good material, and a better storyline, than the writers could find. <Br /> <br /> And why introduce a new strange weapon like a crossbow that shoots explosive beams? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was made in "only" 21 days. It shows in the lack of quality. I'm starting to think that this is a general attitude (bad) taken by the science fiction channel (and others) when it comes to making movies with classic stories in recent years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
