This movie was not made by Who's fans. Most of the great moments that fans expect in the half hour of Tommy Medley are simply overlooked or overlooked: At Christmas, they did not show Daltry's screams after the line "Tommy does not know what day is ... ", showed almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excessive audience shots in the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're not going to take (Listening to You), we stole almost all the Pete guitar chord shots. Huge pieces of the film are filmed from the back of the band. It's a very frustrating movie to watch, and it does not deliver the products. I do not know if director Murry Lerner is not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if * he * is * a Who fan and this is all that the eight cameras can offer him. To your credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some favorites, which are very well filmed, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. This might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you're not anticipating Tommy. The sound in general was mediocre in the transmission I saw from DirecTV; It can be different in video or DVD.
