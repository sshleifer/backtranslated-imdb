An interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses the opportunity to save the life of an enemy girl and is obsessed with this event, even though he saved many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is mainly run by police officers who patrol corridors, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, the high school is a prison and most children pay too little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides that he will stop teaching and go to another field. However, the principal asks you to have a detention class as your last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the movie when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete PUMP. Try to enjoy it, if you decide to see it!
