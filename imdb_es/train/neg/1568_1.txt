Calling this anything would be an insult to everything else. Some expletives could describe it, but in a very positive way. Normally, one ignores this type of garbage, but it was so stupid that one can despair. I would have thought that even Americans and commercial television stations would not have missed it. But as the Germans say: Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens!
