This series is getting worse and worse. Wrongly written and just not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines. By striving so hard to offend anyone, they end up insulting everyone. Now, in the second season, the desperate cast stopped shaking their arms and resorted to that condescending and presumptuous style "Oh, fool" that comes with a script of not laughing. They roll their eyes and shake their heads, as if to say, are not we crazy? Is not this funny? Well, no, it really is not. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come on, CBC, you're supposed to be our leader station showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug in this amateur mess.
