Please, do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this is not the case. Usually, I'm going to stupidity if it's funny, but this stupidity was so stupid that almost (or possibly it did) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never really be an impediment to watching a horror movie, but add this amazing cast (tearful), and you will have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his friend. Family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his girlfriend in his office. On the way, they meet a woman in distress, who is then invited by the other girls. <br /> <br /> The stay in the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a pile when one The girl disappears and strange objects appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From there, you (the audience) and the idiots, uh, actors, try to figure out what's going on and soon they start distrusting each other. In general, I think I've made it sound better than it is. The main fight with this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot devised, the bad performance and the clueless motivations. Again, this could be forgivable, it was a bit funny, but unfortunately, it is not. <br /> <br /> The end of the turn is just a turn in which nobody would guess it just because if you really thought about it. The movie would not have made sense anyway. Please, do not let this review stop you from seeing the astonishment of this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight inches).
