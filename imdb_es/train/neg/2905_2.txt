The expectations were a bit high for me when I went to see this movie, after all, I thought that Steve Carell could not be wrong to leave big movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'll start with what's right with this movie: at certain points, Steve Carell can be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it is almost entirely due to the fact that they gave him the maneuver room to do his thing. He is an undoubtedly talented individual, and it is a pity that he has committed himself to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train crash. <br /> <br /> With that out of the way, I'll discuss it What went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a column of syndicated councils nationwide. Prepare your girls for a family reunion, where their relatives meet for a while. <br /> <br /> The family is at the top of the list of things that make this a horrible movie. No family behaves like this. It's almost as if they had been transported from Pleasantville or left to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we believe is a family when we are 7 years old. It gets to the point where they become hateful and just frustrating. Touch football, crossword competitions, family bowling and talent shows are NOT HOW PEOPLE WORK. It's almost disgusting. <br /> <br /> Another big flaw is the woman who is supposed to be falling in love with Carell. Watching her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman is presented as a bit delayed. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After continuing to think, I do not think it was much.
