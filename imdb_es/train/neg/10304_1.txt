Here, let me move my hands over the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad you're going to ask for. Again and again, it works like an amulet: it's a genius, how does it work? my nonsense detector goes crazy, even if I pass this program when I'm scanning channels, I have to be very careful (these days is useful too often, so I do not need to break into an idiotic shit like this ... beware with that remote control!). Is this supposed to be a fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of a man's control and domination? or what? Why does it exist? <br /> <br /> this is the most insane, completely incredible and artificial show, and I can not understand why it is still in the air. so geeks can give MUCH better shows at such a difficult time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give a pass to this nonsense drens. Programs like Firefly (if there were any like that) disappear after a season, but nonsensical things like this that do not make any logical sense keep moving forward. yeccch.
