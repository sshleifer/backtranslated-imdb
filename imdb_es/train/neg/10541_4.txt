I jotted down some notes here in THE FIRST POWER, the 1990 serial satan killer Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips yuppie hell-fest ... 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and Can serve time in prison. I just hope I can find Armani's prison clothes to go in style: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is to see his police detective dressed in $ 4500 designer coats, a $ 7300 designer silk suit and see your $ 3500 / month in Los Angeles Bachelor Party Loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The protagonist Tracey Phillips has a beautiful porcelain skin, red hair that always flows with a style even when mistreated, and incredible breasts that are very bright. in the second half of the film, made by a silk jersey designer who sadly remains in place on his torso, even when he was being prepared to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic assassins stripped their victims before eliminating them, although there is something to be said to leave the imagination a little. In the last 10 minutes of the movie, I could only think about what her breasts would look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychics living in Los Angeles can pay $ 4 million dollars in condos on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a vision that would make Brad Pitt decide he was mistreating him. In fact, the condo used in this movie is exactly the same as seen in MULLHOLLAND DR. From David Lynch, who at least had the good sense to turn a condominium resident into a successful film director. The only Professional Psychics I have found outside of this movie are serving prison sentences for electronic fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his "How's it going?" "Buddy Boy?" The line could be the phrase from the most-watched movie by high since "THANKS FOR THE TRIP, MRS!" from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Beneath the main metropolitan cities there are huge acid tanks simmering that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lighter Zippo lighter on them, which is why all The main public water plants have No signs of smoking stuck everywhere, although the idea that smoking is dangerous in the water is, of course, absurd. And since Zippo lighters must be filled manually with a lighter fluid that can often seep through and be absorbed by clothing, the thought of carrying one in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk suit seems much more dangerous to me. <Br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are impressive, at least, and one of the fun things to watch is that you're not watching computer-assisted special effects, but real people who risk their lives and limbs to contribute. a film that got almost universal ratings from the critics' BOMB when it was released. <br /> <br /> 7) The Satanists in the movies always surprise me: Here is a guy who has taken advantage of a Luciferian bid for power and yet, instead of using it to do something useful like getting rich or doing that the fashion models get involved in sexual relations with him, instead, he owns bag ladies and makes them levitate out of people's apartments. Speaking of which, here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly and is able to put his being inside the bodies of other people. However, he forces star Lou Diamond Phillips with a fist fight at the conclusion of the film, but does not have the opportunity to do so. It is sensible to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And so on ... Be watched in the company of wise friends while they consume beer. You'll have fun while you firmly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
