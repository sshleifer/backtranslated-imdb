And when I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love the peculiar, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so damn B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and worthy to yawn. She also totally lacks something humorous. The expressionless way in which he tries to deliver his lines is dead on arrival because it is simply not funny. I saw two segments of her program and she was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Caramba, my daughter (19 years old) saw her promotions on Comedy Central and said she was a "dumb girl". I thought it was a compliment. The one that says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog" is really believable. I know she wants to be a comedian. She just appeared as a crazy deformed. I just do not want to see her near MY dog.
