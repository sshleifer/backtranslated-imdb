I'm not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at all better. However, it seems that every time a type of movie is released, a second must be approximately at the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is really Twister, except it's worse and with mundane special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they were not great, it was the movie itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole story was too weird to play it. A series of tornadoes hits a city and basically the film is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I really do not know why it seems that the duplicates of disaster films are released almost in tune with each other, but this would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
