Haha It's not a bad way to start. I thought this was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of the new 1976 version of KING KONG. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. The funky disco music of the movie will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the theme song of the movie by the Yetians. This is the worst creature effect I've seen. At the same time, this film is still a holy grail of series B movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the power of Yeti." I remember seeing this movie in MOVIE MACRABE presented by Elvira. There is a scene where it was like KING KONG upside down! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and goes up to the building, but in this movie, he goes downstairs and grabs the girl (who was falling). Also around that year there was another clone of KONG MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) that came from Hong Kong. There are many matte scenes that travel and motorized body parts. This movie will leave you laughing. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. Classified PG for violence, language, thematic elements and some scenes of fear.
