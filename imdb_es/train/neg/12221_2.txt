With the exception of sound, none of the above is really a criticism for this kind of film without a budget, (really) independent of terror. The effects of makeup and gore are very good and the main actor was effective, the main actress, although attractive, needs a bit of coaching, since she was particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is its duration, at 108 minutes it is half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie, as for the plot, only about ten minutes of the first fifty are relevant . <br /> <br /> In some places it is visually appealing and, sometimes, the lack of lighting works in the movies. favor. However, when this is combined with poor sound, as with most movies, it is difficult to see large sections. <br /> <br /> This certainly could be an entertaining and unoriginal movie, like the "serial killer of death". with a judicious and ruthless edition, in its current form it is played as an unfinished rough cut.
