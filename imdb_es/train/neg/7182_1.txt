I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this piece of worthless nonsense (trust me, double negatives are required here, it's so bad). This movie was in trouble for the initial credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the composer. The musical numbers are too long and none of them is good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly take the strings used by Scrooge in the strange hell sequence of the movie instead of sitting in this insult to the musicals of the film again. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this movie (completely involuntary by the way) has to do with Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly white dust disguise, Guinness brushes through his scenes in what was an attempt to make it look like he was floating like a ghost, or to show his total disdain for having to be in this terrible movie. Meanwhile, Albert Finney combines the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly disgusting Quasimodo / Scrooge character. Finney's Scrooge is such a frightening person that it is impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this abomination of cinema at all costs.
