'A Smile LIke Yours' is a pathetic comedy that does not really make sense. I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the whole argument is based on one thing: the desperate and expensive failed attempts of a couple to conceive children. The people who made a great effort must have forgotten the option of adoption, to which this film is not kind. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction to all that the women's liberation movement offers. , exhibiting almost no sense of independence. She is a pretty boring character like the dreamy housewife with absolutely nothing else in her mind than having children. Like a stupid romantic comedy of the 50s, Greg Kinnear is his host presenter who does not show personality, nor independence, and we do not care. <br /> <br /> They are the two most boring and, often, annoying characters, and it hardly creates themes for a comedy that presents itself with many setbacks, which should arise from a couple who do everything possible to get pregnant. Except that they really do not do anything, except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own (except for the in vitro fertilization number). The plot hardly allows mishaps, because well, the couple does nothing to create a strange situation. They only go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> The secondary plots are intended to prove the fidelity of the couple, a necessary moral element of the story, since the couple plans to conceive children together. Jennifer works in a new age store with her friend (played by Joan Cusak), and they are in the business of developing aphrodics. Christopher MacDonald plays the interested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a good price for her and her friend's product. The secondary argument barely offers much to keep you interested (although Joan Cusak is quite funny at the restaurant scene). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect, who finds the opportunity to earn some extra money to cover the clinic's bills, by accepting a job in Seattle, where his boss is the rude seductress ( also another desperate, helpless female character) who tries to influence Danny (as silly as he is) to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I do not mind giving away). Jill Hennesy is good on paper, but her character is too predictable and too much formulated as a necessary element to create conflict for Danny. It's stupid and, once again, hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is completely boring, and almost unfunny (except for the restaurant scene and the airline's flight). The plot does not offer anything that is really striking. Even if the story were entirely about two people trying to conceive, the writers could have discovered several hilarious setbacks to develop from that. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silhouettes of silly comedies from the 1950s with a happy wife and a clueless husband. Then, even without setbacks in the plot, the characters themselves offer nothing interesting, much less fun. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusak should have been in the lead and someone else should have taken the role of Kinnear. Cusak would have made even a lousy story outrageously funny (as he sometimes does in his role as co-star here). This is definitely one to let go.
