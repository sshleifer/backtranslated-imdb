I do not know the author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is a typical example of her work, she probably would not have had much interest in her books as a child. When I was a kid I was not really interested in the literature, unless there were soldiers fighting against monsters with a high body count. <br /> <br /> Judging from this film version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I guess Pearce write for more Middle-class children, since much of the story revolves around the protagonist Tom Long, they move to a house without a garden and, suddenly, find a metaphysics. Undoubtedly, having a garden of your own was something that working class people did not have in the 1950s, so I suppose there is some subtext of a political class somewhere. There is also a romance that involves a young woman named Hattie, but again, are there love stories loved by cynical children? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little emotion or adventure occurs within the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a film for children that seems dated by its origin. He is harmless, but I am surprised by his high rating of IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given him so many high notes if they were 10 years old children who had just seen the trilogy of the LORD OF THE RINGS.
