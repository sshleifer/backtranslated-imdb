Another example of why Stepehn King books should not become movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in adapting the book to the screen). The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an elderly gypsy. In court, with the help of the judge and the head of the local police, he gets off, even though the accident was his fault as he was not paying attention while driving. The father of the dead gypsy puts a curse on the 3, and our main character, Billy (the lawyer) becomes increasingly thin. Although the film was kept with the book, for the most part, and has its typical King ending, the performance was forced and felt forced. We go from one scene to the next without much of anything in the middle, something like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the film (something like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should remain that: the authors. Leave the performance to the actors. It's not like anyone in this movie was so good. I have seen the main characters in the movies where they were much better.
