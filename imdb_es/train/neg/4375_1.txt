Less shy and less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is worth seeing (at least once). <br /> <br /> Sleazy snapshotters escorts aspiring actresses / models for a remote home in the woods to sexually abuse them. Unfortunately (for the hot guys), a long-lived demon, who lives in the forest, has already addressed the girls for fun. <br /> <br /> The thing even ends up having fun with the boys, that is IF it considers "bewitching" the beheadings, the dismemberment and the masturbation with cut limbs. <br /> <br /> Once again, everything sounds better on paper than it sounds and sounds in the movie. <br /> <br /> Like Komizu shattered LIVING DEAD IN TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also manages this effort and is only saved by a bold violence and some great white shots. <br /> <br /> However, do not buy the hype, or you "I will be very disappointed.
