Twin brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) met twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and recover their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact lasts two hours and basically does not add a real focus to the plot of Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, although it is appropriate since the evil twin brother is as embarrassing as the good twin brother. In addition, the action sequences are not as exciting this time and Jean-Claude relies more on the shots than on his martial arts. In addition, the cast of support is wasted and, at two hours, the film is simply boring. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
