I chose to watch this movie because it got a good score here in IMDb. But many people have very bad taste or someone has been fixing the score. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and crazy as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot, but here it goes: it felt as if someone had been thinking: "Would not it be great to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then, the snakes for some? Would she go crazy and start biting and those things?!? "And that's it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. Snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners in a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone). The acting is bad, and all the people are incredible types of stereo. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life: get away!
