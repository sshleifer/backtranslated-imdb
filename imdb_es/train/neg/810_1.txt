If you're one of the people who finds the great TV comedy of "According to Jim," this is going to shake up your world. And I might add, congratulations for demonstrating that a good talent, a good copywriting and a charismatic star are all you need in any network other than ABC, which prefers to launch like Jim Belushi's program year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big, smoky, brown "thank you" of German shepherd size, by all the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what the fans of that film and the younger Belushi deserve. Jim's comic abilities and project choices are never far behind his ability to cut a blues standard. Look for him to try to show all his different talent gaps in every project he throws to the public like a pet peeve chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
