Yes, The Southern Star presents a quite forgettable title melody sung by heavy singer Matt Monro. Quite sets the tone for this swollen and quite boring feature, incredibly poorly known with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of wildlife footage, and a badly composed and boring photograph of Raoul Coutard, and end with a completely inexplicable flutter through the jungles of Senegal.
