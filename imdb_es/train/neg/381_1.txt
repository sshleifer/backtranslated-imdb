This film is the traditional Bollywood fare in terms of the power of the stars, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the absurd idea of ​​the creators of surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family that wants to have a child) is not a surrogate mother. Neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen films and TV shows from India that were made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely unlikely. I realize that most Bollywood films are not made to be plausible, but neither are they meant to be. This movie wants me to emote along with the characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous and artificial conflict. I would have expected something better from Abbas and Mustan.
