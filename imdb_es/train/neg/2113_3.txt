The brides die on the altar and their corpses disappear. Nobody knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) points out that each bride was carrying a strange orchid and that she is going to interview her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to support his young man. <br /> <br /> The corpse disappears. An interesting premise and a short execution time so you can not get bored. Unfortunately, although it starts pretty well, it starts crawling before the midpoint and becomes quite boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it: Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful countess, soft, distant and very creepy; And I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It keeps a little Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But in general, I simply did not manage to maintain my interest through the whole image, and for that, I have to poorly qualify it.
