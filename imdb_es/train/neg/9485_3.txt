Because others have taken the trouble to summarize the plot, I would like to mention some points about this movie. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to filter them. <br /> <br /> - Given the low budget of the movie, the design of the creature was quite good. Actually, it's good to see a direct horror movie that is not plagued by horrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of the digital film is pretty grainy in some places, and it is most noticeable in the well-lit white rooms of the asylum. <br /> <br /> - The ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this movie, not to mention the variations over time. I understand that the principal may have been trying to simulate dementia, but for this to be effective, a consistent flow of time needs to be established. As it is, it just seems to be an amateur. <br /> <br /> - The twists of the plot were numerous but consistently predictable. I had no doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that in the end some kind of evil ill-fated development would arise. <br /> <br /> - This may seem grumbling, but the characters in this movie do not employ any kind of common sense. First, the regulatory commissions would be in a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths induced by cardiac arrest. Why would the main psychiatrist also be able to perform autopsies? Why was not a plot made of these impressive qualifications, or of their introduction to their strange choice of religion? What is the background? What is supposed to make us care about someone in this? And most importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so terribly wrong with that and then conclude that it was still a good place to look for a residence? This movie did not even respect his characters enough to give his intelligence the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: See The Wicker Man instead.
