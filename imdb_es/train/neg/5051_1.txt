I am entertained and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and NEVER HAD. This movie is as true about the entire Vietnam War as is Rodney King's beating over ALL police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and they happened), but in general people are like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all use drugs. The atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened much less often than the "hype" would lead him to believe. Oliver Stone has a special ability to make films that show the Vietnam War as this brutal bloodbath, but they are based as much on reality as on Star Wars. If you honestly believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and the NVA did much worse things for the Vietnamese of the south than ANY soldier of the US Armed Forces. UU Fact: Soldiers in World War II treated the enemy much worse in general than soldiers in Vietnam, and were ACCEPTED when they returned home. The good Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was badly fought from a political point of view, no one could have asked our soldiers anymore, and it is a great injury to say that this kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things were really there.
