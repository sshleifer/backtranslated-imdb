Well, what can I say? There are B-grade movies and there are B-grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter. However, since it is obvious that even the creators of the film know that it is not a credible movie (take a look at the final credits) you can forgive. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer who is murdered. He has accidentally mixed his genetic material with an experimental acid that is combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the shape of a snowman, if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is behind the rural town Sherif, who put him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This movie lacks real fear and only the effects remind me of the Grade B movies of the 50s. It just makes it worthwhile to look to laugh. A movie to spend time away.
