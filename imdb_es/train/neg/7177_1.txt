Being that I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its faults, I have to say that this remake of the trailer was terrible. <br /> <br /> Listen to Jovovich say with that lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick The whole does not look Roman at all ... it looks like the backyard of an actor's Hollywood mansion rich, and the Roman costumes look like the cheap junk you buy in a costume store in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> That "charm" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman totally terrified, as if she did not know it's a trailer for a movie. <br /> <br /> The acting should be one of the worst I've seen, with most of the lines I hear are random actors shouting "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" as loud and unpleasantly annoying as they can. <br /> <br /> The random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes with notable actors / actresses like Gerard Butler (who adorns the screen in shadows for three and a half seconds) they do not do anything, they look uncomfortable or they go crazy with their minimal lines, they just drag it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's The other part is that she looks like her usual crack whore leaning against a door mumbling over the moon or something. You can not say it because she's drunk or drugged or she's just mumbling idiotically. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... she laughs randomly and screams in such a way that it irritates you. <br /> <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Particularly "I love" (and for love, I mean, I hate) the line of Ennia, "Caligola ... j00 no maki me * something incoherent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo *" It is also incredibly arrogant to say that the four of Caligula The reign of the year was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this has to be the worst, most exploitative and self-indulgently arrogant piece of junk labeled "art" I've seen in my life. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not have appeared or given his name for this garbage, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a trillion trillion yen). The worst trailer of all.
