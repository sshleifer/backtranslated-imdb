Without a doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and also a talented singer. After all, very few actors today can have a scene in one shot, and that was Sinatra's modus operandi on the set. <br /> <br /> I feel that as the 1960s went on, the quality of man The movies really started going to the tank. The series of detectives of Tony Rome was nothing less than trying to compete with the series Matt Helm by Dean Martin that came out at the same time. Maybe even a James Bond competition, but nothing really worked for Frank during these years. His personal life in chaos, his music fades ... Sinatra looked more like a throwback to the 1950s. The last great Sinatra movie of this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
