Since I loved the cartoons of Inspector Gadget in the 80s, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Inspector Gadget, look at the cartoon. It was much better than the movie.
