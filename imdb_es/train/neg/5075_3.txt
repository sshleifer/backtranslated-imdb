The animation was good, the image was good, although it was not totally original, however, the story was too long, too confusing and too dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to finish it all at once. With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that come from nowhere or go nowhere, this movie really was not a movie at all and would have been better as a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this kind of typical story, you may like it, but, frankly, I have spoiled many more creative stories that actually have some kind of message to tell. Go rent a Miyazaki movie and look at it twice, you'll get a lot more from it.
