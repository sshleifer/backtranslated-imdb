Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what the typical racial characters would do in their role. The untrustworthy Asian girl who has to face another person to get ahead, the white man in love with Asian culture and chooses to leave behind his white world for the land of yellow and the black taxi driver "keeping it real". In addition, the entire product placement of coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts was too obvious. The plot of the story itself was fun, but more or less as I thought the story would unravel. On the other hand, when you see romantic comedies, you can not wait long, but, again, they would have wanted to surprise me at least once. Parents are the best part of the movie.
