I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts in one. Many of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner strictly inserted to fit the genre of romantic comedy. In general, this is fine because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge usually lies in making it original, new and inventive. This movie does not do it. <br /> <br /> It does not make sense who the characters really are, apart from Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional cliche and are nothing more than simple puppets that fulfill the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie can become annoying, the rhythm is missing and the editing is full With unnecessary close-ups. I must also mention the too stylized decorations that make some scenes have nothing natural, or rather, that the attempt to look natural is too obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the sappy music at the right time, which unfortunately often sounds mismatched. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a movie that makes obvious the allusions of Woody Allen ends up being so deceptive. . If you expect a good gay romantic comedy, this is not it. Or rather, this is a poor attempt to do so. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has received so much praise when the cinema is already over 100 years old and there are very superior directors of Quebecois who are making better films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it is a bad idea if you consider cinema as an art and directors as an author.
