Director Kevin Connor and aspiring action hero / romantic Doug McClure, re-team up in this ghost story set in Japan. They had had moderate success in the 1970s, with the style of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Core's Earth' (1976), etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative, however, the results are in poor condition. and derived in the most corny way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue established in the 19th century, where a samurai husband kills his wife and lover before committing suicide. An advance towards the present presents the married couple Ted and Laura, who visit Japan and move to the house where the tragedy occurred. <br /> <br /> There are no surprises as to what happens next, with the spirit of the dead beginning. to take charge of the new inhabitants with the friend of the family Alex (McClure) who assumes the role of mistress of the wife. <br /> <br /> Everything resonates clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charged elephant, an inevitable (but surprisingly negative). ) conclusion. The main points of interest are two weak decapitations ('The Omen' has a lot to answer in promoting this as a standard horror piece), and the love scenes in which the twisted but extremely perverted Susan George finds herself. The first is a long piece inspired by 'Do not Look Now' with her husband, complete with piano music; the second is a much shorter entanglement (probably because of his insistence) with McClure, both of them look quite uncomfortable. Anyway, each cloud has a positive side and both scenes show their fantastic knockers, so not all is lost. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not decide if 'The House where Evil Dwells' is garbage, observable garbage, or entertain masochistically. If you're not into the genre, there's nothing here, but for horror fans it's probably enough to provoke a strange rye-like smile and a gesture of thanks for respect for the effort. <br /> <br /> BEST SCENE: in any In another movie, big mechanical crabs, blacks, tree climbers and Japanese murmurs would have stolen the show. However, they are overshadowed by the legendary family food scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters' soup. Upon seeing this appearance, he asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told meat and vegetables, before pronouncing the immortal line "Ugh - there is a horrible face in my soup". If this was not enough, the answer is: "Come on, eat your soup for dad". Laurel and Hardy rest in pieces.
