I read the comments before watching this movie and I did not believe them. I love fucking movies and I expected this to be average. It was not This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look great. The film contains bad acting, bad sound, bad history confused, bad makeup, and it bored me so much that I turned it off. Even nudity was garbage! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did. You can know if you are going to like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. If you want a good bloody corny movie go to a toxic avenger 4 or even to camp blood. Avoid this garbage: I saw it on TV and I felt cheated, so I did not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
