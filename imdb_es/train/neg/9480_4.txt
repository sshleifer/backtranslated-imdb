I just watched this movie. In a word: sucky! The story is bad, the acting is, if possible, even worse. The movie has one or two nice moments, but that's it and having those two good little moments, does not make up for anything in between, before or after those moments. A monstrosity of a movie, it's not even worth watching on television ...
