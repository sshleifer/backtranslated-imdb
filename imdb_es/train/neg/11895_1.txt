Oh my God, what the hell happened here? I'm not going to say this again, but what kind of backward film is this? The dubbing in this is much worse than the dubbing in "King Kong vs. Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress and the costumes are really cheesy. This is a villain named Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a gorilla robot that has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down, builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (when Linda Miller gets upset) he makes Kong his slave, but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes. Then, Dr. Who sent him the robot. <br /> <br /> Later, when I was watching the movie, I felt a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns began to moan. When I sat in the misery of watching the DVD while I played, I expected the madness in the movie to end until the fight. The end must be really bad because they could have shown Kong again on his island fighting the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Do not look at the movie under any circumstances or if you do ... be careful with the disappointment you will receive.
