An idiot dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. Therefore, there are no new story lines here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid and disgusting movie. If you like to watch children vomit, or see a dentist imagining that you are pulling out all of your wife's teeth in a bloody kind of horror, go see (or rent) the movie. If not, move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, someone?)
