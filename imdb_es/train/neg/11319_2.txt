The vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however, there will be a change of power thanks to a renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) when they face Lance Henriksen and Gary. Daniels (who plays the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions that remain unanswered by this terrible film, the most moving thing is Who's idea was to choose country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior that is capable of giving the best you can . No, do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something, but not as a cyborg. Interestingly, one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, however, Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do so. However, despite the disastrous cast, Kristofferson is easily the most fun of the movie. It gives a much more human performance than the expressionless Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson is playing a robot) Despite the mistakes, Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is crawling and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights is a disconcerting failure. You stay in horror wondering who the hell thought this was a good idea on paper. (This is a movie in which a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) The worst of all ends in a sequel that yes, fortunately this has not yet materialized, although I still have nightmares about the proposition of the probability of such event. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (Bad)
