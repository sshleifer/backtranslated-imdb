Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy working for it ... but obviously someone had some common sense when the powers do not recognize this waste of celluloid ... the edition is the crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason he gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of his clothes and we get a good injection in the chest ... I never thought I would regret that Ralph Macchio made the decision to be. in this, but I do ... and I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, talented actors who should never have appeared in this film ... at least Mr. Leibman had the drawers for refusing to put his name anywhere in the movie ... and it goes ahead ... there are actually copies of this thing with the initial sequence of Mad still in it ... if you can place one, take it because it's probably worth something ... is the only thing in this movie that is worth something ... and a note for people on IMDb.com ... there is no way to spoil this movie by Anyone ... the manufacturers spoiled it by themselves ...
