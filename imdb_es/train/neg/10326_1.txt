Once again, Canadian television surpasses itself and creates another program that will not be seen after its first episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember that comedies were supposed to provoke a reaction that we in the business call laughter. How fun is it to overcome the stereotype of all white people who think that all Muslims are terrorists? Okay, maybe a joke to hit the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's called hitting a dead horse. Even SNL would be able to resign after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Also, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. Can or can not serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast in Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh this is what Emmy wins here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! Which characters? All are cardboard cutouts without anything interesting that makes us want to follow them from one situation to another. That is the point of the sitcom. We need to have strong, interesting and dynamic characters so that we are constantly attracted to the television every week. We have to worry about these characters to worry about the problems they are going to have next week. If I never see these characters it will be too soon. Fortunately, I can not remember any of their names (note for CBC, that's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so insipid. It is more a problem in the casting than in the actors. None of these people actually embodies the characters they play. They seem to act as if they were working on a movie of the week. The sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character, make us fall in love with them, where they become inseparable from the character he portrays. Watch any American comedy and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things, instead of being their only lifelong character for those who will spend the next 8 years portraying. That level of disinterest in the characters and the project proves it. But to be honest, considering the boring concept and the horrible writing, there is not much to do for the actors, but to say their words and try not to hit any furniture. As another commentator mentions, this looks like a television movie and not a situation comedy. <br /> <br /> And the address or lack thereof! What can I say, Canada is so talented, look what Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Look at the Trailers Park Boys (not the movie because it bit the big helium dog). Look at any American program to see the potential of our talent, as that is where many of our stars will find a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give credit to the CBC, they really know how to create publicity for an event that is not an event. . Do you remember "The One"? No, well, do not even try to learn the names of the characters in this show, since it will surely follow the path of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's hope there is a complete ACTRA attack so that nothing like this arises from the Ceeb for a long time.
