First of all, there is no flirting in this movie, with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt, they just do it. Your first test of resistance is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. This would not be so bad. Demons, I like violence and perversion as much as the next critic, but without a context to put it, it is repellent. So you do it through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film becomes something completely different, not better, just different: a road image without a heart. There are failed attempts of comedy thanks to the cameos, widely written and widely performed by bands like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and also some prostitutes and drag queens). Everyone deserves something better. Photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you have motion sickness (or really ANY kind of illness), this movie is not for you. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure who this movie is for - except maybe gay and bisexual S & M fans who like poorly recorded, badly filmed indy movies.
