There are not enough gay-themed films and there are not enough "outgoing" movies. Each one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks really good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad idea. It is a piece of the era: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems 40 years ago from the west. In a way we are seeing our own history; How could it have been for homosexuals in the 40s and 50s here (I was often reminded of 'The last outing to Brooklyn: the book is not the movie). But it is tirelessly depressing and SLOW in an artificial way that evokes an old SCTV dispatch by Ingmar Bergman. It is edited so carelessly that I wonder if the director just does not hack randomly. Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall fell and yes, the life behind the "Curtain" was difficult for gays. A good director could have shown all that without surprising the audience. A good director would have made me mark this as one of the great premiere films and not as one of the strange ones.
