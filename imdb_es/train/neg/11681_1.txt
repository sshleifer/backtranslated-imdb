The trailers of this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I would have expected this movie to come out on DVD because at least it would not cost $ 9. The film totally loses its mark. What could have been a BIG movie for all the actors, turned out to be a B movie at best. The movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought I was going somewhere, it almost did, but then it did not. At this time, we need unpredictable twists and turns of the plot in the film, and this film does not offer either. Everything related to the way we are all suspicious is good, however, I'm not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery of lines, writing or what, but nothing came of it. Lots of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this movie and I tell everyone not to see it. The corny saxophone music also made the movie worse. And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
