I guess "Gunslinger" was not as scary as most of the movies that show "Mystery Science Theater 3000", but the westerns are not the strong Roger Corman. Portraying Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becoming a sheriff in an Old West town after her husband Sheriff is killed and having to fight the bad guys, the movie is pretty predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, who works secretly for the unctuous Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). He also appears briefly the frequent co-star of Corman, Dick Miller, as a postman (Miller now stars in the films of Joe Dante). <br /> <br /> I want to say that you probably want to see the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with that.
