You could say that this is the worst movie I've seen, and I have a lot of appetite for horrible (and good) movies. I could (only) have achieved a kind of adolescent humor if I had been consistently ironic - the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really fun. Other films, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, manage to be fun while (apparently) trying to be serious. As for the performance, it seems that they gathered adolescents with brain death and asked them to improvise all the production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation: that of the motorcycle, which is the largest and largest that bursts the ghoul.
