The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just difficult to keep track of "The man who died," "The whole house" and "Dig that cat, it's really gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who have just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you discover that Charles only married Peggy for his money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down into a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandoned mansion. Charles soon discovers a secret of Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same sensation as the rest of the episodes of the first season.
