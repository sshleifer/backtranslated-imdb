Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. It usually offers solid performances, such as The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. He's doing pretty well here, too, but the rest of the movie suffers from low budget, bad writing and regular photography. The Miller-Movie formula gives you a 4. Richard gets a 5.
