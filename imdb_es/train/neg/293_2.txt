This film is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who end up having problems because they put red dye in one of the shampoos of one of their classmates and after being reprimanded by this act, they decide to go to Florida to go vacation. On their way there, they meet with some guys at a local restaurant and decide that they will meet somewhere else later. The girls end up on a road near the forest and stop for a while and while one of the girls decides to walk a little, she sees that a murder occurs in which the local sheriff is involved. She gets scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go have a look with her and two of them are murdered by the murderer. Then, the two remaining girls are trapped by the killer and placed in the local jail cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff is watching the girls and, despite his insistence that the sheriff is the killer, ignores them both and acts ignorant and everyone else in this movie who simply can not put two and two together, let alone malicious detective work. to that. The best part was the rape scene between the murderer and one of the girls in which he decides to rape her in his cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the nude breast scene, I admit it was good, but before his lips meet, he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon watching him, the same reason is another part of the character. It's not a movie worth renting, not even for a low budget movie of the 80s and the end was the worst ending I've seen in a movie and left me wanting to get my money back!
