I saw and I really liked the first two, really. Especially because the second is not just an attempt to make another as good as the first. And it's a story alone. You do not have to know the first movie. I also liked that in the "Free Willy" films. <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is fine, there are fun parts in it, it's fine. But for what? Timon and Pumba were fun creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a great effort to have even more fun with the first film I already had, as well as telling the story from their point of view. But for what? I'd really like to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two of you sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes next is almost unnecessary. I guess a lot of people liked Timon and Pumbaa, and me too. However, for me, many parts were built with an attempt to be funny. There is no possibility, most of it was not funny, at least for me. By the way, what was the movie about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to have more fun with the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I am very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you like to see stories like "the story behind xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. That's really funny and you should not try to get more out of "Hamlet".
