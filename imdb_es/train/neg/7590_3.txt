Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the flowers of the same name that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the similarities of the plot of the novel by Dumas La Dame aux Camelias, the film Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi La Traviata's opera. Beautiful ladies, not too virtuous, marginalized for one reason or another, loved, divided, gathered just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives the banal patterns and stupid unrealistic dialogue in the opera, but Why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful version of Los Angeles in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty in this mediocre turkey where there is not even a beautiful song?
