Tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. Its history is written, it seems, without any knowledge of the culture of Iowa and the problem of methamphetamine. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film even more disconcerting to me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It does not make any sense. The performance was mediocre at best and, at times, difficult to watch. Free violence and sex filled the film. I suppose violence and sex should make the movie nervous, but it turned out to be incredible and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits in disbelief. When I left the theater, everyone who was leaving was laughing with me. The end of the film was meant to evoke tears, but it did the exact opposite. Do not waste your time in this horrible movie, unless you want to see a stupid ignorant, discontented, exaggerated and clich√©.
