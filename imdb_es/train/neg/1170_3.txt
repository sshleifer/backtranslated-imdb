As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies on the contemporary war between the sexes, he was very eager to see "The Lady and the Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" for how he would treat men and women during a real war, the Revolution French <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with each scene designed as a vintage painting, like a nursery of paintings. And I expected to talk a lot, since that is Rohmer's style. But maybe Rohmer restrained himself by basing the script on the writings of a real woman, which is why for the most part he felt like a docudrama version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel". <br /> <br /> As horrible as the excesses of Robespierre and others, how are you? Any recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I continued muttering to myself: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor are still poor"; You can also choose a song from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> He was not as understanding as the central figure has to come and go between his city house and his country house to stay at the forefront of the Revolution. At one point, her maid claims that the pantry is empty, but manages to offer a good meal. I just did not understand it, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and employer while he and the Revolution continue to change the political focus; I think he was supposed to sympathize with his consistency rather than with his political machinations, like a character in "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Hey, the only reason he did not come home was his misfortune after a romance and a son with the Prince of Wales or someone. <br /> <br /> Usually, in a revolutionary period there is a wave of changes in the relations between men and women, but I have not seen any here. Once I went to a Herbert Marcuse conference that concluded with a long question and answer session; The last question, from a member of the audience much larger than the other acolytes, as she had gray hair, was "why are the revolutionaries so dark?" They insulted her and Marcuse did not deign to respond seriously, but it is the only substance I remember all night. Rohmer shows that the counterrevolutionaries are also somber and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 11/8/2002)
