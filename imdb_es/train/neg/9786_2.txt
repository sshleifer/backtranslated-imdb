Okay, I bought this Woolworths movie so that my friend would make a joke gift on his birthday, because the cover had a sexual innuendo. <br /> <br /> But we decided to see it anyway. Only for reasons of hilarity. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but this has to be, one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> It started well, and we thought "Ok, this could be fine". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious painting artist" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Australian Scouser (I say it because he had an accent that could not be identified), who is acting as I just said It was terrible. <br /> <br /> Then came the end, and by then, we had all lost the will to live. The finals of the paintball. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this plot is that they did not really win, but rather annoyingly they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know it. This has nothing to do with that, but the name the team received was just horrible. Critical damage. I mean they could have chosen a more amazing name, like "The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ" or something like that. Or that's how the movie should be called anyway.
