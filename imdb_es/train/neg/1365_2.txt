The legal gray area concept in Love Crimes contributes to approximately 10% of the movie's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to his flagrant evil. To say that Sean Young's performance as the so-called district attorney is infallible is a gross understatement. With his soft suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the audience of his devotion to men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pretend to be a prostitute just to be able to arrest the cops trying to detect them? This hate is also the only reason why he pursues relentlessly a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual emotion and the driving force behind this shitty movie. Seeing Young go from a cold nudity to a full frontal nakedness recently to arouse interest, but the tantrum that throws next to a fire by a lake does. Seeing her rant and rave about her self-deprecation and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rent, but it's all downhill to and from there. Despite his desire to bring the character of Patrick Bergin to justice, his police skills escape him completely in the midst of his own passion and lust. Patrick Bergin does a pretty decent job as a slimy sociopath; If it worked in Sleeping with the enemy, surely it can work in this. But I can not help wondering if Young's remarkable lack of energy brings the film into conflict with his thinness. I suppose so, and the result is a "thriller" with emotions that are completely bad and, nevertheless, funny.
