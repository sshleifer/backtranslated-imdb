I do not know where to start. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she is put into another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have gotten the motivation of his Val Kilmer character in "Top Gun". Slater walks through this dreck. The direction, the editing, the sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles in them), and hey, there's no discernible plot either. I'm surprised that nobody attached to the project stopped and said: "Hey guys, this just does not make any sense, let's start again." Let's hope that Slater's career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life.
