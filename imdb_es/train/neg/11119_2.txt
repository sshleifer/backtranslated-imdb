Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes join as swindlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds good there. Leave a lot of space for a good comedy and a good story. But such an event did not take place in the many boring minutes of this pathetic attempt at a movie. This movie became redundant, retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my television favorites. Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance", I have come to the conclusion that I should continue playing with fools of the country they sing. His performance was as boring and poor as the movie. Another actress in this unreal movie was Rosie PÃ©rez. I have liked the movies with Perez before, but I have decided that the reason I enjoyed other jobs in her career was that she was not a main character and did not have so many lines of oratory (Do the right thing). But now in White Men Can not Jump he became a central character with many lines, which means that the audience has to endure his incredibly annoying and plaintive voice. So after watching this movie (term used lightly) and listening to Rosie Perez for much more thanking, I can now say that I am a white man and I am preparing to jump. . . of a twenty-story apartment building.
