In fact, I saw China O'Brien II before seeing the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more fun! And more fun = better. If you are a fan of movies like me, this is a great material. However, if you are looking for some kind of meaningful argument, ability to act or ability to make movies, it is better to avoid it. The best part is how they filmed all the fight sequences in the fast-forward stuttering. Hilariously bad See it to laugh, see it as meaningless entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it for free on TV.
