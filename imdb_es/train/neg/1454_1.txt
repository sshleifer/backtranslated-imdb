I've recently seen this movie twice, and it seems I can not understand why the creators made this pile of garbage. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler's surroundings, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, the First World War and the interwar period. What I do not understand is why they imagined Hitler as a monster 100% pure evil, crazy, unreliable and mentally unstable. After all, he was a very considerate, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark side, no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven portray it in this way? All its positive aspects have been eliminated from the stage, leaving nothing but a very propaganda portrait of a man who had the greatest influence in modern civilization. Yes, it drove Germany into the devastating Second World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes, sometimes he was mentally unstable, especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; Why the hell did they lie to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they could come to power in times of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable but so accepted by almost all living Germans (not to mention the Austrians and MANY people) makes it a warning for modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was a "weirdo" " If it had been as the manufacturers have led us to believe, I would have convinced myself that the Germans were retarded. A man like this movie would never have approached the party leader, not to mention the Reichs Kanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
