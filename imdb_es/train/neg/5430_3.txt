Priyadarshan: every time a person heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy". That's why this man is known, or rather, he was known for. After giving great hit comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly derailed with films like Chupke Chupke and some others whose names I can not remember at the moment. Now, with horrible movies like Dhol, the first word that would come to mind after hearing his name would be "torture". <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad jokes, without grace, over the toilet, something dramatic, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes that were fun, though not witty, and second, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the acting was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the performance, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally the Two idiots mentioned previously. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was noisy in his jokes and even in his performance. The grandmother, in the first place looked like a ghost, besides that she was not funny at all but rather silly. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen before one. Four guys behind the girls and in need of money, but with a few turns. There is a 'bad' man who is ridiculously stupid and stupid. And finally, the good overcomes the bad and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a tone full of cash is not ingenious. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its duration. After about an hour, you get tired and want to leave the theater. But being critical, it is my responsibility to tolerate the full two and a half hours of the film. The movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes is repeated over and over again and situations are perennial in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law has arrived at your house and starts making fun of you at everything, then send her this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10
