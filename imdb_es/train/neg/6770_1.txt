I went to see this movie with my 17 years old. daughter. I insisted that we go to the matinee session, not because I am a braggart, but I feel that I did. In the spirit of NASCAR, this is a sponsor's dream. SO advertising so brazen, that almost qualifies as info-mercial, if it were not for the so-called performance. Following the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its corny story lines, the car is just a "vehicle" (no pun) for this ball of corn. Herbie's previous quotas (although with cheese as well) occurred in more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, reigning queen of the Disney drama, has little ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon got involved in such a project. Only the snack bar, it was a bigger scam!
