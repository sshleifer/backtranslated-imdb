I had high hopes for Troy and I am very disappointed. The movie was directed so badly that my stomach hurt. The pace was so slow, the dialogue was laughable and the film, well apart from a good fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana), the rest was superficial. <br /> <br /> And why, oh, why? Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to fit "consumer approval." Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUT of the walls of Troy with an arrow in the ankle! It bothers me that a story as classic as this one becomes a soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even start with the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman for whom the war was fought and it did not even seem that they both cared about each other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the films, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole acted very well with a bad script, but that's not enough to save this horrible movie <br /> <br / > Can anyone tell me where was the budget of Â£ 200 million? Maybe in all the trees they used for funeral pyres, where did they get all those trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed that it hurts.
