I tried to see this abomination of cinema when I was five years old; I have never been the same since then. Filled to the brim with drug-induced images that stink of the common turmoil of its average resident in the asylum, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, ESPECIALLY not for children. <br /> <br /> Start innocent enough with a poor boy who ruins his partner's drum (waiting for him) by sticking it in his head; Yes, putting your HEAD through it. But do not fear, my friends! His flute warms him up quickly, which is quite strange, I grant it, but it's still acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The movie becomes a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where are the wild things. , but loses all the "warm and fuzzy" aspects of either of these two books. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this seven-foot yellow relative of Barney, befriends this poor boy and immerses him even more in despair. <br /> <br /> And, to add the nice variety of horrible themes, you add a carnivorous pot, formerly friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped "dragons", to the mix of chaos. <br /> <br /> The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, nicknamed "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: with an obvious plastic mask that restricts her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest level at the most inopportune times. As a result of this, one of his favorite pastimes was to dive into the body of water that separated the land of Pufnstuf from his degenerate and decomposing dwelling (I do not know where he would have preferred to live). <Br /> <br /> In short, this movie is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie that has similar effects on your audience like The Exorcist, this is for you. Enjoy.
