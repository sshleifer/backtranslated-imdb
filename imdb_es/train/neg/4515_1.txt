"Piece is Cake" is a defeatist, revisionist story of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly wreck the reputation of the (certainly fictitious) pilots it portrays. It left a noticeably bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> In the "Airplane Monthly" of March 1989, Roland Beamont wrote a stabbing condemnation of the way in which the Royal Air Force Combat Command was presented in the television miniseries.

"People had guts or did not have them, but above all they had them, but we knew fear, we recognized it in ourselves and in others , we made our curse to control it and then we continued with the work ... <br /> <br /> "... I could not feel 'glory', but there was a feeling of greatness, and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'Piece of Cake' ". <br /> <br /> Beamont was, in his own words," a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent television series, was there at the time ". <br /> <br /> Beamont served with 87 Squadron in both France and BoB, before becoming one of the leading exponents of Typhoon and The Tempest and a post-war test pilot. <br /> <br / > "Piece of Cake" is an absolute and total misrepresentation of the way the pilots performed in the Combat Command at that time. a total and absolute disgrace ...
