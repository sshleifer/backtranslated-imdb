For Daniel Auteuil, 'Queen Margot' was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ('CrissCross' and 'A World Apart' can not even be compared to this one), and Goran Bregovic for the use of a version of the same musical theme of 'Queen Margot' for this film (Attention to Him movie's ending). If this were an American pop movie, it would not surprise me at all; but for a European film with more actors and independent directors, a similar common approach to child abuse without an original vision is very simple and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell to minors. There are those poor children who hate the people who sell them and expect to be saved by someone. And finally, there is a great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from the bad ones. Each character is shown in simple terms in black and white: good versus evil. Also, from the beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the story of child sexual abuse? I think the difficult issue of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complex than the way it is presented in this not very original film. I think this movie was not annoying, but very disappointing.
