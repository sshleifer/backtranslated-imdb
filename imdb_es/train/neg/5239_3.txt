I saw this movie based on the very favorable reviews I have read about this here by others. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this movie that I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then they start to disconnect and crawl, not to mention that they are completely incredible. <br /> <br /> Finally, you find yourself saying, "What?!? He's going to do that too? How far will he get with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, entering a delicatessen store to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new employee of the store, Auggie Rose, dies during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John enters the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the boy. This seems a bit too much, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful and loving girlfriend, a safe and well-paying job, a nice house, a nice car, costumes Expensive He decides that he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and experience life in a low-paying job, living in a garbage dump with an unpleasant girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why is he weak? The ingenious, half-baked film received favorable reviews that I will never know. Of course Goldblum does a good job of acting, he always does, and his appearance has improved with age, but unless he has a GREAT crush on Jeff Goldblum and has to watch all the movies he's in, I would not recommend this turkey . At about two hours of his life he will not be back, and believe me, he will not have anything to be grateful for when those two hours are over, apart from being grateful that he is not yet sitting there watching this movie. ! <br /> <br />
