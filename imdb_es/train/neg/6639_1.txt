It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making films. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab in the camera. It is unfortunate that of the many films that are made annually in Romania, the worst ones are sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without argument, performance or script is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
