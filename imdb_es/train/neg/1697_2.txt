I'm a huge fan of David Lynch and I have everything he's done on DVD, except the Hotel Room and the 2-hour Twin Peaks movie. Then, when I found out about this, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... What is this? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are noisy and disgusting in their mouths and graceless. Maybe I do not know what is good, but maybe this is just a bunch of garbage that was imposed on the public under the name of David Lynch to also earn a few dollars. Let me clarify that I did not mind the obscene language part, but I had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors could have done it. In general, this is a very disappointing release and may have been left in the luxury box as a curiosity. I recommend that you do not spend your money on this. 2 out of 10
