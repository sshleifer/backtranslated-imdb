The bad news is that it is still really terrible. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of the parodies of this kitchy slap actually look funny. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and progress must be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking a lot when I saw it and I felt generous. Anyway, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's pretty fast. Take elements of most of the key themes and fight scenes from Kill Bill I and II, cut them, pack them, hinder the dialogue and crush the whole mess in an hour of really horrible video for amateurs. <br /> <br /> It is better that you smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this. And return this DVD to the video store on time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
