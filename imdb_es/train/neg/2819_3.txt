The Marquis de Sade, Egypt, the ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and nudes, murder and chaos ... on paper The Terrors of the Night by Tobe Hopper it seems that it should be at least a funny movie and entertaining considering the ingredients. . It is not. It is a less plot, an incoherent chaos that brings little entertainment. Basically, there is no plot beyond some vague things about a cult that follows the work of De Sade, who for some unclear reason feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That's more or less, I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the writers thought. Most of the film is a meandering chaos, since the heroine is exposed to several oddities, sequences of dreams and erotic encounters, interspersed with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the nineteenth century who chewed the landscape. It seems that the manufacturers tried something serious, but whatever their pretensions, they are buried in decapitated heads of poor quality, bad performance and false appearance. <br /> <br /> There are not many positive points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always, and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, although not very talented, is attractive and is in several stages of undressing through the film, but watching Night Terrors is a difficult task. At least I was able to see the movie that came out of the guide titled "When you're as criminal as I am" from the Australian film certification guide that was on the cover of so many VHS tapes of the nineties.
