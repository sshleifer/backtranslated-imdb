Do you like to stop? So, get away from this ... <br /> <br /> During the first rounds, in fact there are good comics, but unless they had some nice qualities, they had a chance of snowballs. Any controversial material and you're out! ... and I think it hurts as much as discarded comedians, when I see who the crooked judges are letting in. <br /> <br /> 1 of my 4 best did it beyond the preliminaries. Half + of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. Several of them have taken their material elsewhere, something that judges do not seem to have problems with. <br /> <br /> It's more entertaining than much of what's on TV, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplation. what could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticisms would lose validity. Maybe an idea?
