Big hair, big breasts, bad music and a giant safety pin ... these are the words to better describe this terrible movie. I love corny horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but this had to be one of the worst ever made. The plot is thin and ridiculous, acting is an abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is the final showdown with the police and how he discovered who the murderer is so badly written), clothing is sick and funny in equal as the hair is big, bounce off many boobs, men wear those cut shirts showing their bellies (¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¿again ... in almost every scene trash, music breasts and paramedics removing bodies ... and the gym is still not close to the duel! jokes aside, this is a really bad movie whose unique charm is to remember the disaster that was in the 80s and laugh how bad everything was back then.
