The perfect murder was thwarted when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who directed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune to receive a visitor when she is about to move. the body outside ... crazy crazy escaped dressed in a suit of Santa Claus (played by a horrible and horrible Larry Drake). She defends herself for her life while trying to find a way to hide her husband's body. She decides to use an ax, once she knocks down Santa's killer who loses several opportunities to cut off the woman's head, to frame the killer for the murder of her husband. Santa's assassin locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter while desperately trying to free herself to save the girl. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT simply recycles tired material that involves the old "Santa kills" theme, at the same time adding the most used routine (add nauseum) woman-murders-her-husband -for-a-man-she-has been-deceived-with. Essentially, Trainor tries to find a way to avoid being trapped with a corpse that she kills while keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new in this plot, which goes through the movements. It is not one of the highlights of the program.
