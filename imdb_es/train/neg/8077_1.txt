I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I have to be one of the twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember a lot, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, the plot did not make sense and, when I left the theater, the only thing I could say was at least now that I know which is the worst movie. I never saw it. It was one thing that bothered me incredibly: if you can make the temperature as you approach the sun be low enough for humans to survive, why can not you lower it to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? ? How stupid do you think we are?
