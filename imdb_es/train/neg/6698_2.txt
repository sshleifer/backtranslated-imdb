Say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good art movie, even in a twisted surrealistic game like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because those movies really have something worth discussing when the credits accumulate. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries in all the avenues to be so deep and intellectual, essentially there is no substance in this movie. This movie is badly made, the images in this movie are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie ... I chuckled at GUITAR BROTHERS, but that was immediately erased by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. I tried to be profound and meaningful, I think, but it's just pretentious, disoriented nonsense. First-year film students without a camera could create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and the stand-up routines between skits get 1 point each, everything else is just a bad step, pseudo-creative, hard-nosed attempts to be as good as other directors' films real as Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people who rave with FFFC are doing it because they have no idea what they saw, because they were just simple statements here and there mixed with stupidity and mixed until you vomit in your own shoes. <br /> <br /> This movie was an extreme disappointment, coming out of the height of Survive Style 5+, a film that really has meaning, combined with an excellent use of landscapes, cinematography, flashy dialogues, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic rhythm and flow. FFFC presents exactly the opposite in every way, boring landscapes (20 minutes looking at a tasteless beach at night, a completely white stage? Balls of aliens floating in the blank space? A small hallway of the school and then a ... school hallway?), Terrible cinematography, forgettable dialogues, nothing funny or humorous, except the fact that you just wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack, amateur performances, uneven, disconnected and, often, the pace of the drag, zero flow at all. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that this is what makes FFFC a great movie, which is as unconventional at all times as its pure genius. This is simply a way of caressing your own ego, because it seems that "unpredictable" could be a good quality for a movie if it were not along with "boring", "innate" and "terrible". Personally, I talked to two people who confessed that the FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but an overwhelming rave on the part of the artistic elitist made them see the film again and then they came back to me with a ... "Hey, it was Pretty good, I liked it. " <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is bad, I do not care if Roger Ebert says that this movie is the best he's seen since he lost his own virginity. "The new layer of the Emperor", I say ... this movie is not in any way indicative of the other psychedelic / trippy movies that come from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even on a low budget), and none can honestly be compared to Survive Style 5+. Look at FFFC only if you are interested in doing a pretentious heap of nothing on a tight budget.
