I do not know much about making movies, but good movies have to tell some kind of story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they can do it, but it is not satisfactory, and I do not want to say a happy ending, just ANY end. <br /> <br /> Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 in Brooklyn during a brutal labor strike, launches a series of threads of history. Most involve some of the most unpleasant characters that have ever walked on a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn can not bring these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them hanging without an ending, or explodes in a strange stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. <br /> <br /> Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie), is hit by a car and killed. And that's all for him in the movie ... it's gone forever, erased from the memory of everyone ... without reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, the leader of the stupid, clueless and secretly gay strike, after being rejected by work, his gay lover, and discovered by the neighborhood thugs, is trampled by the bullies The final scene of the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very similar to those of the Nazi extermination camps ... and the scene goes on and on ... and the camera moves towards the body of the worker leader, and has been crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And, of course, that's it for him too ... erased from the brain ... gone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell ... no matter what critics originally said in 1989 about this movie ... This movie is a depressing piece of mud. Avoid It And if you do not warn it, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... do not even allow teens to see.
