Of the ten actors who played Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most agreeable, but in this script the audience is far ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the rider, Douglas Walton, stares into space, obviously hypnotized, and says something like "I must ride and die," I felt it was foolish for anyone to detect it after they killed him. The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After the hated owner of a horse, Gene Lockhart, is shot dead, Frieda Inescort does the same, saying that she is going to be killed, and then fatally leaps from a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouted "I got it", as if it were a revelation. However, the guilty party was cleverly concealed and considerable suspense was generated when that part begins to hypnotize Lowe to jump off a roof.
