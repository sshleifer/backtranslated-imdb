Slashers ... well, if you like horrors, it's definitely one to see, otherwise, do not bother. It is completely obvious that this movie has an extremely low budget. For example, it seems that the whole movie has been filmed. a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the shadow of the microphone and the camera of the camera, trust me, you will not have to look for them. Also try to ignore the corny actors, if that's how you call them. The basic scheme Some people decide to go to a games program in which they have to survive one night in a big maze because they are 3 loose assassins and who lives in the end becomes rich. Now there is something in this movie that keeps you watching and you rarely find that with an economic horror these days. For example, when I saw it, I thought I would not mind trying this game. Especially for $ 12,000,000. So anyway I recommend you look at it and decide.
