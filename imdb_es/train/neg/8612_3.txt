This was a movie that could be seen, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's previous films. That said, it was worth the time to see. I gave this one 5 out of 10. So, basically, it's one of those movies that you do not do to watch, but if you find it in the subway, you risk it.
