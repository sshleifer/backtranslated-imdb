This is a sad movie about this woman who thought that her ex, whom she loved, was probably dead, but in fact her scientific father had just cast a spell to turn him into this really cute shark. Something like in the beauty and the beast. You could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing chandeliers, but there are some pretty rude plants in place. They make this girl bite a lot, so she lets herself be eaten by the shark instead of scratching the whole movie. The scientist is a good father who tries to reunite his son shark shark with the woman with whom he was engaged, he even arranges for them to have private time for sex, but the woman in this is a really superficial snob and thinks that the shark ... The guy is an ugly and disgusting monster and does not want to have anything to do with him. She gave up on love! Only because it was a shark! I thought it was very sad that all I had to do was kiss him and that he would return to normal and that they would live happily ever after, but it is not that kind of movie.
