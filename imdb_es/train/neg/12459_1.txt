Considering how much money was budgeted for this movie, we would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be the most useless movie I've seen. There was no real advance of anything. Development of the character, minimum. Advancement of the plot, maybe. Pleasure, none. I'm not sure what points they were trying to make. If you want to see a movie in which the terrorists are a little bit good, the US CIA bombs everything that does not agree with our opinions, all the capitalists are corrupt and would like to see something similar to a script advance accompanied by a death. For those of us who realize that it is not necessary to kill a good guy to make a point, we will stay with other movies. In short, this was a horrible attempt at an 'Ocean 11' style movie hide-the-plot-so-what-has-to-think because not only do you not know what's going on, no one who made the movie did either . Alone at home 3 was a better cinematographic piece.
