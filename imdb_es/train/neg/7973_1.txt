I go to many movies, I often bring my 5-year-old son, I am very happy that I did not bring him to this one. There are many references to sex and a thin immersion scene, however, that is not the main reason why it would not lead to that. The trailers lead you to believe that it is a happy comedy; However, virtually all the fun moments are in the previews. I kept waiting for him to get interesting, funny or anything less serious; however, I almost fell asleep when the plotless story went on. I understand that dogs can be a great company, having said that, the whole story focused on a dog of bad behavior that the owners were not smart enough to train. If a human caused so much damage and chaos, that person would be forbidden. The worst movie I've seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of his talent. The best way to summarize this film is, the couple becomes undisciplined, the couple falls in love with the dog, the dog dies, the couple becomes sad. The end.
