The show is average. It does not make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really knocks him down. She does not look natural. She has these three ways of speaking, all robotic. He speaks in a low voice (without intonation), he speaks normally (without intonation), or he does that where he begins to speak normally and starts to scream gradually. However, his screams are like "let's simulate that I'm screaming because I should not be too high on the set". <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware that this cute actress is doing this funny thing. It is annoying. You really can not capture her personality, because she really does not produce emotion and does not get angry. She has this husband, who is doing all these stupidities, and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and simple performance.
