After getting up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I could also entertain myself while suffering from lack of sleep. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. That mistake! <br /> <br /> Here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you care): a neurotic man with an addiction to sweets (Josh Kornbluth) works like a temperature for a ridiculous company. Suddenly, he is offered the opportunity to "leave", which seems to be the favorite slogan of this movie. But with a safe job and secure income at his fingertips, Josh decides for some stupid reason why he does not want to do it. He inevitably binds several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. Your inability to send several "very important" letters within a given period of time is supposed to be hilarious, but it's just stupid. Josh knows and cheats a lawyer and ends up together in bed (obviously, it's a real life fantasy of Josh, since such a thing would never happen). A lot of other things happen, but it's too trite and insane to do it now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie is cataloged as a comedy, I only laughed twice; the first time was the first shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was fear) and the second was when I was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, on the right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying looking person I have ever seen in my life. He is a bald, unattractive and overweight Jewish man who is supposed to have sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with the character of Josh at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip, even if your life depends on it.
