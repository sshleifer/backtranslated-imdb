A noble effort, I suppose, but ultimately poor. Before watching this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was impossible to filter. After seeing it, I still do it. Unfortunately, I think that only those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and will be upset by the unnecessary revisions of the film (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even Paul Scofield's superb talents can not save what seems to me a well-intentioned but misguided effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic.
