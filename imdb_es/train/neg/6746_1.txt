* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know that creative juices were not running high when this puppy was conceived. The movie is your basic low budget movie. Oh, sure, try to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that it was just a joke anyway. Well, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that a new girl in the city starts dating her co-worker. He invites her to his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell him how they have a "club of murders" and they kill people, blah, blah, blah. Well, we found out that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine killed a woman in a parking lot. Now, the "members" of the Murder Club are being killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends in a disappointment. By then, you will not really care. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes of this movie does not make sense. The motivation for the murders at the beginning of the movie is never explained. I would say it was a way for the director to pass the movie, but on the DVD there are scenes deleted! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the "Bleed" version, but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers would claim more. In the box, it says that there are Easter eggs, but why the hell would I like to waste my time looking for extras in this movie? <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and "Bleed" showed up on that front. Although it was not a bad and funny movie. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there's a lot of nudity, but the acting is just horrible. My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think it's supposed to be fun and funny, but it ends up being a tool. I think the funniest moment in the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking lot, in a hilariously convincing death. The heroine pushes the women towards the concrete post of the parking garage, and the woman seems to hardly hit him, spits out a mouthful of blood and "dies". <br /> <br /> For those who think that the creation of films is a complex and creative process carried out by professionals, see "Bleeding". He will change his mind and realize that any pirate can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time or money on this.
