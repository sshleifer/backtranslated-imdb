Just a regular Jason Lee movie. There were some parts of the movie that were fun. The background of the movement is to live life to the limit, I suppose. These are the types of movies that I think 14-year-old girls watch at their pajama parties. It was a good movie. It is one of those movies that you have in the background and look from time to time when something catches your attention. I think Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and I would like to see them in a movie with a good story and a plot. It's just a kind of guy meets a girl. This is the perfect movie they would show in the Central comedy. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, it would have made me angry. But I guess that's why I did not see him in the theater.
