... but it will make you wonder if we had one in the first place! This movie is as bad as any of today's horrible horror. A man walks around looking at the semi-dressed ladies, trying to decide which one to kill in order to give a new body to his girlfriend. One scene involves a man who staggers around and spits throughout the set for three full minutes, covering everything that must be more than ten gallons of "blood." The film also tries to create a feeling that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so badly made that it is impossible for the audience to unearth any sense of shock or outrage. Despite being dark and sinisterly sinister, this film can not even have its own title: the initial credits say "The brain that would not die", but the final credits list it as "The head that would not die".
