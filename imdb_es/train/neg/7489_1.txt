American films about war and the Nazis simply can not be good. They can not refrain from becoming idiots and follow an agenda. All Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest but so capable, sensible and human. Come on, for this nonsense. The main character says something like "in this trial, we have to turn the aggressive war into a crime". Is America a peaceful nation with its "defense" world budget of $ 420 billion (the # 2 of China with only $ 51b)? Is it simply spent on this without any ... ROI? Why portray the United States as a peaceful nation when it is not? I deeply dislike movies with an agenda: they throw art into hell and try to persuade us to believe in something. Hollywood should put a label on movies, just like record companies have that label of "parental advice." We should have a "shit warning", a "propaganda ad" or a "politically correct counseling" label in some movies. This is one of them.
