I just watched this movie and I have not read the book. The good thing about the film is that in some places it makes you think a little about the spiritual theme, evolution, synchronicity and your part in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film breaks easily and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book is lost a lot in this version of the movie. The events that were supposed to show the synchronicity that take place are almost unrecognizable. Much reasoning must be done so that the viewer sees that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more so to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /> <br /> The lighting scenes are visually deficient and do not create the best feeling of what was supposed. Do you remember the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, this is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes are badly executed. There are many scenes that do not really develop the story and neither help create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow can not save it The first 2 seem to have obtained more scenes than their characters should have tried to save the film, and because they paid more, but this does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help at all. The scene in which he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is simply a bad script. The execution of the scene when it dies in an explosion is absurdly poorly executed. The flashbacks throughout the movie can not even be commented on. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a big part of the time, read the book! I have not read it, but it's probably a billion times better than this, it has to be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment on IMDb.
