I'm a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe I made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are hardly scenes with more than two people in the picture together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal facing is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen were doing everything possible but they did not work. Voice modulation of Rajpal Yadav: inefficient and quite useless. Mohanlal did full justice and again showed that the performance has to do with facial expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. The situation of the comedy that was adapted from the original sholay faded in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but due to the controversies that surrounded the film, he ruined it and only for the good. of doing he did this Aag. But there is no fire.
