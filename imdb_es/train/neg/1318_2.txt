A sentimental school drama set in Denmark, 1969, "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish view of American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a naive obsessed with flowers, naive 13, leaves with half his ear hanging from the office of the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen's (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a school principal, represented as a fascist tyrant, has the local community in control. Lindum-Svendsen went too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental crisis (of course, there was not enough drama anymore ...), and the hippie music teacher, Mr. Svale ("Hi, call me Freddie") , Frits defends justice. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what. It is so unconvincing, more than (method) acted, and so full of misery, that as a "family" image this grotesque excuse full of clich√© for a film fails to convince the non-Scandinavian audience. Excuse me, kind Danish readers, to hang on like this in your sentimental trips ... But it's definitely NOT a story about how a child becomes a man fighting against the system. The child never becomes a man, but remains a naive and wide-eyed crying. If you call a small-minded church of small people, led by a dictator like a cartoon character "the system", I'm sorry if I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> If you like family photos, go see Happy Feet instead.
