I'm a big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a little less fond of Stephen King, but I like part of his work. <br /> <br /> That said, I should have ENCHANTED 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I went in anxiously. I left disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the actors' fault. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles because the premise of the film puts Cusack on the "boy in a closed room" stage. <br /> <br /> This was not a BAD movie, but I can not call it a good one either. It was a confusing mess that had moments of "ouch, that's just INCORRECT," combined with moments of "ouch, that's just painful," and moments of "oh, now THAT's just unfortunate" with very little continuity-connectivity between them . Eislin's father appears once, and there is no apparent connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see when he tries to survive the room. <br /> <br /> A previous commentator described the Olin / Enslin argument as worthy to see, and I very much agree. But aside from that, apart from some clever musical tracks (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a bit, and gives him the chance to get out before raising the bet ... at that moment he gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the carpenters' line "We just started" is mainly "things jump when you least expect it!" The kind of horror was funny when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my age, cuddling in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was "let us relive some of your most painful experiences" mind game, with "we animate the paintings in a creepy way" clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected something better from this movie with the name of Stephen King, as well as the actors I mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> We never discover the origin of evil. We never got to see the evil defeated, although we can suppose that maybe he was defeated. <br /> <br /> And the ending was just a "What?" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to come in the cable. I would not have minded paying for it like a matinee, but I feel a little undermined by having paid the opening prices of the night for it.
