A suggestion that I think can be picked up by the various comments in this thread. <br /> <br /> I was quite surprised by the number of people who liked this movie who want to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory". br /> <br /> I think this gives us a small idea of ​​the reason why this film and the underlying theme are so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The Global Warming problem attracts a lot of people who want to force others to "do the right thing". It is especially attractive to the more "liberal" people who are inclined because it has nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, which is what usually makes conservatives who want to force him to "be good" by going. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful in that. He simply can not avoid appealing to those people who want to force others to do what they should. The political appeal is too big. <br /> <br /> And there we have a scientific problem that can be of great importance, reduced to a political problem that attracts those in the body politic with a predilection for forcing others. to "do the right thing". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the environmental movement was hijacked by those people.
