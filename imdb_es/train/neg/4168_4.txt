Well, this movie started funny but it deteriorated quickly. I thought it would be a more "adult-oriented" mood based on the first few moments, but then the movie changed to a badly done kind of mode for the Disney Channel, especially a kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is beautiful but has a really false Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was a very nice moment that I will call the scene of the serenade, but in general this was a yawn. The laughter is very few and distant. The final surprise for "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that it left me more angry than anything else. It might be worth checking out if you can watch it for free or on TV, but do not waste your money buying or renting this movie.
