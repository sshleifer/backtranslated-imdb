Do you ever want to just kill an hour or two doing homework and watching a movie so badly that it defies reason? Well, by renting movies over the weekend I see the art picture of this and I see the T-Rex. Knowing very well that the dinosaur in the package was the T-Rex of Jurassic Park, I knew that I had to rent this just because I wanted a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. least. <br /> <br /> Angry scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about their fortune and shareholders than for their lives, and of course, a great T-Rex, puppet and ill-bred. Am I my through the movie were there scenes clearly spliced ​​from other movies? Not to mention that Rex's hunger is never satisfied ... never. The way he is hungry gets over me because he does not really have a throat (really, if you look through his mouth when he roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, from time to time I like to watch B movies incredibly bad because it reminds me how much better is a very successful movie. This was hilarious. I'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes in which, make no mistake, they'll laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the film's budget ... yes, but did not the acting help? Okay, Tony Todd was pretty good, in terms of some of the female roles ... when you cry, should not "tears" come out? Meh, I'm not going to get mad at this movie, I knew what I was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, this is what I recommend: watch this movie, go immediately to Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back. He will write thank you letters to Mr. Spielberg the next day.
