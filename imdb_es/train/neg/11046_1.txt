This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, all bad. In the last 15 minutes an appropriate cat was introduced: the cyborg, which confuses everything. Malcom MacDowell should have needed to make a payment for the house because, otherwise, he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can move from Clockwork Orange to this shit and be able to look in the mirror every morning. I could have had better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity. The editor must have been asleep or not. As for drugs, it's so bad. Act. Do they have to smoke to be bad? The gun fires blue flames or bullets, it is decided. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so similar that it's confusing. Whay is called Seadly Wake 2013. It has nothing to do with the movie.
