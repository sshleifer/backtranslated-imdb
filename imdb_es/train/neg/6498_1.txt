I've seen bad movies before, but this one has the prize "The worst movie of my life" by far !! Anthony Hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name associated with it, anywhere! I will never see another movie with him in it, directing it, etc., etc.! I can not believe that the other actors and actresses that I liked (in this photo) have leaned so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs out there! For anyone who is not ashamed to be part of a movie like this, it's beyond me! Save your money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! What a shame, Mr. Hopkins! Also, the shame of Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
