This movie was strange ... I saw her while eating a room of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really strange. I'm pretty sure you're supposed to see it high, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing ... maybe lsd would work. The movie is a lot of things that are transformed into other things, and they dance. It's really cheesy by today's standards, but when it was released, I'm sure it was fine ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think that this movie was good, but I did not find it very interesting, and at that time I was taking mushrooms. If you have a party or something and everyone is very enlightened, put them to laugh.
