The original movie (dated 19?) Did not show any "monster", just SUGGESTED terrifying "things". <br /> <br /> This version, however, shows all aspects of a "sick-minded ghost", even unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery", as presented in the original movie, was the most terrifying part: one simply did not know what was causing the strange things that happened. By showing the face of the "old man", this man has disappeared completely. Worse yet: the special effects (children's wooden cries) are ridiculous. This is a new stupid version, too spectacular to be as close as the original one.
