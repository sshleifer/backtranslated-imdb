I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember that the premise of the film is that a group of hotel occupants are attacked by ants that eat men. What I did not remember was, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡Surely it must have been a mistake because movies like this They generally disappear from existence and never meet again! Suzanne Somers (at the height of her career playing Chrissy in 'Three's Company') plays a tourist at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing a swimming pool outdoors and accidentally disturbing an ant nest. Or should I say, a * MAN OF E-EATING MAN * !! One of the workers is attacked by the ants. One minute he is taking them off one by one, and the next minute he covers them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the earth. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was very unlikely, you should see Myrna Loy playing with a wheelchair resident who flew out of the Mansion by helicopter! I could almost imagine her thinking, relieved, that she was flying out of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final scenes show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> That's basically the movie. There really is no "disaster" or "big star" appeal to the movie. It was intended to be a "large-scale" television event at that time. Now, it is fortunate that it is downloaded at a 4:00 am time at your local television station. <br /> <br /> If you want to capture Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing something to put the bread on the table and pay the bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
