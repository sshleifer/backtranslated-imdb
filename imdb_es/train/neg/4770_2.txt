I wanted to like this movie, yes, it's a SAW, blah blah blah, but I like those movies. If it is done well, this has all the ingredients of being a good movie, not brilliant, but good ... unfortunately those ingredients have shot! The acting was terrible, and this was seen for the first time when the captives showed up with their captor one by one (the hoods were removed), the comments and the liners are just terrible, yes, I know, badly written ... but This is more More than that, it was bad writing, along with a bad performance. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even recognize him until much more in the movie ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I even wonder why I bother checking this out. Movie at all. <br /> <br /> I'll finish with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
