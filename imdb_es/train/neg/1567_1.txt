I had to change my opinion about the worst movie in the world that I just saw. THIS IS! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Desperate story (despite being based on a true story). Terrible performance (what Judge Reinhold thought) Incredibly bad stunts. Children's dialogue Non-existent continuity Lack of environment <br /> <br /> Do you have the image? <br /> <br />
