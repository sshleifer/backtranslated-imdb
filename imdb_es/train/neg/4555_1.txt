This film fails to capture any of the mysteries and intrigues offered by the book. The main point of the book, the ideas, almost do not touch, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is doing so much for them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. No background or personal development means that the audience does not really care about what happens to them, and therefore the action sequences become flat. leaving a feeling of satisfaction with respect to what the complete search was. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I've seen in my life. It is horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the objective of making the film was to discredit the book, so this film is so bad and ridiculous. It's also a shame, because it could have been good if they had taken full advantage of their success and probably would have been able to get a good scriptwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please, don't waste your time, read the book!
