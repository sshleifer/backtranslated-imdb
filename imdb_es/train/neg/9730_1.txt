Now, I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how stupid this movie was, and he did not bother with a good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just break me. And there are some lines that do not make sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper has just launched lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! By the way, the plot is bad! But it is one of those movies that is TAHT BAD that is really VERY PENDING to watch. I recommend this only for BIG fans Brad Dourif, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
