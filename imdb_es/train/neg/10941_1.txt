['WOW, what can I say? I like shity movies and I make an effort to see a cheesy action movie, but Snake Eater would prefer to have a nail stuck in the hole while my grandmother gave me a dance back. This guy has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton has self-control. It has all the assets to make a really bad movie even worse. Crazy Hillbilles YEP! Unnecessary tits (with a really strange scar) YES! shit soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but 1 is as low as possible. Seriously, I think someone was telling me a joke when I saw that it could not be real ... the worst thing is 2 MORE MOVIES IN MOVIES! ...... I guess it&#39;s in demand.']
