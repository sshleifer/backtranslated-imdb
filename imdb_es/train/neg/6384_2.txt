['I was recently online looking for a site that presented movies in the public domain. In his long list of films was this movie and I thought I should be hallucinating with such an offensive title and premise. But, no, that&#39;s really what it was. And since the movie only lasted about 27 minutes, I decided to try it. If it had turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped looking. Instead, it turned out to be the strangest movie I&#39;ve ever seen. The Danish production team tried, with a budget of around $ 49, to make a Star Trek-style movie about a team of very homosexual men traveling through the galaxy eliminating female oppression by killing all women, as they did in the Land! And in all cases, they were received with cheers and thanks from the now homosexual men of the planet. <br /><br /> Subtle, this is not. With some of the most obscene and juvenile character names I&#39;ve heard, I do not even think I can write them in IMDb without my opinion being deleted! However, despite the complete stupidity of all this, it was strangely visible and worth a look. But, as I mentioned, due to the rough names and the strange themes (although they are not naked), it is a film only for adults. <br /><br /> By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions about who would do this, WHY did it and who was the intended audience? It may not be the worst I&#39;ve seen in my life, but it&#39;s probably the strangest and possibly the most offensive.']
