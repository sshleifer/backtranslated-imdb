Screenwriter Lisa Lutz started writing the script at the age of 21 in 1991. <br /> <br /> Is she even in the business? If someone gave him another chance after this piece of shit, she is willing to get the Afortunate Person Of Ever award. This film has no end ... It never ceases to amaze me how the movies are ... and the fact that they made this writer leave him for a moment? Seriously? I can write better shit that is in my dream. <br /> <br /> Well, then, how many lines do I have to write? I do not understand this at all. I guess "I'm a rookie, I guess I do not understand why there should be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a fee? Seriously, I do not care if you have a one-word sentence ... or even a one-word answer, I mean, are we going? <br /> <br /> Thanks ... is this enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is worth nothing.
