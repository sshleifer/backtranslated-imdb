When Marlene Dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938, one of the few actresses named by the trade papers, these were films like The Garden of Allah. How a movie could be so beautifully beautiful to contemplate and be so insipidly boring is beyond me. Also, if Marlene, if she tried to expand her range and not play a sexpot, she was stuck with an old-fashioned story. <br /> <br /> The Garden Of Allah, one of the first films in modern technicolor. was a novel set at the end of the last century by Robert Hitchens, who later collaborated on an adaptation of the play with Mary Anderson, which was presented in 241 performances in 1911-12. Then he got two silent screen adaptations. The story is about a monk who flees from the monastery in French Tunisia to see something of what has been lost in the world. He meets an equally protected woman who was not married and spent her best years taking care of a sick father. She is now traveling in the desert and the two are in a train. <br /> <br /> The woman is, of course, Marlene and the fugitive monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what David O. Selznick thought when he shot this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman could have made it acceptable to the audience. But you can bet that the audience that came out of the 1936 film, when he invested his money in a ticket, expected to see Marlene as a modern Salome instead of a saint with that title. The audience still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was a desert romance and seduction what they expected. <br /> <br /> As for the monks, you must remember that they are self-sufficient in their monasteries and in this particular. A bottle a special wine of which Boyer is the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink its economy if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the leader Charles Waldron onwards they have the right to worry a little about self-interest. <br /> <br /> Anyway, here it says a lot of religious places. for a couple of cables that really are not suitable for the parts. More especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this movie with an eye on the special color film of the desert and forget the plot.
