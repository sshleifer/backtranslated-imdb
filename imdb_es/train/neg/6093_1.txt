This has to be the worst movie I've seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, well, the DVD worked well, it's just that the movie did not, in fact it's so bad that I think none of the actors have worked since (or before judging by the performance). There is no real plot to talk about or a real horror. The production values ​​are garbage, even for a low budget movie, since some external scenes are difficult to hear due to the wind in the microphone. <br /> <br /> In general, it was such a bad movie that the viewer might think it was. It would become a porn movie if they did not know anything better (which has been an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are fun, which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they barely deserve to see the 76 minutes long) <br /> <br /> Regarding DVD marketing, I feel completely cheated. I mean that reading the back expected it to be bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He selected his victims. He picked up his nose. It became a GIRL! <br /> <br /> But I thought it could be fun. In addition, the case claims that it has been digitally mastered, I would love to have seen it in advance, the print is so grainy that it could be used as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolutely disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY ?, disgusting production, acting. <br /> <br /> This movie stays well received in the first five minutes, (if you are considering buying this, you would). For example, buying "bad taste" is a much better movie and it's fun, it also has Peter Jackson, the LOTR director. <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, post here as I would like to know, just to find out if there is a movie worse, or if someone in this movie bothered to learn to act.
