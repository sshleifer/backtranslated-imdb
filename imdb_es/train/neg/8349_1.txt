Walking around without reason ... I will never recover those two hours of my life. The boy continued assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did this gain a price anywhere? I understood that he loved his father, but, apart from that, the film did not make any sense to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason? How did your life enrich this? Why did we have to see the dying old woman in her underwear? Why? ??? <br /> <br /> I thought it would be deep or about something more interesting. I do not recommend the movie even to follow while I sleep ...
