Wow, after destroying the album of Timo Roses "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a simple nonsense curse ... I think some people just do not understand it) I was interested in this movie. I read some positive things and the package and the look of the film seemed to be far from the total garbage I expected after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: the film is not total garbage, but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter cinema, like Olaf Ittenbach and others like it. That means that "Barricade" is in extremely bloody and detailed parts. The Gore FX are not really credible, but it's okay, the acting is fine, but in some cases it's just bullshit. The Hillbilly girl in the start sequence is ridiculous and does not improve until she is shot. <br /> <br /> So, what's the problem ... the film is bloody, it has a typical German underground environment (including the classic Booby shots in blood), OK FX and a modern feel like the packaging already promised? <br /> <br /> 1. The script is total BS. You get a typical story of hillbilly / lost in the forest with some uncles + gal camping and meet a degenerate family of hillbilly. Everything is leading towards the torture / mutilation scenes and it seems incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricada" not enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of the work with the camera (I liked the repetitive cutting of the tweezers in the whirlwind torture scene ... or they did not have material or editor works in a hardware store). Worst yet the edition ... of course, it's modern and much better than many other films in the genre, but it's RANDOM. He got an excessive use of that typical exposure effect everywhere and without any meaning ... it's there ... all the time. Then there is a grainy / noisy film aspect that is also thrown here and there for the sake of it, I do not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Just like the effects mentioned above, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most murders are published with multiple repetitions of stabs and punches. It's fine once, but here it's annoying and false, especially towards the end. Annoying also attributes the "music" that is used permanently without any change in the background. It does not take long until the movie is hard to bear. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a film sprinkled with trashy, it's pretty idiotic to polish it with special effects and a new school edition. It seems that they take it too seriously. It's not fun because decent FX gore is wasted in this context. And where Gore's classic effects are fine, computer effects in scenes like stabbing in the mouth or shots in the end look pretty dumb (and the splash of 3D stinks even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists ). /> <br /> I often wondered if the time of the serious splash movies is over and "Barricade" is just another example, it could be time to put it in the grave. It is not fun, it has no character and it is too bad for its appearance. The script is a cheap test of "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" that lead nowhere. You can take that literally ... the ending is there and it's as random as many other things here ("I love you" in a splash movie ... come on!). "Barricade" tries to incorporate many things and fails ... you can quickly advance in this film to perform an extensive espousal, fusion of the acid face, nipple pinching and the classic Friday 13 style of stabbing a couple while you play a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). But it is very difficult to overcome this. The total failure, especially because you can see that it could have been something.
