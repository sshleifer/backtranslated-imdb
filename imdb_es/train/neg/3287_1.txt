If you change the name of this movie, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". To summarize, this film is nothing more than 88 minutes of two immature country punks that lead to the famous 1968 Dodge Charger in the city and in the country, chasing girls and circumventing the law. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of the "dukes" and what tarnishes the film is that the characters are out of tune. The excessive indignation, sexual references and the use of drugs have turned the good name of the "Dukes" into towing garbage. <br /> <br /> Side of comparing it to the TV show, the acting was horrible. The only actor who did well was the famous 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee. The others have exaggerated the role of the character that tarnished the film. <br /> <br /> The "dukes" have been another victim of the transition tragedy from television to the big screen of Hollywood in the 21st century. Skip this movie and buy the television series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My rating: F
