The film has a nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his genitals exposed right in the center of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost thought it was meant to be fun, but we were seeing it with my mother and it was not fun to have THIS staring at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters are friendly. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really would not recommend this movie. I expected it to be lovely and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very educated and superior French family, and he despises these characters. <br /> <br />
