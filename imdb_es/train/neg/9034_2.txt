The story is a bit slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very well and I could not understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays her nasty normal role and Constance Bennett is regular, except for a couple of her screams, which were fun. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish I had more lines, since it disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon looking so young. I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late 60s to the 80s and an old crushed woman. In regards to the story, the best part could have been the last few minutes when we see a double doing amazing things on skis, posing as Douglas falling down the slopes. That was an amazing and funny movie. <br /> <br /> In general, I can see where this film, the last of Garbo, was not a blockbuster. Simply drag too much, and go on and on about the deceptions. It is an annoying story. Garbo knew it too, and abandoned it.
