"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is another of those surrealist films that tries to look extremely sophisticated, but all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other films of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. However, cinematography sucks, so there's nothing at all to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> The video frame indicates that this film is "one of the most exciting visual adventures seen in the film". Yes, sure. It's up there watching events as stimulating as a melting ice cube or a turtle walking a mile. 1/10
