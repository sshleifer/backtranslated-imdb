I expected much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for it to end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc ... There are gangsters, gangsters, who carry out successes. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful tips when you're watching movies: as a general rule, if there's too much exploitative excitement, then you know that the movie will be a failure. Caprica has a lot of this. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his bad skills by throwing some naked bodies. It never works and all it does is degrade the (very) young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them. The directors / writers who do this must be expelled from the business. <br /> <br /> If you want to get bored for an hour and a half, of course, rent Caprica. There is (free) pornography on the Web if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go ahead, there's nothing to see here.
