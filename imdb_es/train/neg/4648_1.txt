This is a bad movie by B who pretends to be a fake documentary. The documentary filmmaker porn in the film has almost as much screen and dialogue time as any other character. That completely destroyed any "documentary sensation" they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not really a fake documentary is the least of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing interesting to say about the porn business. It is not even particularly salacious. While there is simulated sex, nudity is moderate for a R-rated movie. <br /> <br /> Someday, someone will become a good impersonator of the porn industry. This is not.
