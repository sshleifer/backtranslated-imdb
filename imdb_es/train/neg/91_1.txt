I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I think I never finished it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man in a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember). I do not understand how they could have said that to be in the 70s. I could also have had a cell phone, I can not remember, it was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they were taking the film and if I could get back the time of my life. Today is the worst movie I've seen, and I've seen some pretty bad.
