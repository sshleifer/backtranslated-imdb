I saw this movie very late the night before and generally, if it's too late, I forgive the movies a lot. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie, it got worse and worse as the movie progressed. Even though I know it's supposed to be a comedy, I did not find it very funny. It was also a particularly unreal and jaded portrait of rural life. In case this is what any of you think life is in the field, it definitely is not. I have to agree that some of the cast members were cute, but the French was really fake. I have to agree that he tried to have a good lesson in the story, but in general, my recommendation is that no one over 8 see it, it's too annoying.
