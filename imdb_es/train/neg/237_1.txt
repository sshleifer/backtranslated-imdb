After being enormously entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a member of "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rate 10/10 in general: casting, acting, script, story, editing, rhythm, music, emotional impact, etc.) , I eagerly anticipated this movie. I was enormously disappointed. It is a script that reads, not a movie, vulgar for being vulgar, bankrupt in all aspects for which "The Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Blame the screen by writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part"; never came I did not laugh or cry, although a line of dialogue made me smile. Is it $ 7? Barely.
