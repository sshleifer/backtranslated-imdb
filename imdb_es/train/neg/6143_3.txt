In fact, this is a pretty strange movie ... First, we have a former American gymnast who tries to become an actor (or something like that), and this seems to be the only role he had (that I know anyway), and for good reason. While it achieves the role well enough to maintain some interest, it is a rather insipid and flat performance. Second, we have the SMALLEST sound effects ever used in a movie. I'm not kidding. This only makes the film extremely comical, but in that way annoying. hehe And third, although we have a cast of support with a generally decent performance (including the hot chick required!), a story not really so bad and some great images; The dialogue, the fight scenes that involve gymnastics (hilarious!) And the general execution of the plot are weak. This movie would have been barely better than a TV movie on the net (a shame that Fox was not present in 1985). It's one of those movies that is just plain bad, but you can not resist watching it and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that you've found the perfect eternal home on television and the nightly cable.
