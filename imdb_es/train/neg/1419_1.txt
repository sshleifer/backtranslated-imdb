This is a horrible little movie, and unfortunately, the company that made this short film made several others. The short is essentially an idea of ​​a joke that, to begin with, was not funny and can also offend you. It certainly made me feel uncomfortable to see very young children (most of whom looked around 2 years old) chatting and pretending to be adults, in this case, a dance hall girl and clients from the bar room. It's the kind of humor with which you'll be forced to laugh at your own children if they pretend to be adults, but I can not see anyone who WANTS to see this, especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a pretty furious style. Get dressed and act like a vampire! And then, other children act like adults in some rather adult situations. At that time, I'm sure they were not trying to attract pedophiles, but when we look at them today, that's what comes to mind right away! Because of this, this boring movie ALSO scared me and I hope I never see her again. Quite strange and quite horrible.
