This movie is very, very, very poor. I have seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of tension, but not much to make you jump out of your chair. Start slowly with the construction of tension. What is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although in some points or moments I must say that it was a little funny when people were shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They must have done something like Scary Movie, so it could be a better movie. Because I saw only pieces of the movie skipping scenes and got bored through the movie. I must say that I felt sleepy watching this movie, so I can say it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time not even thinking about doing something with this movie, besides leaving it where it is. . Somewhere very dusty ..
