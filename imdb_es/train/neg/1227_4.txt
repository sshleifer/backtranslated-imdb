Although many people here praise this movie, I must warn you. It has no logic. I think Basinger does a decent job in acting, but you can not do a thriller if there's a great lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene shows you a good picture of the movie: while Basinger is chased by murderous thugs who decide to sit down and contemplate an image that she finds in her pocket. The picture is of his daughter and says: "We love you, Mommy." Who does something like that? What the eff? And believe me when I say it's not as stupid as other scenes in the movie. Someone said that this is a "hidden gem". Well, I have to totally disagree, this movie has been kept hidden for a reason. And it is not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. My brain hurts: D In general, the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this movie is basically possible only because of the lack of logic. But, I still give it a 4 because even though it has a shamefully flawed logic, it has a certain state of mind that kept me watching until the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to see this, you know you have been warned.
