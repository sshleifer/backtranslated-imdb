Nell Shipman attempted a conspiracy to bring an end to persecution in "Return to the Country of God" the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time, she does it better, although it seems useless. "Something new" hardly has a plot that is outside the pursuit. There is a brief premise, which establishes the hero (co-author and boyfriend of Shipman) so that he has to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it is nothing more than an exciting and implausible pursuit from there. Of course, it's played like a one-hour ad for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is ridiculously ridiculous. It does not seem that she learned much from D.W.'s last-minute rescue films. Griffith or her parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she is imitating. <br /> <br /> A point of interest is that Shipman writes and addresses the film as the writer of the film's story, which features a writer (Shipman again), although it does not make much smarter or humorous with that, although I try. Again, others had been pioneers in the joke of the writer in the intertitles, as Anita Loos with 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with 'A Girl's Folly' (both of 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that he does not take himself or the film seriously, and neither do I. "Something new", in spite of its affirmation, is trite.
