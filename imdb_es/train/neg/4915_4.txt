One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seemed to be no middle ground for Love Story's opinions; One loved him or hated him. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions on the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie has a rating of 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland does a fabulous job like Oliver's father. But the film did not work particularly convincingly when telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to justify multiple presentations, at least, not for me. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal, I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet, because most of them, but not all of them, are ruined for me by their presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc?, In which his direct interpretation is the perfect underlining for the protagonist of Barbra Streisand's nonsense, and, not coincidentally, take a chance on Love Story just in case! McGraw and O'Neal tend to assault their lines, instead of interpreting them. <br /> <br /> This movie is notable for the start of a good career: it was the first Tommy Lee Jones movie.
