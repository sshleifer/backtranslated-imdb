A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and the dialogues are badly written, the direction is mediocre and the edges act on Hammy. This film clearly aimed at the crowd of Rang De Basanti, but it is very far from the brand because it has not one of the elements that did it. RDB connects with its excellent audience script, excellent acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to that close masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back by resorting to scenes such as the hero filtering into the villain's Persian carpet and the hero's mentor looking at bullets in a truck, nothing less! All this could have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a decline in the quality of the film and bad films like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became great successes, but the creation of films has become something more subtle and thoughtful lately. <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He resorts to lecture without worrying about the intelligence of the audience to understand what he is trying to say. Maybe I should concentrate on the entertainment and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and that Mr. Santoshi should have left the offensive the industry to Om Shanti Om. Assault on the industry? It is true! Santoshi has described the industry as a place where they bite deeply, complain and cast iron couch in which the hero is pleased with a star called Curiously Sania. There are some people who will think that these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In general, raise your voice against films like this and do not spend your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * outside of ****.
