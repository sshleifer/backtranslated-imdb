Just fine, old man, stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not the stupid good like Killer Tomatoes, or the Ed Wood movies, this is probably the stupidest movie I've seen. Giving this movie a golden turkey is an insult to the turkeys. Calling this movie foolish is offensive even to fools. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, it is better to really start World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show later <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my only brain. <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
