I have seen many movies and I would rarely rate a movie as "1", but this movie was more than terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were not realistic and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I watch scary movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in house / forest / school / etc and then shout "Hi, is there anyone there?" - but at least they are credible when they do ... This movie could not even do it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog. I look like masterpieces that won awards from the academy. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who is thinking of watching this movie will come back to thinking. IT IS AWFUL!
