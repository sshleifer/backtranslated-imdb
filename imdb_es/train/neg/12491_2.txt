Hm While a nice movie to make plot holes, it signals the atrocious performance, the primitive special effects (at best) (all of which have made me watch this movie three times in the last six years), Severed It's among the worst seen I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen at the crime scene on the dance floor. In general, I do not like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyed, the rest is a mixture of confusing dialogues and images that do not make the story advance to a logical conclusion (which I can not remember anyway).
