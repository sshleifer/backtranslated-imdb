I wonder how much this movie really has to do with the movie "Bachelor Party" of 1984, starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie an official sequel? In all the departments this film is missing and it is obvious that it is better not to see it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie simply is not good enough or funny enough. It is based mainly on the stereotyped evaluations of the character, rather than the film actually presents some fun, original and fun moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also very little present history and the bare chest of the movie that the pages of script. You just keep waiting for things to finally start. There is a main plot line somewhere, but that one is so terribly unoriginal and runs so badly in the movie that it feels more like it's something that does not exist. I suppose there's even a message and a moral history somewhere, but this is also terribly unoriginal and badly done in the movie that just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sex and nudity jokes, only without the main teen characters, which makes the story even more sad and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes, which are out of place for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
