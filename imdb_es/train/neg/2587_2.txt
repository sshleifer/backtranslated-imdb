Okay, there are nudes, but hey, there is free pornography on the Internet for whoever likes it. And it's just silly how they forced the tits in each frame. I mean, I was ashamed, not because of the nudity, but because of the distance of the producers / writers of this garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is NOT funny at all, it is extremely predictable all the time. There is no plot, there is no dramatic content at all. This is much worse than the other cake movies and they are not so good either :) If you are really drunk or maybe a 13 year old boy who is really obsessed with tits, this might be ok, otherwise no. <br /> <br /> Always align with garbage of the same magnitude with regards to Erik the master of the MC flash mission
