The cover on the DVD and the album is incredibly amazing, you'd think they made a movie about the sweetness of twisted metal, which is still a great idea, but the actors in this movie are worse than Ben's at Pearl Harbor, the Porn movies have better quality and better actors. I was going to buy the DVD, but fortunately I rented it first, the plot and the script are also horrible, nothing seems to go well together, so the movie never makes sense. The bad attempts to scare you using flashback scenes are worse than those used in the comedy programs of the 80s and in the end will leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house.
