A famous master of the show enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old woman suffers a heart attack. The name of the murderer is Sawa. She still goes to school and works for a vicious criminal, Akai, who is sleeping with her. One day, Sawa discovers that he killed his parents. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action movie is a disappointing gore fest. "Kite" has style, but it's still garbage. The strange plot about a teenage girl who kills people like killers tried to scare and touch at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on her face. One of the highlights is a sequence of action in which the good / bad heroine Sawa is meeting with a bodyguard of a building, but the dramatic structure is not so well orchestrated and the strange and grotesque animation of the director Yasoumi Umetsu of the faces of the character. It's horrible. Not only that, the sequences of sex are just creepy. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
