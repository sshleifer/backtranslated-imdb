Anyone who has really been able to sit through this movie and walk away feeling that it was a good movie does not appreciate quality films. This movie was an insult, the direction was the quality of the high school film class, as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch project had a better picture and I hate that movement with passion! The plot had the potential to be a very intense, very good movie, but it fell from the first 10 minutes throughout the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this movie was about a child's imagination, that's fine, that's fine. But they could still have done better things with this script than they did. I mean, come on, the Indian in the store. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly imagined the Indian and the whole story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they mention to the store clerk and she casually says that there is nobody but me who works here, so you think the ghost of the spooky ghost is fine, but she just looks for the amount in the idol and we forget the child who sees this boy. . That was so lame that it goes beyond the pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this? This is a movement that I recommend NOT to see, there are definitely better quality films that will not insult your intelligence! Thank God, I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have demanded that they give me back my money! For those who were easily entertained with this movie ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of recording to say it was a good movie.
