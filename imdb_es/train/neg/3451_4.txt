Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. He was a great actor, from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban type. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the movie was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially because Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero throughout the movie. In a genre in which people expected a certain pattern, to break with it, the movie has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole city will allow Sinatra to do what he wants only because they are afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special cover that will open sideways so he does not have to take out the gun, one wonders if that will make him invincible, why have not all the shooters adopted it? I think this movie should not have been removed, because it's worth watching any movie with Sinatra and, despite its limitations, it's still nice.
