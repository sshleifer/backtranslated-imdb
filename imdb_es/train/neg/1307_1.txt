This was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of the Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I discovered that the first two films of 'Demons' were very entertaining: they were so bad that they were great, but this one is so bad that it's really bad. It's intensely boring, the story never gets anywhere and I hated the characters: the wife slapping the husband and the weeping weeping pain in the *** made me crazy, there was nothing close enough to the story dedicated to the Ogre that I was probably the best actor in the whole movie. I turned it off approximately three-quarters of the way because it was very, very boring! Do not bother yourself
