I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. I felt like I was sitting watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they were thinking when they did this. He barely gets involved in Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and has no end. It felt almost as if they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos. It ends suddenly and you know there will be another episode next week. I also felt that I just watched part 1 of a two part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they became lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to do a Dahmer 2. After watching this movie, they all seem to be very precise. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear this music sound, then the writing appears on the screen and tells how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by an inmate and murdered at the age of 34 years. Wow, he goes on a walk through the Woods to his death in prison. How about showing how he got there. What about showing Dahmer's trial? How about showing a little more detail. I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped everywhere. In fact, I found myself saying incredulously: "That's it, is that the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie to be made. I would like to tell the filmmakers that if they are going to do it, do it well.
