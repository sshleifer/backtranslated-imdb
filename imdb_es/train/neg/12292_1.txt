We brought this movie as a joke to a friend, and it could have been our worst joke. The movie is barely visible, and the acting is serious. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff providing poor performance. The plot is shameful and in some points we were so bored that we wondered what the hell was going on. Try to be scary in some places, but it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Simply terrible
