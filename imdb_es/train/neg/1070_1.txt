I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible, so boring, I almost got to the middle and could not stand to see the rest. A shame With talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer who has a one night adventure with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged his cat, etc, etc., so Branagh sends him to an asylum and quickly escapes. Somehow (I did not know how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed in the story that moves more slowly than the stationary one. I wanted to like this and, being a big fan of Grisham, I read all about this movie and (foolishly) I was expecting something interesting. Honestly, this is the WORST movie I've seen to date and I'd like to get my money back. * outside *****.
