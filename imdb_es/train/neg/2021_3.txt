Ronald Colman won an Oscar for Best Actor for his spectacular performance as a popular theater actor who is completely lost in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cukor's film, praised by critics, has a wonderful pedigree, written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, witty jokes become shy here, and the business behind the scenes is too mature. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for her score, and Shelley Winters has some good times as a tough waitress (when the theatrical Colman addresses her breathlessly, she asks him: "What are you, some kind of nut?") . Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly risky and not very fun. * 1/2 of ****
