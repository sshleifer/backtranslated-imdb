Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen! The acting, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot. In fact, I can not say anything positive about this, although I like Swedish films. The fight scenes are so ridiculous that it is impossible to take them seriously. And when the main character simply loses his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good movie. Regina Lund is the only actress of half descent, but disappears in an avalanche of laughable pronunciations and incredible reactions. It leaves you horrified that someone has spent time and money on something like this ...
