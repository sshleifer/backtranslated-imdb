- A small time hood tricks the local mafia boss with a lot of money. Of course, the mafia boss wants to get his money back and does not care who he has to kill to get it. The punk recruits his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If this sounds ridiculous, it is. The simple idea that this dune buggy punk that Izod carries could contain one of Rome's most powerful monsters is simply nonsense. Your friend may be good with a gun, but he faces a group of trained assassins. The old mobster is little more than a comic relief and is not a real help when it comes to dealing with the Mafia. There is also a secondary plot on how the father of the mafia killed the father of a friend years ago, but it is not done and does not help the film at all. <br /> <br /> - The boss of the mafia, Mr. Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I guess he got the name because he has on his cheek what looks like a shave cut. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what he must to get a paycheck. <br /> <br /> - Recently I've seen some pretty good Italian crime / police movies, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.
