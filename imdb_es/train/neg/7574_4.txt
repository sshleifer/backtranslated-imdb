But it has a good action and a plot that is interesting. Nevsky acts like a bodybuilder and is not that attractive, in fact, in my opinion, he is UGLY. (Her acting skills lack everything!) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than they had given her, her character needed to develop. There are too many men in this story, there is no romance, too much action and a too silly ending. It is very violent. However, I loved the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that's an advantage. I also liked how I had some things about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to get my attention. The actors had to be more handsome ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most men, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us, ladies who are fanatics of the action, Nevsky just does not do it. In general, this movie was good, I did not love it or hated it, I just found it was another normal action movie.
