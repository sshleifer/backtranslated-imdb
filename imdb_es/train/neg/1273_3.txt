I have two good things to say about this film: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk offers a good interpretation (considering what he had to work in terms of dialogue and direction). However, having said that, I found this film extremely boring. Seeing the dry painting would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence, where everyone talks to each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything that is said on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is full of clich√©s and tricks, not to mention the endless incidents of Falk's audible flatulence. In addition, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to look for laughter or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but all reproduce to laugh. If Schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" attract you, you will love it. But if you expected something with more substance, see a different movie.
