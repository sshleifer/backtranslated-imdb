Five-year-old Michael sees his mother murdered by his father, the serial killer "The Highwayman," who later commits suicide. "20 years later", Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to the house of his isolated grandparents to "master their own fears" at a Halloween night costume party. Morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by Indian maintenance staff, is possessed by the spirit of the dead father and kills them with their phobias. The characters throw themselves out the window, drown in a toilet, eat rats, swell, etc. Morty becomes the father and a tree, walks and does stupid things. After finding a girl cut and put in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act happily, make jokes and have sex. <br /> <br /> The design of Morty is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees of the original Friday (13) is surprisingly charming as the grandmother, but this is even more foolish and confusing than the original and is full of false alarms, bad acting, characters with brain death, repetition of retrospective images and annoying distorted camera work.In addition, the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half black girl) are the first to die.
