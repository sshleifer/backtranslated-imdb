After seeing this in the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this movie borrows. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point, I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that, even though gas is not available, there is a lot in the abandoned gas stations, and the stations are close enough to maintain an F1 race car in the whole country.
