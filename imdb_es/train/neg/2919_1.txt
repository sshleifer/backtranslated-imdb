Well, as a gay man living in New York City, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the weak point of the gay culture that is described in this film, and I'm glad of that! If this movie was broadcast on television in the United States, there would be a great reaction against homosexuals and I can not say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average gay American or even the average American Trandgender, what they do represent is a total and absolute nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is appalling and the obvious racist feelings (anti-targets) are blatant and disturbing: you can not blame society for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and the rejection of education by part of the "cast" of the film: the actions of these people are not acts of despair, but rather a rejection of anything that resembles personal ambition and the will to do something from oneself.
