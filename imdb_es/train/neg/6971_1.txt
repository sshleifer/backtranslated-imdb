All this disconcerting waste of film needs is that Count Floyd appears every sixty seconds. Somehow, they reunited Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty on a set and could not get a real movie five miles away, about eight kilometers. BOY makes this thing suck. There is no line, thought, shot or original effect from the brainless opening sequence to the brainless closure. The magical and ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big insect - boring. If this is a horror movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously, every bad movie contains its own explanation of its evil. It is usually found in the opening credits: "Written, directed and produced by" a boy. Or at the very center of the action there is a bit of talent without talent that you know there is one and only one reason why this turkey was made. Here, it is not found until the last of the credits, where the cooperation of a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian government is appreciated. <br /> <br /> Right now I'm seeing how MST takes Yucca Flats Beast to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what's better?
