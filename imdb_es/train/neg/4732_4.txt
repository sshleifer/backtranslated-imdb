If I write a review about a movie, maybe it stays with me ... but in general I hope you've forgotten that I've seen it in just two weeks from now. So, why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... it was not a comedy of errors that always makes me tremble. It was just sweet fuzz ... and if you can not stand it, stay in the locker room, guys. I agree with those who defend this film because it will surely please its demographic goal and it will not be a total boredom for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good laughs here and there, but nary a side divider. Of course it is silly and just a little entertaining, but at least it does not stink (as many have said). Maybe those people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to qualify in the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually a good overall score in my book. Giving him a 4 makes sense and will reinforce his qualification at the time of writing this article. Giving him a 1 or a 10, as most have done so far, makes qualifying numbers meaningless. I can not believe how strong people feel in one way or another regarding this forgettable fuzz (or that I even bothered to write about that). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it should be borne in mind that Emma Roberts fulfills her Clairedycat role quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, often written in the roles of b * ch, does not disappoint when his character deserves it. You can also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, although his role is secondary. <br /> <br /> Surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. But, if there is a preadolescent girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and prepare to NOT hate her (you can even enjoy her).
