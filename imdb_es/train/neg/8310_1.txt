Another great conspiracy movie that tries to blame the US government. UU Already the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever been in the US Army UU You can see how fake this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, games and gestures are wrong. (And, of course, all senior officers are corrupt criminals or total idiots). Shameless propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted in recent years. Use all the clich√©s, rumors and urban legends of the gulf, all are presented as a gospel. (The truth is that nobody knows for sure why some GW veterans are sick and others are healthy as horses). PS: This is not new. The war is NOT fun and I know that the veterans of World War II, of Korea and of Viet Nam also have some very serious illnesses. (And the government has a responsibility to take care of all of them.) Tabloids like this will not solve the problem!
