It is not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION has little potential. In fact, the little explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and, at least in the first half, this effort by Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in a way that only corny horror can give. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's performance and the overly complex argument, this suspense game could lose its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, presented here before his fan base incorporated in the horror had accumulated. , it's the average guy Sam. Of course, average men do not stay average for a long time in horror movies, so after a well-made scheme of origin, we see that several parts of Sam's body begin to ignite. Soon she is also igniting other people, much to the dismay of friend Gal Lisa, relentlessly played by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the film implies a fired-up monster, director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwitting assassin. This approach gives the film an additional human depth that would otherwise be lacking, but also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We wonder if this would have worked better as a villainous effort against everyone like NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a fairly nominal effort when all is said and done. It will bring additional appeal to Dourif fans and those who can not get enough horror from the 90s, whether good, bad or intermediate, but only on a slow night.
