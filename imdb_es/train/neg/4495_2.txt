The spoilers of this and The Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep film, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was pretty good, fun, and I have a weakness for the Hong Kong fights. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life of the unhappy Cubist worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually, he is finally forced to choose between these lives by his actions: does he become an outlaw who fights against the machine, or returns to the safe and forgettable world in which he started? Interestingly, he discovers that once one is devoid of illusions, life rather stinks. He has his girl by his side and his companions in the blessing, but he eats processed marijuana, wears a sweatshirt and lives on a piece of truly horrible machinery. Still, the truth makes it free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of that first film was in the questions "what if it were me" raised in the mind of the viewer. What if he were capable of the impossible? What if I were "The One"? It does not even matter much what you are the example of The One, with a great title like that. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith became a wonderful bad man, as he embodied all the fear of authority we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as ruthless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This The film is not able to fully realize the ideas of the original film, and it does so with such lack of enthusiasm, such poor writing and such a poor edition that I can not believe that they have planned these changes When the dialogue is at a fifth grade level, with several long words written at random, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My brief list of characterization errors: <br /> <br /> The oracle goes from being slightly useful, if deceiving to completely obstructive without any real reason. <br /> <br /> Important "personalities" of the matrix are introduced unnecessarily: the master of keys, for example, was a nice idea, but not as interesting as a character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its "advisory" role, and does not get anything to replace it. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not particularly nice, nor would you really want them to run the world. <br /> <br /> Special effects problems: <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are useless and intermittent. In The Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose and that he had to become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is simply the character from the point of view of an especially badly drawn video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway looked pretty fake, and not so interesting. <br /> <br /> problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, the fight scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave went on too long, everyone in my theater row looked at his watch. Not because we care about good dances and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people who appear in the photograph, nor did we care. <br /> <br /> Any hack that wrote the creator's soliloquy should be on the business's blacklist. He wandered, he used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and it was a waste of time and a step-by-step killer. The creator's speech could have been made in a tenth time, and with more danger, since "Zion exists to give the rebels a place not to destroy the Matrix, now there are too many people who do not believe, the matrix is ​​in danger of crashing and killing all the people connected to it ... Furthermore, the Earth can not stand even the people in Zion, let alone the others ... You can choose a person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I erase the memories of the people currently in Matrix. " <br /> <br /> Instead, we have a lot of long and extensive twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript and try to divide the sentences. Each one is too long for several clauses, and uses words with clearer and shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have seen the third, and despite what some critics have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Reviewers who feel that the second and third films were "deep" should go see some really profound films. Maybe read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This movie is not hard to understand, but it is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Scott
