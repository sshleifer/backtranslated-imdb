My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although I had great actors / actresses, there were too many arguments to maintain interest. Also, it just was not that interesting. The dialogue was rigid and confusing, and the story became too much to be credible. I was quite disappointed with what I think was one of the latest Audrey Hepburn films. I will always love John Ritter better in slapstick. It was too pathetic here.
