I will admit it. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and she has set out to see all the movies she has been in (unfortunately, that includes the horrible movies of Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> This has to be classified as the worst movie I've seen. (Yes, it is classified even lower than the Avengers). all are lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE PLEASE do not submit to this movie. You will hate yourself the next morning for it.
