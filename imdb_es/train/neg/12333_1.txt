No-bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look as kind as usual in this, which usually makes me forgive his skeptical perfunctory performance. It's hard to believe that she was the producer of this dog. In addition Kevin Kline: what kind of suicide trip has his career been? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally this was directed by the guy who made Big Chill? It must be a repeat of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
