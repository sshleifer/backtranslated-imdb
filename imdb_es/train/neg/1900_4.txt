Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not completing an order for the British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The job consists of "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will execute his punishment. So Raines quickly assembles a team that he can trust and is in charge of the task at hand. But the police are with him and some of the cars on the list are not easy to take. It would seem like an almost impossible job to complete. <br /> <br /> He has lost a great cast in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. All of whom deserve something better. Enough acting power there to drive a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that this is a case of too many cars left in the parking lot, many characters, not enough. From the beginning, we have no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a Bonkers script mixed with loud noises and cheese whips, scattergun edition and subtly hammered by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a new version of the budget of H.B. The 1974 independent film by Halicki with the same name, with the premise of offering the potential of a movie based on an adrenaline car. Potential that unfortunately is never realized. There are one or two moments of high impact, of course, but pleasant, nonetheless, pleasant. But if you forgive the play on words, the movie never comes out of the first gear, it's happier to work with its large number of characters who care about trying to make the Bohemian script {Scott Rosenberg} work. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get some of it {cars are in sight}, just like fans of unintentional comedy movies {check the Ecclestone carpenter's pain moment}. But no, it's really quite poor in every way. 4/10
