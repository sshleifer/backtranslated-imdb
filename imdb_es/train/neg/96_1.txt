Oh, wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical snob in the movie, unless you want to review your typical movie definitions, such as "continuity editing" and "geographic matching". I could not tell where I was in this movie. A second is in the present, the next minute, supposedly, in the 70s, they drove a modern SUV and wore what I thought was the 80's style clothes. I think that. I could not pay enough attention because the performance was just horrible. I think he just got attention because he has a 3d that I did not see. If you are a fan of the B movie, and by B movie I mean the BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie and the nonsense style will keep you laughing while you can stay awake. However, if your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip this one.
