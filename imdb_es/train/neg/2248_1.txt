This movie is a huge smoking stack. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why someone felt that the Garland / Mason version should be remade, or why Striesand would have been the first choice to star. <br /> <br /> In this case, I have no idea why our people (gay Americans) tend to consider Stries as a treasure. At least in my opinion, she had reached her professional peak with Funny Girl and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent Judy's classic, or even the original (a good movie by right own), but, please, omit this stench.
