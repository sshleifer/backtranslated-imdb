Since many of the horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters do something stupid at some point in the process, the girls in this film would be collecting Gold, Silver and Bronze at an Olympic Awards ceremony. Darwin. A baboon with mental disability would have made better decisions than them, and would have shouted much less when doing it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy image, a deliberately amateur camera work (my 92 years old). -the older grandmother handles a camcorder with better results, an extremely poor sound and without discernible plot / narrative, then this is her ideal film. Also keep in mind that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women complaining for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this movie. For example: "We have to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can not believe I was talking to her, last night", "Did she call you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about some date they asked for a" "WHAT, how come she did not tell me?" As in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and a series of spooky weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that he did not tell me he was going on a date. <br /> <br /> Well, then the budget is low. That does not mean I have to make it look like it costs half the budget. The 'score' is interesting since all, with the exception of one, the tracks have been written and executed by the writers / directors of the film itself. In fact, it seems that The Duskfall, a Swedish death metal band, has spent the entire budget on a song. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing about everything in the movie is the ending that ends. We with the possibility of a sequel.
