I felt compelled to see this film until the end, since I found it in a gangue container and bought it on my own, but I went many times to turn it off and simply cancel the money I had paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is fine. If there is something that the creators of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickly effect. If that does not excite you, then get away. <br /> <br /> This film was shot on a domestic video camera, with primary school accessories and terrible actors. It's dubbed from German, but even given that, the sound is horrible. This movie is almost as economical as possible, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the movie could have been a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men landing on an island inhabited by an army of masked sadists. They are captured, and the rest of the film is about their attempt to escape. I call this a story in the most vague sense, since in reality it is a series of scenes of torture and combat united by a strange dialogue full of obscenity. <br /> <br /> There is nothing at all redeeming about this movie, unless I gore without mind. Consider yourself warned.
