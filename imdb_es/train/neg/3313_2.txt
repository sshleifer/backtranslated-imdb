How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy? If I had not gone with my heart, I would have fallen asleep and would have asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was in the wrong group. I like most girls movies, but I hated this one. This is the only time I saw such a surprise and I did not turn it on. Those suits were very exaggerated. Nobody talks like that anymore and I think they did not even do it. The dance part was horrible. My ex told me later ... "Did not you like that part? Did not you think it was sensible?" I said yes only to avoid his feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've seen.
