The IMDb guidelines indicate that you must declare if your comments contain 'spoilers'. <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is something like a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies what it warns against, a story about lost young people who do not know where they're going. <br /> <br /> I just saw this at the Tribeca film festival. This movie was not only bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√©d with little depth, and Farnsworth's acting was very bad in particular. <br /> <br /> From the paternalistic accents to the line of the meaningless plot, the 'graphic' elements out of place, even the dialogue and the repetitive scenarios ... sucked the big one. <br /> <br /> I think I was looking for a more modern and up-to-date "druggist cowboy" with a touch of "natural killers", but it's not as sensitive a place as the first or the other. so shocking (outside of some gore at the level of fraternity) as the staircase. <br /> <br /> more than anything, someone had to really A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things to build and clearly <br /> <br /> deals with a worthy subject ... if they give it to him in his attempt B) edit the film. If it was reduced to a core, it could be passable. <br /> <br /> I would go below 1 if I could ... as maybe zero Kelvin.
