When I was younger, I thought that the first movie was really good in childhood, so I decided to watch the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequels, because the first movie is usually the best, and it is. Basically, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed to leave the house because they are worried about Úrsula's sister (the octopus-clad villain of the movie) and Morgana approaches her. When the child leaves, he asks Úrsula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, as was her mother. This makes Ariel return to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story I could have thought a little more about. Suitable!
