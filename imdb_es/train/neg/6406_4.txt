An update of the parodies and jokes that you would have seen in a burlesque scene in the first half of the 20th century. It is a series of various jokes made. Some of them could tell their grandmother, others do not, but it's a pretty sure bet that you've heard them all before. For what it tries to be, it's not that bad. Before renting, remember that it is an older style of entertainment and has more value as a story than as comedy or emotion. Robin Williams has a couple of bits, but it is interchangeable with the other players.
