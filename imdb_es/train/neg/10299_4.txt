I must admit that I started to think that something would have to happen, besides the dead body in the first scenes ... and his disposition of him. I was wrong. It was a film work by Betty hits the Beach locked in the first part by Mordant Morven. I really do not care what young people in Scotland do these days, who cares, what drugs they take. Visually, the walk through Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was pleasant and surely the highest point for me. The nadir was the food store for her dead boyfriend. When the movie came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend committed suicide. Rename it "Bare Bitch Boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain". I'm a fool for putting up with these things.
