Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well-established "hero" that we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story does not work and I felt that it is not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so neat and tidy that everything (even the Arab clothes) seems false and for the serious spectator who thinks twice that this movie can be seen as a comedy. of the mysterious drama. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro is doing a good job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and fake looking. The story is not very charming, although it is a murder mystery, but who cares about the death of a crazy and vicious blonde over 45 in the Iraqi desert? The 'victim' is not pleasant.
