This movie is one of the most distorted portraits in history. Horribly inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of enslaved Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous workers that Japanese sadists killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "on the bodies of the white man," as the Japanese chief engineer put it. It is disgusting that such indescribable horrors committed by the Japanese captors are the source of a film, where the bridge itself is not even nearly accurate for the royal bridge. The royal bridge was built of steel and concrete, not of wood. What about the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and everything that it is supposed to represent. His friends were starved to death, tortured and killed by cruel sadists. Those who did not die of dysantery, starvation or disease are deeply hurt by the film that clarifies their dark times.
