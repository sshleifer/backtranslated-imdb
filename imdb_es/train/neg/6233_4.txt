Incredibly trashy karate / horror thriller with a lot of graphically bloody violence and gratuitous nudity, and a "plot" completely absurd and extravagant. This is a low-level entertainment and low level of interest that will attract only the spectators with particularly perverted tastes, but it is a happy thing and I must admit that I was not really bored while watching it ... (* 1/2)
