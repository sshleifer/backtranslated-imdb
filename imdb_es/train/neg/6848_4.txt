I must say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror" movie. I did not get scared even once while I watched him. Nor is it too much suspense ... I could not guess the end in the middle of the movie ... So, what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a really scary movie. .. I want other movies to stop copying (eg, The registered trademark: long hair). Please, give me some originality. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie.
