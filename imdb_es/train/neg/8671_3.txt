I saw this movie on March 21 of this year. I must say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev" .Plot is trite. He talks about Prabhat who lives with his father, his wife and his little brother. The movie begins when he saves a girlfriend. Anyway. Azhar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his younger brother. He makes a plan by sending a few men. They come to a school that pretends to be friends with Prabhats. Kill him that child. His father kicks him out of the house. Then come back. He and Aakash go to Kenya to look for him. Sunny has a good performance, Chunky was a nuisance at best, Naseerdun is wasted. Divya did well, Sonam was squandered, Jyotsna was squandered but she looked cute. the movie was cute. Too sad he had to have his character killed. The girl was cute but was annoying. The other child did it well. Allo did well. Kiran was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan did well. The cinematography is excellent both in India and in India. Kenya.Script is weak but has some good dialogues. It also drags. The movie. The music was good. I just liked a song "Saat Samundar" the lyrics of that song was good. The other songs were forgettable. Do not look at this. Rating-3/10
