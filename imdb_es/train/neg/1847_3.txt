SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you gather a group of people without talent to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any type of performance, production, plot, effects, etc. It goes out the window in an effort to create a "shock value". Now, do not get me wrong, I consider myself a connoisseur of "shocking" movies, and the most unfortunate / fat / most unpleasant is the best, but it's still nice to see SOME kind of talent from SOMEONE involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC narrates the life of Harry Russo, a junkie freak show that receives orders to kill from his ventriloquist dummy, Rubberneck. Follow a few bouts killing prostitutes and other random people, and screaming about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (that's "whores" for those of you who do not speak New York-that ...) and how he He wants to rape them in the ass. There are some weak scenes of necrophilia, very little blood and some nudity to mix things up a bit, but nothing you have not seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that redeems it. I can find in this delayed movie the often hilarious (unintentionally?) Shouts from our main man, Harry. He goes on and on and on saying that he wants to kill everyone and make them in the ass, and it becomes quite funny after a while. In fact, I almost feel tempted to believe that there is supposed to be some kind of homoerotic tone in this movie, with all the talk and constant takes of Harry running around with his dong hanging. In all honesty, that prankster is more nekkid in this movie than in the few girls who show something of T-and-A (and some full frontal, to a large extent). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is slightly fun as a 1 time watch, but I can really only recommend this to those who want to be able to say that they saw a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest, the title, by far, is the best thing about this garbage ... A generous 3.5 / 10
