I had high hopes for this film, because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first film) was absolutely fantastic, the safest low-budget film I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> But a lot of CLAIRE DOLAN is Absolutely pointless and flat. Scene after scene seems to mix randomly in the mix, without thinking much about the narrative or the character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why do you choose the trick at the airport if you want to escape from that life? Why then does she not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair so that it has exactly the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The filmmaker does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It feels like everything is improvised (although I understand that it was not like that) and the filmmakers simply held up a camera as if they were making a movie. Verite documentary. <br /> <br /> After the screening I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative options by condemning the film narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was an escape. <br /> <br /> It saddens me that the creator of a film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN made a film as unconvincing as this one and defended it with fatigue. old "political" clich√©s.
