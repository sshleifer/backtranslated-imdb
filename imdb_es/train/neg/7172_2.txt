They are a good cast and do the best they can with what they are given, but the story does not make sense, the actions of the characters are inexplicable and there are too many moments of involuntary humor, like when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces . from a phonograph record or when the witch is drunk to the rhythm of hip hop and then hit on the head with a bottle, she takes her hostage and pouts. The scene in which the witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together is established as a routine of 3 cranks, and the plot raises the question: if the witch wants to possess the soul of this other woman, why not? Does it just do it instead of guiding these people in this elaborate persecution? Do not miss the glasses of Christopher Walkin and his automotive explanation of life after death (paraphrased): "The ancient Egyptians - are materialists, they expected the body to last all eternity, like a used car you invented. Druids, they knew you could not drive in the afterlife, you had to go out and walk. " Eh The ending is absolutely indecipherable. It seems that they ran out of the movie.
