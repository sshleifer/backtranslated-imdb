Normally, I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important issue and does it relatively well, even though Katie Wright is an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if she was actually told to play the character in this way or is naturally irritating, but she did an incredible job of making it impossible for me to take care of Lexi. There is no other dimension to her apart from how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is to whimper. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has gotten out of control could be distressed, scared and in pain. However, all Wright's performance is based on incessant laments and laments, while the rest is a lament. I could not help feeling that the problem of this particular girl was not caused by the demon that is bulimia, but by not having a spine. I doubt very much that that is the point that the film intends to make.
