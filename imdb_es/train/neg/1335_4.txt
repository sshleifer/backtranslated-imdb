This movie was amazing! (It's not as good as Leif Garrett's masterpiece, Longshot) but it's still amazing! I thought Ashley looked very big compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought that they could dodge such places and almost get away with it? However, Dad was a bit stupid and Mom was too sociable with Helmit Head. I give it 4. Anyone who likes this movie should see Longshot.
