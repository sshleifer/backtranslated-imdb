All right. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you have not lived until you have seen the sun through Saturn's rings", while the midday sun filters through the window, when suddenly he has a nosebleed. Next, West is back home in a secret hospital, a gelatinous mass that melts and goes crazy and causes a voluminous nurse to run through a fake glass door. Apparently, West "becomes stronger as it melts", which makes as much sense as anything in this moovie irremediably puril and brain-adle. Then this silly "Army Brass", who looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) tries to hide the information, but the man walks around killing everyone he sees because he is melting. Attacks an old couple who fight because it is melting. It makes a terrible actress scream and moans helplessly for about 10 minutes because it is melting. It is melting because it is melting. The fx by sweeping Rick Baker is supposed to be the star here, but they just look bad. The film is badly shot and everything looks so dark and confusing that it is very difficult to understand what it is, it is not that it helps anyone. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this ?? : = 8P ps - "Did not you get cookies?"
