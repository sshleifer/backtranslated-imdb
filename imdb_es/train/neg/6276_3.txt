THE BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. It is not a slasher or full of blood. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this exciting French thriller and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist, Gina McVay (Lena Headly), crosses into a strange world, since her life seems to be out of control. While attending their father's birthday party (Richard Jenkins), guests are surprised when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason. Things get really strange when he sees a woman who is the image of herself driving down a street in London in a car identical to his. Gina sneaks into her doppelganger's apartment and finds a picture of her with her father. She walks away and is involved in a collision. Then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; To be exact, family and friends are not easy to trust for her. Is Gina next to her? Is she in a parallel world? Your nightmares become more horrible ... is it broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos if you can solve this ... it will not be easy. The edition could not be more strict. The lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
