I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do it. Some movies, especially horror films, are so cheap that they are good. A ninja scarecrow who can do cunning and who can implement ears of corn as deadly weaponry ... definitely fits this "budget for brightness" system. The depth of the film is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats really drives the spooky ... ninja ... puberty ... students before thirty years of age ... the non-cowboy drawing ... the son of a bitch's scarecrow in the spotlight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is, 'you can dig' and I recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this kind of hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT HELL SMOKING !?
