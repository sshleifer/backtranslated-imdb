This film story is bad enough, what can happen in real life. I am very unable to understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and could do everything she wanted, then why did she fall in love with that bad man? 2. How can the script of the story be so weak? She was so rich, she can do everything she wants, but she does not dare to divorce her husband, that is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I LOVE YOU, did not mean anything in this movie.
