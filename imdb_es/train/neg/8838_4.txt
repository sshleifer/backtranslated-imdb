Are there similarities between "Lawrence Jindabyne" by Ray Lawrence and his latest film "Lantana"? A corpse and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a grim manner that will leave most viewers dissatisfied, perhaps even cheated. <br /> <br /> The story - the consequences of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river, is based on a story by Raymond Carver. It became an element of Robert Altman's classic set of 1993 "Short Cuts". Lawrence uses this theme to explore and expose relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The film raises some moral questions: "Would you let the discovery of a corpse ruin your good weekend?" and more poignantly for the Australians "Would it make a difference if the dead person were Aboriginal?" The performance, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by disturbing music, not like "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis of a great movie, get ready for a disappointment, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thus eliminating the element of mystery. And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank ending.
