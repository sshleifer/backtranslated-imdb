I saw this recent film by Woody Allen because I am a fan of his work and I try hard to see everything he does, although the criticism of this film made me expect a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confusing movie that can not decide if it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the crisis of middle-aged women. It fails in all three. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has married in great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather bored husband and two small children. This concept of a rather mundane plot is animated with such improbabilities as an old Chinese healer who makes her invisible with some magical herbs and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, what about something more prosaic, like a romance with a saxophonist? <br /> <br /> I was never quite sure what this confusing confusion was trying to say. There are only a handful of really funny moments in the movie, and the ending is a really absurd touch of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Rent 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a superbly well-made movie that manages to combine comedy. With a serious consideration of ethics and morals. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan."
