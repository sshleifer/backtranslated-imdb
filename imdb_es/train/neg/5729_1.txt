This has to be the WORST movie of all time! The acting is more terrifying than the movie. A lot of blood, but you do not know where it comes from, because they do not even show you the cuts. I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laugh as if we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a shame for horror movies! On the one hand, if they are in Asia, why is there a white policeman who goes through Waste Management trash cans? There is so much of another language that you do not even know what happens half the time. The editing of the movie is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working at the window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE! NOT TO SEE WHAT BAD YOU WILL BE, WE ARE SORRY WHAT YOU DID!
