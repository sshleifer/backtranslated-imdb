A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country simply does not understand it. They never did it. And liberalism continues to fall more and more into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film is about a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a group of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join their cause. Not only some of them join the cause. The moment your movement reaches its peak, entire leagues of professional and university sports will have to cancel their seasons since no one will play more. Just to advance this review, I am prepared to grant you this premise. Even though it would never happen in a million years, I imagine I could do it, and then I'll go from there. <br /> <br /> I do not remember how, but some kind of agreement was reached and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly silly and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me say that this film is badly written, acted and directed. Even if one agrees with the child's position, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the movie was built. And that's a shame, since there are many good actors that are wasted. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does it as well as he could have done with his character, and I would like him to try to act in more movies. Unfortunately, it is much easier to find work in the world of NBA coaching. You want Mr. English to teach more of these NBA guys today how to shoot the rock a bit better. Alex certainly knew how to pass the ball through the basket. <br /> <br /> As for the message of the movie in question, you're wrong. Plain and simple. All those nuclear warheads hidden in those missile silos in the west WAR PREVENTION !!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest a real war or the USE of nuclear weapons. These weapons, in fact, were never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. Neither side during the Cold War was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what could have happened between the US? UU And the USSR. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film obviously wanted the children of the United States to take up their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. Children in the United States, however, are smarter than the eaves on the left that created this dreck. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stay with Dr. Strangelove, instead. <br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
