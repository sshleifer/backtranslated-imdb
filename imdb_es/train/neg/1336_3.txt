This movie was definitely not one of the best films of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it, and I was a little disappointed in that movie. For some reason, it looked like it was a movie they put together very quickly. In some parts, it became so boring that I had to overtake it. He had no mistakes or interesting parts like his other movies.
