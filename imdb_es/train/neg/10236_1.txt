Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of film purists choke on their latt√©s, let me elaborate. As much as I enjoyed it, this is just one of the worst movies I've seen and it's certainly the worst movie I've seen in the movies (an impressive statement, since I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two clues (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and, in the worst case, terrible. Of course, they were not helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and a characterization as compelling as the OJ defense. The plot (to stretch the term a little) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, although undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously formulated. The plot there revolves around a model of twenty-something years (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like pieces of disconnection and the emphasis was placed directly on the impact instead of scaring the audience. While there really are very, very few positive aspects to draw from this movie, its redeeming features are the flaws that make it such a terrible movie. I've never heard a more vocal audience in a movie theater. After twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout the entire process. For my part I left angry with laughter, animated by a movie that had risen to the top of the dreadful filmmaking. Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a model for future aspiring directors who painstakingly detail how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. I forgot to mention that I managed to get into the movie for free ... so I can afford to laugh at that. I was still tempted to ask for my money back ... it really was that bad.
