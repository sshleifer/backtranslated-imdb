So I wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of conventional comedy that this country recognizes are slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was completely different (let's be cool and cutting-edge) and I left The Other Side with little to show. I bet One Small Seed went crazy over this. I know SL did it. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have the comic skills to achieve it. Even Danny K had better timing. Actually, I'm serious. Each time they presented a small character, he thought: "Damn, this person should have been the protagonist!". <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that the work of the camera should be horrible. White and black did nothing for this movie; in fact, with such a flat dialogue that this hurt even more by relieving boredom. The black and white was not crispy either. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Oddly enough, I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition was magnificent, maybe that's why the shortcomings of this film remain in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was more fun than the clues even before he said anything, talked about this movie and not about David: look at it and you'll understand.) I bet the guys who organize Oppikoppi were dismayed. One would think that nothing happens there at all, I have the feeling that it could have been filmed in someone's back garden, I know normal guys who have much more fun, more rude and more witty conversations than any of these "comics". However, the guy with whom they connected was fine. <br /> <br /> I guess the SA comedy will stay a little more in the Stone Age. Good job guys.
