The plot offers a slight interest: the title, by the way, refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a ranch. The family property of his pursuer, the cavalry agent Madison. The younger brothers of the latter are determined that the injured party, now under their charge, take them to the responsible gang leader; Ultimately, is the identity of either mystery man a surprise? and both, ironically, get involved with one of Madison's sisters (another is raped during the raid). Rosalba Neri, a Euro-Cult star, seems unremarkable as a lounge host and former Madison flame.
