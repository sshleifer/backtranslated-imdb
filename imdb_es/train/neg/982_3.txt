The true star of this ridiculous story is the glorious Technicolor. A visual treatment for the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and the heart. At first, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​Dietrich and Boyer abandoning religion to "find" their capacity to love. What follows is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe overcomes his performance, sometimes his face is afraid to see him, an insensitive mask. As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the liquor of the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse): when he abandons his "marriage with God", the reaction of his fellow monks has the impact and fear perpetuated by organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was well rid of his past. However, the journey that follows is too predictable.
