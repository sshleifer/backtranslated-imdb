If you're looking for treats for the eyes, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live artists. The visuals are nice and interesting to watch throughout the film. Now, saying that, the images are the ONLY thing in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I expected this movie to improve, but it never achieved any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to leave continued to grow and grow. Now, I have over 2000 movies and I've probably seen that number five times. However, this is only the second movie that I wanted to abandon all my life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- there is none. The three main artists are regrettable. Jude Law (also in the other movie he wanted to leave) is horrible in the main role. I'd rather sit through Ben Affleck in Gigli instead of seeing Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries so hard to be a fan of the campaign, it turns on his face. The last article I had read said that Paltrow is thinking about staying at home and being a mother instead of acting. After this presentation, I would applaud that decision. <br /> <br /> History --- The soap operas are better written. The story behind Sky Captain begins badly and gets worse continuously as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Directing --- none. Everything was put into special effects that history, acting and direction suffer greatly. Even "The Phantom Menace" had a better performance and that is NOT saying much. <br /> <br /> I would have to give this movie a "0" of "10." Avoid paying theater prices and wait until the video is released.
