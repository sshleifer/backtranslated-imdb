This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. This film matches the quality of films like "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those had renowned actors where it fell short. The "sweet eye" of this movie seemed to be a 50 year old woman with a bad facelift. (Just an example of quality). I would have rated this movie negative if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that men were not bad at looking, but not at all. If you were planning to go see this movie, I would strongly advise you to save your money.
