Except for the performance of Meryl Streep, who is remarkable as always, I would avoid this film because it has a quality dated in "Movie of the week". But it is worth seeing them if you consider the different gravediggers: how a couple endures the scrutiny of the media and how the different ones are treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the problem is the credibility of the different ones. We Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically do it with an air of "weirdness" about them. The couple involved is religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventist (different). So your lifestyle and your mentality are suspect to begin with. Dingoes are different animals than other dogs, so again we are faced with strange questions. The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treat different people, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say is suspicious. <br /> <br /> It's hard To hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" Without laughing and there are comic messages, sadly, throughout the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie, it was discovered (as you will find in web searches) that older children have been harassed by dingoes. Research conducted by experts in dingoes has shown that not only was it possible but it was more likely that the baby was taken by dingoes (perhaps a couple), extracted from clothing by experts and eaten in moments without a trace. <br /> <br /> However, what remains behind is the question of why people defended the dingoes when it was discovered that they were endangering the children instead of killing the dingo to save the children, Why, since the affection (expression) of a woman is so cold, is supposed to be guilty, and again and again. <br /> <br /> Disquieting questions, with or without the movie.
