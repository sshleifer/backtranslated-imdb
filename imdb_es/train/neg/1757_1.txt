Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was a man who deserved his gold medal in the Olympic Games, it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how is it possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the real one? The story of Dan Jansen is really amazing! Especially when you watch this movie through the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate, his technique, the dimensions of the speed skating oval, everything is wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves something better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
