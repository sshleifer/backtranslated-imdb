Do I need to say he's a stinker? (I gave him a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Watch him only if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of landscapes chewing and doing well, but nothing else happens in this movie. There is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets are revealed, nor a real threat to the well-being of the heroine. A few disagreements, slight rises of voices, that's all. The secrets are nothing that can not happen to anyone, the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable for that point. <br /> <br /> The plot, as such, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a large ballroom in a vast mansion by an elderly widow woman, very wealthy, and a growing mother / daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the daughter of the older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can join the rest of the pieces well. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for your safety beyond a second or two. The reason why it is still maintained for years after Cassandra's death is a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything: cook, clean, serve the food, open the door, etc. Everything except, apparently, closing the door, since that would be the only explanation of how one of the characters simply enters a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that makes you grab the arms of your chair and lean forward on the edge of your seat, because there is not a "growing" tension in this movie, only insipid and pathetic revelations that are they eliminate from time to time. <br /> <br />
