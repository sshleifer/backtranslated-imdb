I'm not sure why this movie seems to have received such favorable reviews. <br /> <br /> When watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the random and meaningless plot that was happening on the screen. The entire film seems to be nothing more than an exercise in senseless complacency, of an artistic nature on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / writer has a nickname of a single name reinforces this sense of pretension. <br /> <br /> Those interested in independent films will be better off looking for something better written and I would dare to say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.
