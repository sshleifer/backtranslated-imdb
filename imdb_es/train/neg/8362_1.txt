This is a really bad movie. I have wrecked my brain and I can not make a positive comment to do. The acting is atrocious. I have seen more credible performances in cable access. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks everything that comes close to him should have been, for the worst case, a cheese fun. The Night of the Sharks is not so bad, it's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it had been written seconds before being filmed. And to make matters worse, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've heard. I'm surprised that my ears do not start to bleed because of the sounds synthesized by the techno of the 80s that someone really bothered to record. <br /> <br /> Of all that I have read, the Italian film industry had died in 1987. Night of Sharks is like a last nail in the coffin.
