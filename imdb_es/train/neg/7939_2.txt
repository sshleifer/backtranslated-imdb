From the decrepit ranks of the subgenre 'Hillybilly Horror', which is already saturated, this sad story of a family on vacation terrified by imbecile peasants emerges. Sounds familiar? Well, it definitely should be for anyone with a superficial knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all the old worn-out clich√©s (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned into assassins armed with weapons when the push appears, the rebellious daughter, the only 'monstrous' who has a good heart, etc.), but even that half does it to make this a total waste of time. This is something that can not be forgotten, but humorous enough as a protagonist of J. D. Hart, once he starred in a movie called "Films that Suck" at the beginning of his career, a rather ironic presage. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
