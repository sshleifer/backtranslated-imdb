We all know that innumerable problems have adorned the slasher genre of the 80s and that often deserve nothing more than our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit hasty but damn if "Slaughter High" was not terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher movie. More or less, the plot involves a child who experienced a humiliation of rain similar to Carrie's in high school and returns to the ruined building to seek revenge against a group of ex-thugs who appear to remember. As expected, a masked madman kills them constantly on April 1 through electrocution, burning, hanging and chemically altered beer. I have a series of problems with the details of the plot and the configuration of this film, but considering the end, I feel the need to discard my complaints and I only say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any idea of ​​watching this movie ...
