A group of women who can not act sit, talk, smoke marijuana. They have another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because it is deformed, and from time to time they kill someone to feed this person with human flesh that really looks like a shop-bought ham that they dressed by sticking some plastic fingers . We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the ground, covered by a bloody sheet. I can not eat Spam cover anymore for a sheet. Only the thought of Spam covered with a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic attack provoked when trying to cross this entire film. Occasionally, there are scenes inserted randomly from a guy who is "hunting" them by torturing a guy who tied a chair in his basement. He never explains why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sisters sitting on the couch. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" type that is going crazy. He bitches blood and hits through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is not explained or linked to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, there are no special effects, there is no history. If you want to see some boring people talking in a deep way about anything while you're sitting and eating ham and smoking, here you have 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where a girl gets hooked in a corner and the aforementioned random scenes , absolutely NOTHING happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them move some things, including the deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. It is one of the few times that you are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
