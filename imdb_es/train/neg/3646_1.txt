Oh ... my ... god ... this is without a doubt the most brazen movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie just does not make sense. Combine this with a mediocre direction, really strange scenes (like the one in which the child stretches over the ravine and falls mysteriously) and a completely abysmal dialogue ("Look!", Musta peed in his pants! ") , And you get a complete failure ... Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas seems to be able to defeat is a case of chocolate bars, but this is part of the movie's charm, sit down and watch with some of your friends. to laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, because it's SO BAD!
