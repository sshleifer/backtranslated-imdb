Well, it is not often that we, in the United Kingdom, have a film about the life of the city center from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community, the last example I can remember was the undervalued Babylon in 1980. Then I had many expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that has been touted as the British version of La Haine! Well, La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film an authenticity that has been lost in other British films in recent times, but my concern is that this film ends in a predictable way with sadness. <br /> <br /> The film deals intelligently with the The growing problem of violence between blacks and blacks is, unfortunately, all too common in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers now use the casting of guys in the plot instead of the characters, which is just as harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be entertaining and inspiring for all of us, but unfortunately he got lost and created a movie that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black man in London, the only future is violence and the tragedy.
