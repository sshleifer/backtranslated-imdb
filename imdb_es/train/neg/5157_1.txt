I really despised this movie when I saw it at the age of 6 or 7, since I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing I could do was bad. Until this This complete garbage ruined Robin for a long time. I'm just recovering recently with its fun part but it would be on the parents' day, but then it kept making another mistake, Bicenntinial Man, I think it was called, but the point is. Robin should already have much better jobs and now he has returned to the execution of the slob that originated with this "classic".
