Somewhere, out there, there must be a list of the worst gay movies of all time. One who has too long camera shots of the stars sitting and pensively looking into space, or one where they focus unbearably long on kittens eating spaghetti. This image of motion sickness is the story of a boy and a boy, they live, they love, they swim, they get stuck in caves and one of them has a depressed mother and the other does not have a mother; they talk, walk, swim, have sex and have sex. It gets drunk and then it breaks and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then it goes out and there is a lot of progress and fast backward movement, and there are many thoughtful photos of one of them looking at space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's a tricky type of filmmaking technique or maybe the film is so bad that they have to fill it with long and wasted shots because otherwise, if they had to trust the plot or the story, the film would last about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, this is the thirtieth gay movie I've seen in the last 6 months and some of them (most) have been very formulaic, predictable and boring, but this is one of them is a terrible waste of The best up Now it was "Beautiful Thing". Then, I saw this and after the first opening shot that was sustained and delayed, I thought "Oh, no, it's going to be creative, sinny mah". But I gave him a chance. I saw it and then, when it was over, I threw the DVD in the trash. I'm sorry, I did not like it and if you did, I'm sorry if I offended you.
