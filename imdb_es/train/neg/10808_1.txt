I was given the book version of Kazaam for my eighth birthday, and people always say that the versions of the books are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's over soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, what I expected from a movie with Shaq that plays a magical rap genie coming out of an old ghetto blaster (which was probably a good reason why he was there). The boy in the movie that plays Max is a whining and a terrible actor. He is harassed by the children of the neighborhood, which I do not blame them because he is a little imbecile. <br /> <br /> The story is simply stupid and extremely clich√©. About a child whose father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and, finally, helps him reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at 8 I thought it was a stupid idea. It's a surprise that any of the people who worked on this movie had careers after the room because it's a shame and should never have been done. I could dig deeper into how this movie stinks, but you should know by simply reading the plot.
