I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I guess seeing it on the screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews point out how stupid the Detention is, but many neglect to point out the positive aspects. <br /> <br /> Any movie in which at least one annoying teenager dies can not be so bad. Why do so many films that have a cast of teenagers always have to include stereotyped teenagers? Are not there other types of teenagers? Do all groups of teenagers have an angry black man? A nerd genius that nobody likes? A horny girl who is very friendly and (in this film) is pregnant? A disturbed white antisocial child from a broken home in which everyone agrees has talent (but what is talent?). And a relaxed black child who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic children trust him. Then add a couple of fungible generic teenagers of any color. They do not say much, but they shoot at some point. <br /> <br /> The arrest would have been better if the bad guys had come to blow up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally kidnap a truck full of drugs, they sit inside the truck kissing. They drive the van to school because they want to paint the truck again in the school's paint shop, but they never manage to paint the truck. By the way, it would have been easier to put all the drugs in another car or two cars or in another truck or truck and drive without repainting the Police Van. Also, they never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the high score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide that they have to kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), although when the villains take over the school, nobody realizes it remotely because it is after the school schedule The handful of people who are still in school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, why go after them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this movie is that the villains are armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teenagers (including a guy in a wheelchair) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets. teens and it usually fails. Towards the end of the film there is a bloodshed. For every time someone is shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that fail. The tricks are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 million, and I'm surprised. When I saw the film, I thought maybe Lundgren had done it as a kind of charity work for a film school where he is the teacher. As maybe this movie was his end-of-year exam. It was a test to see it, but I passed it.
