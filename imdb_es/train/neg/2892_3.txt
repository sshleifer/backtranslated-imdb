The naked body of Ursula Andress is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have large bodies. So, why is the highest grade I can give a movie with such quality and quantity of nudes is only 3 out of 10? Because, to get to Ursula's amazing body, we have to sit in a movie that is otherwise not funny and boring (note that I saw the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American one, which probably eliminates many the strange material). In the typical tradition of Italian comedy, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army monster, the "Latin lover", the constant drunkard, the naive maid) that are not funny, simply exaggerated. Final word: look at this, but keep your finger on the fast forward button, you will need it. (*)
