Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the story of Cylon origin. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many lines of the story and obstruct it with too many POV characters that clog the narrative. The plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating the tension that could have had. In any given episode, little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier who uses a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only work prototype is driven by AI's version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide attack caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), a clandestine monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (Commander Adama's father of "Battlestar Galactica") is struggling to keep his family together while searching for the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (which looks a lot like the 1930 Chicago one). <br /> <br /> In addition to the bland writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many stories of origin. We already know how it ends (that is, the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
