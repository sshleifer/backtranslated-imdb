This was, in short, a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly awkward; I could not feel any feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too quickly and felt out of place. They could have been cited by the statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist and seeing an American Rochester felt strange. He could at least have tried to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but this just did not work. I felt as if I was watching the highlights of Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story had come together at random without taking into account the flow of the story. The stage and the music were very nice, but I felt nothing of the passion and love that is supposed to be between Jane and Rochester, and the movie left me totally immobile. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two are brilliant adaptations.
