Another violation of the story <br /> <br /> This movie is a catastrophe; just use a historical story and make a sweet love story, with poor performance and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 of the time, they just dragged the time to do a mini series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the solders become stupid, the costumes are a catastrophe. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest, in this film the Romans choose to fight on the side of the city, I mean to be realistic. <Br /> <br /> And the way Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means a person with fair skin.
