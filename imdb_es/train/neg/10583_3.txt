I'm sorry to say this, but the acting in this movie is horrible. The dialogue sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time. Maybe I got the "general trial" version by mistake. The director makes excessive use of slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the low performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the fight sequences are really better than I've seen in many action movies. The fights seem quite real. But all this happens while two main actors, again and again, miraculously survive incredible amounts of automatic weapons fire, grenades, assaults and bazookas. Enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I've seen, especially when they have in sight the truck that escapes from about 30 meters, and each shot of bazooka is wide by at least 50 feet. Those bazookas need a serious calibration of the site.
