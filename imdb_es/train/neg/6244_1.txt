Mario Lewis, from the Institute of Competitive Enterprises, has written a definitive 120-page rebuttal, point by point, line by line, of this mendacious movie, which should be titled "A CONVENIENT LIE". The address of the website where your report of discrediting is located, which is entitled "GUIDE OF A SKEPTICS FOR A DISADVANTABLE TRUTH", can be found at: www.cei.org. A shorter version of 10 pages can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you read those demolitions, you will realize that the supposed "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than the scare of Y2K 1999, which Gore also endorsed, as did the pseudoscientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, based on a book written by the alleged UFO hijacker Whitley Strieber. As James "The Amazing" Randi does with the psychics, and Philip Klass with the UFOs, and Gerald Posner with the JFK conspiracy theories, Mario Lewis with the Al Gore film and the whole "global warming" scam.
