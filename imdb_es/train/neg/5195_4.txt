I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was eager to get hooked to another great series of cables (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that it was slowly eroding with every episode I saw of the first season. (It did not go beyond the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was not original, it was devised and the portrait of the blacks was shameful. The dialogue felt forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to be smart and modern. It was a weird moment when I actually made an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never developed enough for me to worry about them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been dragged in To catch a predator) and the expulsion of Hodes's daughter, Quinn, by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico was as unoriginal as a clich√©. I had to conclude that the writers were testing the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode after Episode I liked the characters less and could not overcome many of the technical flaws in the story. <br /> <br /> I added that I heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue watching this play. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good selection and writing, I suspect that this show will be a challenge for you, unless, of course, you are drugged and then all bets are canceled.
