Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and sets aside two key things: action and emotion. THE PRINCIPLE OF DOMINO presents Gene Hackman as a convict who came out of prison to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents, presumably they work for the government, but that, like most of the arguments of the film, is never made clear. Hackman asks many questions that NEVER receive an answer, so the movie does not get anywhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE blends ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but even that works against it. Kramer's address is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The acting is fine if Hackman shows that he is quite incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably unpleasant and Albert is well regarded as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the normally nasty Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's partner. A rarity, however, is the election of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. They tell us that he already spent a lot of time in jail and that he seems to be trying to put on a kind of southern accent. Kramer's idea of ​​making it look like trash from a trailer is to make him wear an ugly brown wig. It is a more suitable role for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
