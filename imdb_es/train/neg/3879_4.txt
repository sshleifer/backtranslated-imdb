Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the first space mission in the world to Saturn, but, of course, being a horror movie, things get ugly and he returns to Earth as the only survivor. Frightened by some strange condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his head, unless he consumes human flesh on a regular basis, he kills what is apparently the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring city to stalk more victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the premise and the effects of the monster and the blood are actually pretty good, but the spatial scenes stick together outside the NASA images and the hospital looks oddly like a warehouse. A very weak script, little development of characters and a poor performance in general prevent it from rising above being anything other than a mediocre slasher movie with the novelty of having a living candle as the killer, and more or less alone It has its bloody effects to maintain your interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for fans of the most hardcore monster movies.
