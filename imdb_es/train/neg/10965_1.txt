Actually I'm watching this movie while I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker," so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (I'm still thinking how I'm currently seeing it) that this movie. . . To put it mildly, it is very, very overrated. Again, very. <br /> <br /> It looks like a very, very poorly made student movie by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and who did not pay so much attention to the details. <br /> <br /> I do not want to continue talking about the different ways in which I find that this film is missing, but. . . all right . . . I just do not understand it (remember, I fully admit that maybe it is I who is the idiot here, not the filmmaker, for not having received this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very, very exceptional. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
