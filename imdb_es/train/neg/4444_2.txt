Dr. K (David H Hickey) has been trying to master a formula that would end all diseases and disabilities, but he needs living donors to complete his work. His doctor, Brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted into medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas), who is pre-law and plans to attend law school next fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah cancels things with her current boyfriend, who is also fucking Walt's lady (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his girlfriend's job). Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears in the middle of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard ... to "recover" Eddie using his secret and illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, horrific results are produced. Eddie's face is filled with massive warts, while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite that he can not quench. Soon, he may even be a threat to his father and his girlfriend ... They must stop Eddie Monster. <br /> <br /> The horror film, direct to the video, typically horrible, suffers a great lack of budget, acting and talent in general. . The premise, which seems an interesting festival of fear, is not fulfilled even as a zombie movie. Blood is limited with some chewing scenes, but most of the violence occurs outside the chamber. The use of time to advance the story can be really annoying.
