... this would have been what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad this is. If you have trouble sleeping, pass it on and I guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s, but he's calling him here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was bent out of reach of the camera because his belt was too tight. Duncan himself is more like a motorcycle than a boy wonder; in fact, he looks more like a thirty-something man who waits for Lowery to get under way to use the great cape. <br /> <br /> Driving a Batmobile that looks like it came out of the Used Car Lot in Honest Al at a price lower than the sticker price: the Dynamic Duo does not put much effort into hiding the fact that it is the Bruce Wayne's car they drive; in fact, several characters notice the series. <br /> <br /> The performance is wooden, the scenarios are cheap, the dialogue is terrible and if there was a script they were following, I'm sure it reads in the line of "Batman says something here" because it certainly It seems that they are inventing it as it progresses. <br /> <br /> The Batman utility belt is made of thin fabric with no apparent bags to hold your devices, in a scene when Batman needs a full-blow torch in which producers only put one in when the scene starts, so that he never sees them again. His hood is so bad that he can not even see outside of it and his ears are more like the foolishness of Easter rabbit discontent than anything that looks like a bat. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I'm not making it up). ), Batman replaces the counterfietary radioactive money that will burst into flames in the second that is exposed to the air as a reward for some hoods. It is radioactive so you can track it, the reason why it is so flammable is not explained. Well, unfortunately, the thugs open the package in a cardboard store. We know it's a cardboard store because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that seem to weigh about six ounces into the bells to knock them out, and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman points to a motorist passing through the middle of nowhere and taking his car, leaving the man to his fate and telling him not to worry . Because if Batman breaks the car, the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said that the car moves away from a cliff in a few seconds. It's not that the motorist who probably died of exposure when trying to return to the city of Gotham really cares. <br /> <br /> There is a tired secondary argument with the clone of Lois Lane, Vicki Vale, who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman. - he should have noticed that the Batmobile was parked outside Bruce's house-- or maybe he saw Batman and Robin running through the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - and everyone, except the youngest of the audience, will want to throw toast on the screen. If you are looking for a bad cinema, you could not achieve a better brand: if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman television series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
