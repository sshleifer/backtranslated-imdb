I qualified this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought that this movie could be very good. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" Said the trailer. Well ... it offended me, because this movie really sucks. It's just a comedy, since I laughed about two seconds during the whole movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have problems with who they are, but what is the point of adding so many gay scenes in a comedy movie, when these scenes are not absolutely fun? I guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice is: if you want to spend good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen. Millions of times, you'll be better off than seeing this mother of all the terrible comedies. It really is total shit.
