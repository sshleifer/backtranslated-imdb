How have I appreciated this failure of a sequel? All he does is throw balls! Worst of all, it does not compare even to the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the involuntary laughter go? Enough slapstick action in the field lasts too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this from a full shutout of nine innings. What's next, LEAD LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO THE SMALL LEAGUE? Ehh, could it be! Leave this on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This has had three too many strikes.
