I do not usually give reviews of a star, but the computer does not let me make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The initial titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 accredited producers. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, the abusive husband Kenneth returns home with his family in a high-level gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) has let the children run all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Basinger was 55 years old when the movie came out. Are these your children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve Della drives to the mall, a long scene that could have been cut. To fool the idea of ​​a rampant eeeeeeevil male aggression in the universe, she passes the American football players in full uniform playing in the pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Of course. For a bonus, she sees a vehicle with a sacrificed deer tied to it. <br /> <br /> However, we get some suspense in the driving scenes. It's raining and the traffic is bad. First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time. Then, later, Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point, turning completely to check the messy back seat for the phone charger. <br /> <br /> Wander through the mall, see an old friend from college, try to buy things but your credit card has been rejected. Gee, maybe her husband is moody because he broke up, but that's too complicated for the script. <br /> <br /> In the parking lot A lot is opposed to the most ridiculous gang in the history of the movies. A white boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go to the bathroom), a black, an Asian and a Hispanic. Imagine an Up with People company that has gone bad and you will have the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a weapon, she gives them an attitude. A policeman from the mall comes to investigate the commotion and is shot in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is full of people, people everywhere, and nobody notices. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car and, instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit secure area, she goes to a construction site, where she kills the four bad guys one at a time. time simply with the tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> GREATER spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> Drive back home. The car stops, so she walks through the pouring rain. Check the children, go down the stairs and, when her husband asks her questioningly what got her in the mall, she shows him the gun and shoots him point-blank. <br /> <br /> The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in Della's personal empowerment. Instead, we know that your children will probably spend Christmas in a foster home or a group home, because the State will pick them up while she responds to the murder of one of the charges. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicides in self-defense. The husband, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this on the cable. If I had seen it in a theater (was there a premiere?) I would have been furious. As it is, I am sad to see that talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas are wasted on garbage like this. <br /> <br /> However, a very good thing. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford has not received another written credit or address since this turd happened. There is justice in the world.
