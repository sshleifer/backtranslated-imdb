This is not a bad movie ... but it's the kind that your girlfriend makes you see. The story is not bad ... it only makes the hour and a half seem so long. It's hard for me to tear this movie apart because I really like the idea, but it was too long and thin in history ... too bad. The main character never seems to change so much from beginning to end. I mean, he goes through something that "changes his life" and he can barely break a smile. I really thought that Mac was really good. His strange rarity prevented the film from being a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "understand" this movie. If someone can explain it to me, I'd love to be informed.
