<br /> <br /> The movie "Slugs" is unique because the titular bugs are actually the good ones in this horrific tale of nature that went wrong. You see, these poor slugs have been mutated through the contamination of evil humans and they do not intend to do anything malicious, they are just slugs: slugs with sharp teeth that eat meat and excrete poison, but they are slugs anyway. The real bad guys are humans, who try to actively destroy our beloved slugs or overreact when they find them. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs. They were hanging in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere, this giant hand approached them and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this man runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, lights a fire, hits a bookshelf and cuts his hand, then fire And the volatile chemical compounds mix and your house explodes. How can you blame that on slugs? <br /> <br /> This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable. The characters in this movie include the silly sheriff who hates everyone, the drunkard who is mean to his dog, and the bulky fellow whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a group of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> who are attacked while copulating, and we have to see the genitals of the freaks of long thin hair. Meanwhile, there is a guy who looks like a demoniac Leslie Neilson who shouts "You do not have the authority to declare a happy birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this parade of disgust is completed by the classic "Pod People" of MST3K, whose face explodes after eating a salad of slug-laces (another fate easily avoided guilty of the useful and harmless slugs). <br /> <br /> Human beings are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic and, in a scene without meaning, as possible violators. In the climactic scene of the film, human villains try to burn the slugs that shrink impotently in the sewers. Well, since they are idiots, humans succeed in BLOWING THE TOTIRE TOWN. They alone do more damage than slugs! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans, and I know that you do, you will appreciate "Slugs". If you are a fan of bad movies, you will also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There is enough bad acting, silly dialogue, illogical turns in the plot, boring special effects, meaningless scenes and poor dubbing to get your attention.
