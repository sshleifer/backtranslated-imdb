The box for "To Die For" caught me, a man without a shirt and the promise of some laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is kind to the eyes, but without laughter and little sensuality. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, have allegedly been together for several years, but none of the characters is interesting enough to worry about, so it's hard to imagine them worrying about each other. The flaw seems to be in the script, not in the performances; Both actors do the best they can with what they are given. <br /> <br /> The ending is boring and does not affect (well, not at all unaffected, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about gay and AIDS relationships that is fun, "Goodbye looks" is much better.
