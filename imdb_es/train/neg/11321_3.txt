You can not go very far when the initial story is not so good. The premise that the blood the cyborg needs is stupid. <br /> <br /> The script is a blas√© '. The actors do not have much to work with. The games were organized in the desert to reduce costs. It is a registered trademark that if the background is desert, then the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> The lack of budget is fine, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent $ no work. but this movie seems like they have to put their changes together just to buy a sandwich for the cameraman. Again, forgivable, if only the story does not simply stink. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the greatest crime of all: It does not end! It just ends up as if it were a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. I just miss <br /> <br /> Simply bad.
