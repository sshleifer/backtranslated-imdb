This annoying and laborious Las Vegas casino robbery is almost impossible to see and involve. It's something you "look at" if you have nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this movie are related to the beautiful Stella Stevens and one goes through the entire program with the hope that she will fall off one of those tiny clothes she wears. Many great photos of Las Vegas in the mid-70s (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashions of the day are also good for a giggle. Otherwise, a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transfer, but even less than $ 10 is still not worth it in my humble opinion.
