So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10, but in reality this does not deserve more than half of a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can not believe that any of the stars signed to make this project ridiculously absurd. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate was also so good, but the story was very bad and I encourage anyone to see this in the store videos to not even bother to pick it up and read the back cover, but to simply walk away ... I do not even want to go into what the film is about, because it is too stupid to be pontificate. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It is awful! Horrible!
