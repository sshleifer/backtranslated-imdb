Letting the class see this in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it seems that this had no effect on the class, as long as the teacher left, conversations started quickly, and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" being used at all. And when you look at this, it's easy to see why. The performance is nothing special: everyone seems bored, they only read the page without worrying about the world. Shakespeare always preferred the exhibition dialogue to action and death, but I simply could not understand a word that everyone was saying. The costumes are not as bad as neither are the special effects: it is possible that the class did not like the movie, but they were not taking the p * ss exactly either. But it's hard to joke with a movie that lacks inspiration or joy. The scenes on the boat at the beginning of the film were not badly done, although the rain seemed a bit unreal, everything else was fine and well done. But where were the severed heads and the masts of explosion? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have taken it much more seriously if he had been wearing clothes, but since everything was on display, it was just another excuse for a joke. This movie is in no way attractive to either sex. Women and girls will not have any romance or comedy to enjoy, and there are a lot of naked men and lack of action or death that will alienate most men and boys. The Tempest was not badly made, but it felt like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And general boredom and lack of inspiration prove it. 3/10
