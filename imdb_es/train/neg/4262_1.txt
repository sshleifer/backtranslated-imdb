In short, the worst movie I've seen. Its range is more than 2 hours, and the art of the box was totally deceptive. My friends and I rented it because, we thought it would be 300 of a poor man. You know, laugh and mock. No. There's nothing funny in this movie, just pain. Then, the movie starts, and they are speaking a different language. We think: 'Oh, it's just the beginning.' But no, from there the film collapses and becomes more like a super boring book that you had to read in elementary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 children who struggle in a playground. Skip the cinematography, and this movie belongs to the trash compactor. Films like this will take the world we see on Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
