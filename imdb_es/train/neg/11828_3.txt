A few months ago, I participated in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it. Based partially on that argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least on the part of Aardman), but lacks the strength to unite everything. His best asset is the sewer rat / ship captain, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the main character in the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends much of her screen time whimpering. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to begin with. with. When Roddy is hit in a squat, the film ensures that he is hit five times more immediately. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags involving pain is low at all times. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my time trying to understand Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies towards Pixar (a similar movie is a coincidence, five is a scam). But I'll say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and have done) much better. Try harder next time, guys.
