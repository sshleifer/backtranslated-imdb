R Balki tries to tell a story that Ram Gopal Verma had previously told in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time it mixes with mature moods. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still Hyderabadi Biryani can not do correctly. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu, who sends him the correct Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and soon they start to meet and finally fall in love? Amitabh is 65 years old and Tabu is 35 ?? No problem! But a pull! The father of Tabu, Paresh Rawal! The couples decide to meet with the father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger for him. And the complications begin? Performance wise the three actors are brilliant. The script of the movie is very tight and interesting. The dialogues of the film are catchy. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly full. Comedy is sometimes not well understood. The film also tries to prolong itself in some parts. <br /> <br /> Musically there's not much to sing about, except the title track. The camera work is good. The director R Balki could have given much better of this script. But in the second half he himself is confused. The father's "Satyagrah" scene seemed annoying. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are worthy of applause. <br /> <br /> In general, Cheeni Kum needed to have more sugar!
