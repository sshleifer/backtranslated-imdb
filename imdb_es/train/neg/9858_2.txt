This movie is not funny. Simply take the stereotypes of the D & D nerd and amplify them. All the main characters earn less than 30,000 a year, all live with their parents, all are socially retarded and have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, like two of the players who were hit by a black dwarf because one of them had a KKK hood (it was his magician costume) and the other had a John Rocker warm up (oh how fun, he's a nerd so he does not know about sports). You may have to be a high school kid to make this funny. Badly made mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to do. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties beyond their peak.
