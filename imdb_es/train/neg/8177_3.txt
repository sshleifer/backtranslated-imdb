90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a mockery for her boyfriend Bill ... Mindy makes fun of the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes Big Sur, steals a loaf of "shepherd's bread", Mindy is almost raped by a gang ... Ah, the pleasures of Crown International's drive-in features. You must remember that these movies were never designed to be seen from beginning to end on DVD players. They were made as 90 minutes of atmosphere for the teenagers of the 70s to have a soundtrack as they did in their Pintos and Appointments. The lack of pace and structure did not matter to the original audience: they probably only tuned in when the T & A on the screen matched what they were doing, in the parking lot. The movie is really irritating when it looks like a story. It's much more fun to talk about that than to see it. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or change of underwear, spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, as in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and almost raped by depraved motorcyclists, and after her innocent friend "Pan" is savagely beaten, Mindy and her girlfriend find a motorcycle without surveillance on the road. Mindy immediately lights up and emits a screech, "I'm going to Big Sur!" But, again, it is much more fun to talk / read than to sit down.
