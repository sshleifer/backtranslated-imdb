"Laughter is a state of mind," says the label, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What could you have been thinking during the manufacture of "Toys"? When he saw the rush, did he see a successful and fun fantasy? If so, then you are working on a different plane than I am. This is an unbearable image, in which the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the colors of cartoons are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (most especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brothers of a toy mogul, who are overlooked as heirs of the factory when his father dies. There is nothing remotely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on the screen here. It is uniformly draggy, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS OF ****
