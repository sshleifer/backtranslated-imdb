I saw this movie with low expectations and I was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's really funny in a very dignified way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean he just can not act, period. He should give up now, since acting clearly is not his thing. Their castmates have the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous ... Somehow, I do not think there's an Oscar in the cards for this guy. <br /> <br /> I have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do so. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do not do 0/10 if there was a 0
