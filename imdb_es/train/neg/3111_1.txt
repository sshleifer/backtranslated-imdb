I would have rated this movie with a value of minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why did not I come out in the first five minutes of this movie that I can not say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately! Several people in our theater did it and, unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story lacked all the criteria for a movie. DO NOT parcel. Horrible performance! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that he may never see another movie he is in. Not a single relationship in the story went beyond the classroom conversations. I liked the tazer scene. Too bad it did not impact the flesh a little in the folly of the plot. Someone has to tazer the writer and director of this movie!
