I gave 'Kôhî jikô' a low score not because it was a bad movie, but because it does not do anything worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before, but for the uninitiated (including myself) 'Kôhî jikô' is announced as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was in 1962) The film is an extremely scarce work ... that contains very little dialogue, history, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> I Hitoto plays 'Yoko' an unemployed and wandering character who spends his time in his local coffee shop or who freely investigates a Taiwanese composer he likes. Tadanobu Asano plays her friend, who works in a CD store and occasionally pleases her interest in trains. And that's it. <br /> <br /> We see how Yoko drinks coffee alone ... walks around ... waits for a train ... takes a train ... falls asleep on the train. The kind of mundane reality that anyone in Japan can see on a daily basis. Hou captures these ordinary moments of the life of these characters, but without any meaning for these vignettes is a totally useless movie to do or look at.
