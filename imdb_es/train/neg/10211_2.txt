Except for recognizing a good photograph, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the protagonist's dilemma if you stay with your childhood friends in the world of misery or leave them and take your own life. The abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot and, due to the bad performance, they also fail to create the desired atmosphere. The director only manages to present Anthony's dilemma and finally brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to talk about any character ... perhaps except for Sonny. Next to him, the actors do not play much and when some of them have to do it, they become self-satisfied fans. I wonder what ruined the film the most: the superficial script, discarding all the potential of the plot, or the bad performance, disturbing any resource that might remain.
