I saw this movie when I was very small. It is, by far, one of the strangest movies I've seen. Now, normally, I like rare movies, but this was a bit too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in the movie. In any case, it begins as Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, the madness emerges. There are the Greedy, the Looneys, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a group of pirates who sing show tunes, all of which makes the movie more bizarre. Also, I can not help but feel that Babette is annoying and a little too whiny. She definitely did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, even though I did not like this movie, there were some nice parts. I liked the song of the camel. Even though it was a song about being alone, I had a friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were simple madmen, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the most fun. King Koo Koo was just a small bag of garbage that made Dr. Evil look like a serious villain. Also, there was Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for young children who wanted to act hard. But, honestly, even these things did not improve the movie. (But remember, this is just my perspective). <br /> <br /> Although I personally would not recommend this movie, I must even admit that it has its lovely moments. Look at it if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
