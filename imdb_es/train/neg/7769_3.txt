A real head scratch from a movie by Bill Rebane, which seemed to worsen his trade throughout the eighties. Three crazy millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a permanent contest in which the final contestant will receive $ 1 million, as long as it reaches that far. Some of the guests are thrown a series of jokes while others get involved in what most adults would do under those circumstances, especially in the hotel bar. Most scenes are simply an excuse to focus the camera on various parts of the female body, including an opening dance number that is a cross between American Bandstand and geriatric aerobics complete with prostitutes. If there was any doubt that white people can not dance, this scene hammers the last nail into that coffin. Pay close attention to the nipple sliding. This continues for about forty-five minutes, until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts in several turns of the plot and whatever it hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene, which makes this an incoherent mess. It is a game until it is not a game. The three old sucks are in complete control until they are not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it only becomes props. They are dead until they are not. Even the narrator finally responds that he does not know what the hell happened. I challenge anyone to reason where Rebane went in this case. The performance is dinner theater caliber minus dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at Stuckey's place. I give you some points for the scene in which the wide yuppie opens the closet and there is a skeleton inside the skull that moves. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that! This collection of Chilling Classics is really becoming a nightmare for me. Bane, get it! As Rebane! I hate myself.
