When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, starring the two twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating shoddy movies but shoddy movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is a remarkably trashy action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fails on all levels. The appearance of the film is all wrong. Some scenes were well recorded, but the tone and the "disco" style of the clothes and hair with which they are decorated do not make any sense, even for a low budget movie like this one. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an older woman with that ridiculous hair and suit. He is supposed to be threatening, but he presents himself as a buffoon. And it's fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first film, walking in a skimpy bikini. I'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are fine as the muscular heroes, but it is almost impossible to build an adequate critique of their performance because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, very poorly conceived. The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his butt, while the other twin's loincloth just covers his muscular butt. I'm not kidding! However, do not ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to accept making this movie. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this film of poor quality. It's just bad
