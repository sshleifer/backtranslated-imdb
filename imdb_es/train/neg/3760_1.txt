This is the biggest piece of lame I've seen in my life. It is terribly boring, I would have preferred to attend a seminar on creationism than to have seen it if I had known it was going to be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot girl in bikini with the big ta is redeems this from nothing lower than a 1. <br /> <br /> The critics of this movie who claim that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and simply EVIL. Nothing funny about this movie. They spend the first 50 minutes or so walking through the woods talking about things you would not understand or care about, and it's just as perverse when people start to die because you do not even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting. . Honestly, I did not see it until the end, but that should say something about how horrible it is. The worst movie of my life. <br /> <br /> Immediately after expelling this garbage from my DVD player, I started scraping it against the cement that was in front of my house, without wanting other successful clients to fall into the same mistake that was As for renting this movie. Then Zach urinated on his pants. Thanks for your time.
