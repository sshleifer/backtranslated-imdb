A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues with the scientific research of his late father on the regeneration of the extremities with great success, but his dominant mother and her loving lover of medicine want to sell the serum. When he finds out, there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm. Then, he tests the serum and what happens is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen this oh so many times before, but what gets this up is very campy and Shonky's junk, pretty gummy, is the performance of the movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. It's not really a bad movie from Fangoria's movies; There are only better ones, which are similar in vein. "Server loops" simply lacks its own distinctive style. The strange nature and the nasty splash looked like "Re-animator" and even a touch of slapstick jutted out like something from "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The history of the comic is really hit with its black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises arise, especially the final result of the film. Which is well accepted, since I thought I could have solved something more accessible. For a low budget production, the FX makeup may seem stiff and very silly, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile instead of tremble. Even a touch of sexual tension simplifies the story, thanks to the sternly juicy performance of Elke Sommer as the mother. Oliver Reed is, with much humor, a deadpan expression in a perverse sense and he achieves it extremely well. Both deviated immensely as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is charming in an erratic performance like Harry. The director Damon Santostefano strides energetically through the film and organizes some elegant scenes of passionate horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's silly, youthful and basically silly, but you have to give it to little demanding entertainment.
