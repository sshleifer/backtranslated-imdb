I love corny horror movies. I do not care if the performance is insufficient or if the monsters seem corny. I liked this movie, except for the disconcerting feeling from the beginning to the end. Look, I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a big-lettered letter that tells me an argument. But Dark Floors takes the "what's this movie about?" thing to a completely new level (annoying). What is this movie about? <br /> <br /> This is not exceptionally scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent the winner.
