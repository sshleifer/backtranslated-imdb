Terrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has an IQ of stupid monkey. What a mess. I just could not believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are very strange and are out of the question, the camera sometimes works. Just horrible, the music sometimes like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I only saw this movie to see how much worse it can be put. Some of the "actors" side kicks are a total disaster. I'm sorry, but all my thumbs and toes and anything. That it can hang down on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows, he may be in a difficult financial situation to participate in a fiasco movie. . . . . This film should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson on how not to make a film.
