I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most favorable factor for owning the DVD is the short video in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Do not get me wrong, I'm a horror girl. But I want some meat behind the story, not to mention that I prefer evil to happen to humans, not cheat me to see, what seemed like an eternity, animal clips. The acts of brutality interrupt the prolonged silence and the bad performance. If they forced me to make a comparison with another movie, the only one that comes to my mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, meaningless and a totally uncomfortable watch.
