This movie is very similar to the movie Hostel, except with the performance of * BAD * and not much suspense. The blood elements are there, but you really do not feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence not very effective. Some parts are simply strange ... like forcing a snake down someone's throat. What's up with that? Is that supposed to be scary or bloody? It is a bit stupid. As for torture, there really is not any (except for the guy who gets a blowtorch at the beginning, which does not show anyway). The main villain keeps saying "make them die slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes, I saw the "unrated" version. So, in general, it's not the worst bloody film I've seen, but it's not quite right either. You will not miss anything if you skip this one.
