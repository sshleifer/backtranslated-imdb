I realize that several Ben Stiller films are on sale or will be released this year, but perhaps I should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was shocked at what the filmmakers thought happened to comedy in "Along Came Polly." <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is unbearable, unlovely and stands as a of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick is getting heavy. Undoubtedly, he has talent for comics, but he needs to find another program or take a break, find some material that is really fun. Because his films go from painful to unbearable. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good intelligent actress with a promising career. While she continues making more films like "The Good Girl" (in which she is great) and less like "Along Came Polly", she will have a career that she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston desperately tries to overcome the limp material he is working with, but it is a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Stan, Reuben's boss, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Sandy, Reuben's best friend, there's nothing funny about this horrible movie. Other supporting characters, such as Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. The accent of Azaria is not only stupid, it is terribly without grace. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" certainly proved promising. Unfortunately, I needed a writer who could really turn it into a good comedy, instead of this boring, boring and boring excuse for a comedy.
