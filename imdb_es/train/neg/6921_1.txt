I went to a pre-selection of this movie and I was surprised at how corny it was. It was a combination of all the horror / suspense clich√©s, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion ... and it was a disaster. The performance was quite wash table; the boy and the guy Jesus were fine, but apart from them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (although it failed a little) in trying to show Christians in a different way ... even though they did, the way the gospel was presented was a bit clumsy and childish. But, again, it may have to be that way, since he was talking to a small child ... no. Actually, I have decided that everything is bad. music ... oh, my God ... horrible ... too much, too dramatic. Good. I felt bad for the people who made this film at the premiere; It seemed like a poor student project. I'm going to stop talking about this now and say the final result, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life in the trash. there you go
