After watching the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil get her punishment for torturing animals just for her skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and in my opinion, better than the animated one. But in reality there was no need for a second. First of all, if Cruela is coming back, do not heal her and go crazy again. Just make her escape from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It is assumed that he has only one original puppy that returns. I expected it to be Lucky, since it was the most attractive, and also, also with Roger and Anita. However, they decided to make a complete recast and add not really a hundred, not even a hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks it is a dog (ready). The part of Gerard Depardieu was useless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect as the first one. That just did not work. It was too exaggerated, and not too much fun. Actually I felt bad for Cruella.
