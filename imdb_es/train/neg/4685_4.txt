Until the last minutes of the movie, I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. . The Captain, Gene Hackman, is ready for the launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of first confirming the launch orders. The problem is that, to launch BOTH, the captain and the 1st officer must use their launch keys simultaneously. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until this finally results in armed insurrection aboard the submarine. Finally, the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool However, here comes the part that simply does not sound true. After they return to Earth and appear before a review board, Washington and Hackman (who have just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and they are all friends! Eh A too trite ending to make the movie worthwhile for me.
