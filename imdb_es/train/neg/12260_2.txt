Sometimes, I relax my head and think about the reasons why movies about murderous sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made these days. These coquitas have been making copies of "Jaws" since the 70s, not that they are becoming more popular. The idea remains exactly the same. Then we have an animal that begins to kill people. First he knocks down some minor characters, then starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies, except for someone who used to be a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal in some way, usually with a bang. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you count the fact that the "specialist" is a captain in this unique variation, in that case his standards are quite low. However, it's funny that Duncan Regehr played it, he used to be Zorro. Hell, I'll give you an extra point for that.
