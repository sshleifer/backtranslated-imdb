In this small forgetfulness, Norma Shearer, 40 years old, plays a sociable young girl in Monte Carlo, caught in a fight between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the boring and talented script or director George Cukor for the failure of this film, who never seems interested in animating the generally comatose state of the film. For the most part, however, it is the fault of Shearer, who desperately wanted to continue playing "young" parts as long as he could get away with it. Inadvertently, this makes "Your cardboard lover" a strange monument to the vanity of an old woman.
