Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity, but I saw it for the first time last night and it was easily introduced in my last five of all time. Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies? This movie was so bad that, after I finished mercifully, all I could do was laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Fortunately, I am too anal to deactivate a movie without seeing all this or I could not boast of seeing it all at once! I like to think that you can say something positive about anything in life, so, according to that theory, I will recognize the most positive asset of this film, it was very brief for a long-running movie.
