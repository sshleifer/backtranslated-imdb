It was almost incomprehensible to me that this movie was a failure, but I was disappointed. After having been a connoisseur of Pekinpah cinema for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and I thought it was worth trying. The first credits, iconic for fans of Pekinpah, have the interrelationship between man and animal, but here we have the non-diegetic environmental noise of children playing in the playground of a school while a bomb is being placed. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the criminals, Caan and Duval, travel to their next mission, Duval drops the bomb on Cann because his appointment the night before had an STD, which could only be found in his bag while Cann had intimate relations with her. The resulting laughter is fantastic, and a tribute is paid to Dressed to Kill, by Brian Depalma, at the expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the movie does not work. Even Bring Me The Head by Alfredo Garcia has a stronger production value, a bold appeal for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use the Pekinpah credits as supplementary reading material, but once they are finished, deactivate The Killer Elite.
