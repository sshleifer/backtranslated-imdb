Although, unfortunately, it is thought to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this film is very merciful quickly. The script does not make much sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of a movie, why he should never have left the music. Its performance is one-note and irritating. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that can be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to take a good turn. His last bad lieutenant would show how bad the good actors can act, but fortunately his performance here is moderate.
