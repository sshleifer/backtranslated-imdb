This is a scam of the old Frankenstein premise. An acclaimed scientist dies in a strange accident and his father, a leading brain surgeon, saves the brain. Then he puts on a robotic body of his own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the impetus to the "colossus" so that the thoughts move. The whole project goes wrong, when the creation goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is missing And it's funny that this does not scare a little. Well, very young children will think that this is good. If you're awake at three in the morning and this goes on ... night, night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the 'Colossus'.
