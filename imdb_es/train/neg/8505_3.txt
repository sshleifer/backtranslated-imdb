"Holy Week" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows at people. Mira has an Italian accent that falters from time to time. Could not she just speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican / English accent that distracts. The dialogue is very bad and its delivery is made of wood. The cinematography looks good, but that's not enough to save this gut. THIS FOLLOWING PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> During the climax it seems that the villain is going to escape, but then goes back down the stairs to be shot and do a cool trick on the railing. That only shows that this script has no originality. AVOID!
