The only reason I did not get this rating is because Sibrel shows that he is an expert in the technical aspects of making a film. It is a technically expert film. <br /> <br /> That said, it is a film based on lies and distortions that are easily refuted. Most of the documentary is used using propaganda techniques to hit the space program, instead of actually doing it. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that the landings were falsified is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend seeing this, but if you do, watch it for free on google video. Do not let Bart Sibrel benefit from your curiosity.
