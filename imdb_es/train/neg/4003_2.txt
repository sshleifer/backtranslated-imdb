A big disappointment. This was one of the best detective / police drama shows in the United Kingdom in the 90s that developed the fascinating title character played by the Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this has little to add and may suffer an inevitable disappointment due to high expectations when a favorite program returns after a long pause. Coltrane really does not have much to do, he gives much more attention to the murderer who is not interesting and, in what he has to do, seems not involved, almost boring. The story of the former soldier is written in the books and the attempt to update ourselves on Coltrane's family life seems light. Maybe if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of this one two-hour program, they would have written this in much more depth. As it is, skip this and see the old Cracker of the 90s, which is far superior.
