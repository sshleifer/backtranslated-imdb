Although the cast of this film was admirable, particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so bad that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make it worthwhile to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we saw the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to refuse it. It may have been that we "expected" the message to become apparent and that we could extract some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience may have been able to "make sense" of this complicated story, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. However, the writers did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need that we seem to have to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was evident that those involved were simply going through the movements of their respective trades, and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was secondary or nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, movies made for television seem to have evolved over the years. While communicating a message to the audience may have been the main interest of writers in the past, current writers and producers seem to be condescending with their audience, focusing primarily on manipulating us to "stay tuned" through the relentless publicity that seems to be the only reason why movies like Surrender, Dorothy, are made.
