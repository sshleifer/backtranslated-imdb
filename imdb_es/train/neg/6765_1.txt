* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critique of media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious and inhuman murderers of innocent people, and contrasted this with a morbid fascination with the media. Instead, it gives them justification. The film portrays almost all the victims as someone who deserved to be hurt. Stone devotes himself to vicious stereotypes, and presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures: imbecile peasants, English-speaking immigrants, fat lazy people. The only person that homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they make friends with the old American Indians who use hallucinogens, why are they fashionable, dude? Let's make it an admirable character. Fat, Chinese employees and "hicks" are not great, so let's make it look like they deserve to die. Instead of twisted, hateful people who are corrupted by their crimes, their uproar makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy, and surreal visuals are meant to attract more impressionable people. Justice mocks. Police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and frowning compared to the GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the "reality" of the film. There are no nuances or subtleties in the film, only exaggerated presentations and visual effects. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in the real reactions of the real world. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for the murders they committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The intelligent message is not in view.
