The plot of this movie is not strong, many holes. If you consider it as a car movie, it's not bad, there are many great cars in it. The reason why I like it is because I'm from the area where this was filmed. I really enjoy seeing the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the city has changed since 89. It is an interesting historical piece for locals. It seems that every time a movie is made here, everyone wants to have some relationship with it. It is impossible to find a copy at any of the local video stores, as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on Ebay. I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is found throughout the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
