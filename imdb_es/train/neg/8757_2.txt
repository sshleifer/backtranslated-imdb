Apparently a movie that predicts the next trends in British popular music is wrong on so many fronts that it is ridiculous. Tommy quickly? Diapers? The movie DOES include a song by the Spencer Davis group, two of the Animals and a taped live Beatles movie making their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But in general, an uncomfortable sample of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
