This movie was horrible. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no argument for the movie at all. The only decent thing about the movie was the performance of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. His performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not do justice to their performances. If the script had been close to capturing a half decent story, it would be worth seeing. In contrast, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted on a terrible God story ... or the lack of it. Not only I kept waiting for the whole movie to happen something to make the movie ... well, a real movie ... not just the dialogue between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than a common dialogue that would have taken place in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall portrayed an old man, senile and drunk. Nothing worthy happens throughout the film, including the ending. When the movie ended, I was amazed ... surprised to have been sitting throughout the movie waiting for something of interest to happen so that it was worth watching the movie. Never happened! The cast of characters suddenly began to roll, which made it clear that the movie was really over and I realized that I had lost two hours of my life watching a movie without any plot or meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie takes place in a day of time. That's. It was a day in the life (and death) of some southerners in a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (apart from the movie Training Day)? The performances of the entire cast were excellent, but they were wasted enormously in a disappointment of a movie ... if it can be called a movie.
