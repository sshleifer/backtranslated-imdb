I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly made and the performance was terrible. The main problem I had with the movie was the second half with Nichole Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events that surrounded that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father suffered psychological distress at that time and picked up Nichole without any intention of harming her. He loved her like a daughter and was convinced that he was rescuing her from some kind of damage or neglect that he probably believed came from his mother, who paid little attention to her for more than 3 years that my father cared for her and raised her summarily so that his mother could have fun. The movie showed my father in a way that was going to hurt him in some way. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my parents' house while Sharon worked or did whatever he was doing. The reason why my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be thought of as weapons in his truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they considered weapons were gardening tools that he had in his truck all the time to work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, it's a good story and it's based on real events. However, the details of the film (at least the part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and describe the failure of the director. Discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have said exactly what I posted here.
