This program is possibly the biggest, ugliest and most generic steam stack I've seen in children's programming that has really succeeded. The main character, Johnny, although I understand that he is supposed to represent a normal child, is not pleasant or even tolerable. The jokes are boring, exaggerated (that is, the joke "Whoa, I did not see what was coming." Come on, that was not even funny the first time, it's not even cute) and lacks any form of primitive ingenuity or inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at. Although children are not especially critical of artistic talent, they still prefer sweets. I can not stand to see the show, because somehow, the artistic style is just ... disgusting. Horrible, in fact. Simply smelly. <br /> <br /> I just can not bear that this is getting so much airtime. While I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and should not make me look forward to returning ... I really miss the old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's lab, the super-power girls ... anything but this shit. Although I guess it's just an illusion. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I advise you not to waste your time in this show. I think that big kids can also enjoy really good cartoons. And this does not cut it.
