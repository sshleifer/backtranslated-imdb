My wife and I watch a movie every night without distractions, and mostly artistic films that require reflection. I have a lot of patience for the films that take time to blossom. My wife has double the attention span that I have. All that is said, this movie is simply empty and boring! He did not go anywhere. It never bloomed. It started quite strong with a promising plot ... then she makes cookies ... goes to Spain ... gets angry, stares ... the list of credits. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We did FF through several extended sequences of it, just looking into space. The artificial depth was implicit when she played with the clay and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully filmed movie for girls that pretends to be profound or artistic. You never get to know or understand Morvern. About half of you just do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines developed. Do not waste your time on this. I'm surprised that the scores are so high.
