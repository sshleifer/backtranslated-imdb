To be honest, this movie is another in a series of huge disappointments ... most of these films called "horror masters" are only horrifying in terms of their low quality effects and their smiling stories ... apart from Ron Perlman , everyone else in this movie can not act to save his life ... the shots sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the microphone boom or something, and it seemed completely unreal ... in general, this movie is so Scary as the Home Solo ... the only good teachers are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the same genre that some of them used to understand. ..
