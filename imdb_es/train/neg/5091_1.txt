['My comment is for the Russian version of the Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) that is shown on the first Russian channel from April 10 to 13, 2006. A bad translation could have ruined some details, but I doubt so be it The number of errors in fact is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first missiles). Even the American half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. The audience is not informed of any V-2 / A-4 releases from the US UU Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same &#39;EU&#39; serial number on board. Apollo 1 will be launched to the Moon, etc. On the Russian half, each person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, etc. Men as functions; Without motivation, without life. The uniform and the decorations are horrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting release (I think this was added especially for the Russian version).']
