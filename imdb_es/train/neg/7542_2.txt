This movie is supposed to be a mysterious and serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, within 30 minutes of the movie, it becomes a funny and unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine someone who does not laugh when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blond girl or when she "bears" that old woman. Lines, characters and acting are wrong from the start. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he's done some terrible movies this year; this is, by far, the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a thriller that tells stories. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. However, if you want to see it, be prepared to laugh at some of the lines and finish the scenes instead of taking them seriously; That's the only way you enjoy this movie.
