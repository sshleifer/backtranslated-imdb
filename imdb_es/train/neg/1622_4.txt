The only reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS series was broadcast. The trailers put a lot of emphasis on the main character had a mutilated arm that made me expect him to be like Victor Caroon of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT that lurked the streets of London. <br /> <br /> There was not so much luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather monotonous thriller with the trick of having a physically disabled hero trying to get to the bottom of the investigations of corrupt horse racing. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you could enjoy it, but put it in the context of the late 70's, when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced, there is something missing in THE RACING GAME. A trailer showed a car that took another in a motor way, if it had been a trailer of THE SWEENEY, you would see Jack Regan taking a car and beating a confession of the scum that had done a great job while the professionals I would have taken a car and scared away the terrorists. I think that sums up what is wrong with this series.
