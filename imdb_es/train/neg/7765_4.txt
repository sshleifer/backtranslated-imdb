Strange, almost all critics are very positive with this movie. Is it because it is 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and, therefore, forgive bad performances and childish ways of telling stories? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people feel sentimental about this movie because they've read the book? (I have not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, the filmmakers never presume that the viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I am unconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors are trying to behave like their French counterparts?
