Television influences society ... just look at the increase in the popularity of cappuccino stores after this small superficial work debuted. Also, real people who look as good as these people do not have any problems. <br /> <br /> Also, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a beautiful Manhattan loft considering what they do for a life? NBC loves to insult the intelligence of the viewer, even if they are close to the Gump level. I know someone who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 a month to rent. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a program called Phriends, where there are six ugly fools in dead ends, living in an unpleasant neighborhood where sirens howl constantly and someone is assaulted every week ... and then the landlord elevates the rent. Now that I would like to see.
