Oh my God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not watch this movie! In the 82 minutes of my life I will never go back. Sure, I could have stopped looking in the middle. But I thought I could improve. He did not. Anyone who has really enjoyed this movie is a seriously ill and twisted individual. It's no wonder that Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from acting to editing. Normally I do not even write comments here, but in this case I'll make an exception. I wish someone had warned me before hiring this catastrophe
