The first time I saw Cold Case was after it was published for about a year on Danish television. By the time he reached television, he almost drowned in another 4 or 5 US crime shows that aired at about the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I got bored to death. The actors of inferior quality with just faces and morals were a pain in the back. The complete premise that so much money was given to a team of investigators to solve murders that date from 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor, since they only have 50 -60 minutes to tell the story, which means that they get a break just at the right time to solve the case and bring justice to the surviving relatives, if they are still alive. This, combined with the problems and the "personal" relationships of the researchers for whom the moment must have come, leaves the show completely ground-out. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2-star rating because of the music I have at the end. that's really the only reason to see it ... which, of course, you will not do, since it's TOO MUCH a reason to see this shit.
