I can not believe that blockbuster takes this movie. It was so bad I was totally deceived by the art picture. DO NOT BE FOOLED! It's not worth your time I promise. I do not know if the positive reviews of this movie were a joke or what. I'm very disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not even match! The girl who has the voodoo done is a stripper, the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 years old. people who write the description for the movie bother to see it! Those positive reviews had to be a joke, they just had to be.If someone really liked this movie, I lost all faith in humanity. <br /> <br / > And I do not even mean the story compared to the title, or the fact that the whole movie was done in 2 locations, or that the police did not even have real uniforms, why would they do it? Who cares about police uniforms? "Compared to the rest of the film, the uniforms were successful. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and to all its fans.
