This was disappointing. He started well enough, but as he progressed and lost all opportunities to rise, he fell. The performance of Maria Schrader is terrible, she never seems to mean what she says, or even to know what she says until she says it. He showed no genuine emotion at all, neither for his beloved goy, nor for the story of his mother. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. It seemed that there was never a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallelism between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was clich√©, and in any case she failed miserably. The wedding was totally unconvincing and a mute ending. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena did or did not do to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown some complexity of feelings at that moment, an obsessive look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had depth or spark. It was very difficult to worry about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did he dissuade him so much when he phoned from the hotel? There was no context or explanation for that). If all references to it were deleted, it was not noticeable. <br /> <br /> A simple story that is confused with poor character development (who was whose mother, again?) weak acting, and a direction that made everyone seem to be acting. You could almost hear "calm on the set! ...". I began to think that it was worthy of a 7, but as the film progressed it was quickly reduced to a 4, and then gained a 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. This was a film as cold and sterile as the one I've seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
