I had the (bad) fortune to see this movie in an exhibition in the United States. Having sat reluctantly through everything abysmal, I am surprised to have seen so many good reviews here at IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fit in the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this movie just sucks ......., well, nothing really. It is so bad <br /> <br /> Imagine a badly made perfumes commercial, do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna could never act, and has been a disgrace on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with each of those years, becoming more and more like a skinny meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" in Lock Stock, could never direct either, his films are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He does not disappoint here either; He wisely chose his wife as the star of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please, people, pay little attention to the good reviews that this movie has received from other posters below. Obviously, they are commercial plants. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humble himself more by giving him money. <br /> <br />
