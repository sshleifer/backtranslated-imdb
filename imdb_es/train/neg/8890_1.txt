For my first contact with Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did to a perfectly good work. <br /> <br /> - Let's start with the good, okay? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although part of their dialogue could have been produced with more feelings. The rest of the actors needed to put it together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are you still not dead, Romeo? The actor, although not only completely wooden and dead, could not read his sentences with pleasure. He was completely out of focus, he had difficulty even to look Juliet in the face, and absolutely NO grace with the lines he was given. Whoever throws it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but does not give depth to her character, and seems to be completely out of touch with the work. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of place for the entirety of his dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and merciless with his lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this production half Romeo and Juliet. The acting was forced and the disguises were nothing less than a distraction. I have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort. I just wish I could give this movie a grade of zero.
