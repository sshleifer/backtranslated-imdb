I thought that this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only correct thing about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the fight scenes were very cheesy and false. Many of the actors and actresses were not very big. Some of the jokes that were supposed to be "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst possible rating it could get. Disney really has to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to lose a little time.
