I do not see this movie. Bad acting and stupid gore effects. A complete waste of time. I expected to see many cool murders and hot girls, instead, the director relied on animal killing videos to surprise him, the observer. Disgusting. The murders are pretty boring, basically stranglers. One woman puts worms in her mouth, another puts raw burgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, the new "killer" Burger King sandwich .... ha ha. I do not think this movie was based too much on real events. I mean, the real BTK killer did not carry a lot of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh yes ... a sacrificed cow's head too. Go figure.
