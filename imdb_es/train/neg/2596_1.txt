Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to "begin" ... then I waited for her to redeem herself ... and when she did not, I sat there, dumbfounded: 1) it could possibly be so bad, and 2) that I had just lose a couple of hours out of sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew could not have made such a bad movie ... and if I ever lost my faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the film was badly written, badly acted and ill-conceived. I can not believe that such a bad script was funded! He had a million opportunities to do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this film to qualify for!) And YET was not going anywhere! It is simply regrettable! Where the other critic had the idea that it was not the worst, it baffles me! Because believe me, if it got worse, I would have cut my wrists before I finished it.
