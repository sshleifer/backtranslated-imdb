I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I am sorry for the actors, since the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, I'm not sure how they could eliminate the lines. I really doubt that any actor could have saved this movie no matter how good it was. The characters did not develop at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot that seemed to go nowhere. It really is a shame, since the premise of the film was good and with a better quality of production, direction and script could have been a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laughed out loud at the dubbing, which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.
