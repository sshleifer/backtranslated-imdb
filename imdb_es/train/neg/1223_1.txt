What a weekend. Two days ago I saw the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While I was away". I'm trying to come to a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my mind as I watched. I guess "while she was away" was worse. <br /> <br /> Everything has been said before in other comments: unrealistic, illogical, etc. - The only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started to feel more for the evil men than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin prize if she really died (only the first half saw her, so I do not know ). Soon I was in two Darwin awards (if that is possible) for its immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she not only knew the script, but she was also responsible for bringing this loss of money to us, to the people? I believe that humans who waste a considerable amount of money are evil because the money could have been used to feed and clothe many people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it at the movies and at 20 percent who are Idiots, a good idea. opportunity to show how idiotic they are.
