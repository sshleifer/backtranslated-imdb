Even though the plot was very well detailed, and the story line was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals' voice doubled with someone else's for most of the movie was distressing since he was not sure who was he talking about? There were many parts in which he began to speak with his deep husky voice and then, then, the voice of someone else was speaking for him. I do not know the reason, however, if he had difficulties with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could have re-shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When one pays for a film, either in the cinema or on DVD, this film was not worth the price of admission that was charged. I have been a longtime follower of Steven Seagal and all of his films he has done in recent years. To date, I think this is one of the worst we've seen so far.
