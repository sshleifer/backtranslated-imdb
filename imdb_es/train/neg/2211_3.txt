LOL !!!!!! Funny, that sums up this movie in one word. What the fuck was this "thing", since it could kill me by using the word movie? !!!! I hope the director, writer and producer did not want this to go well, because he did not. A scientist turned his son into a hammerhead shark, and the shark killed a group of people that the scientist invited to the island. ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I hate this movie so much, that when I was watching it, it was so bad. I laughed at all the serious parts, because they were so cheesy and unprofessional ... and they could not have made the shark seem more unrealistic although this "thing" had a budget a little bigger than most low budget movies. All I have to say is that I see this movie hoping to laugh at all the bad acting and the stupid cheesy dialogue, because if you're waiting for a good movie, I'll be very disappointed.
