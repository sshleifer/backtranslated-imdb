Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting and the main character was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I saw him again a few days ago. It was horrible. Really. I do not know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing even a little entertaining. It was just silly. The story was weak. The performance was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but still the acting is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the fact that this film is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in the movies. However, I have seen people complain about the lack of black men in films like 'The Shaolin Temple' or the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever , you get the point. There are people seeing racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good ones. In fact, there is only one white man in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good ones are African-American. Do not get me wrong, I do not care if the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie like that I've seen. It just is not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, as in the case of 'The Street Fighter', there is no problem: in Japan, most people are Asian. But if there is only one white man in a US movie, there is some kind of problem: in the USA. UU., Most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with a totally white cast and only an Asian as a bad guy. It just is not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I had not had fun with that as a child.
