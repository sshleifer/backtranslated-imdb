For loyal fans of Duran Duran who want to see a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to be creative and make this 80s video something of a science fiction story, involving the villainous villain Barbarella from where the band got its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some of the great songs of the Duran Duran's 80's, confusing and annoying scenes are produced in which the fictitious antagonist is shown trying to stop the band in one of their concerts. Not only is good music interrupted repeatedly, but we also have to suffer through a cheap derivative story presented by an evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
