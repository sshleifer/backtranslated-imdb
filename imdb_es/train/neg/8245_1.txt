I can not believe that nobody liked this movie. I have seen many low-budget independent films, but this one was absolutely disastrous. The low budget does not mean that the movie has to be insane. Horror does not mean that the movie has to be insane. There was nothing scary in this movie at all. It was just a gore-fest, and one particularly disturbing in that. The performance was average, considering that they were all unknown actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to come out as "artistic", or something like that. This is not one of those really cool indie movies that cost only thousands of dollars, but they're incredibly well made. This was no more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on the movie. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack was bad ... that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the film. There were no redeeming qualities in this movie at all. A complete waste of my time and money.
