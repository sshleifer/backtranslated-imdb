I bought Unhinged because I was cheated by the bloody image on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, look at the back of the box. All deaths are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better on fixed frames than on the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's take a look at the plot. A group of college girls leading a rock concert (through dark, deep forests in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) glide off the road. No visible damage to the car, but apparently enough to put one of the characters in a coma for the rest of the movie (or maybe she read the script and was already in a coma before the filming began). <Br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large and isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and achieves more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. For some reason, however, this house has no roads to carry it. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged listening to odd conversations between a rich old bitch (who looks like George Washington) and her equally welcoming and sexually repressed daughter. Apparently, the girls were in no hurry to return from that concert, as they packed more clothes than the Gilligan's Island cast for that three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> At the moment that we, the spectators, arrive at the scenes of slaughter, we do not care anymore. We want someone to kill us just to end our suffering. Unhinged finally ends with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the end, the only good idea in the movie, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie before it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Unhinged is a boring movie with bad acting. Inept direction, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry, I'm not sure where that came from). You will get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes, while the characters do not talk about anything worth remembering. Do not waste your time. You will simply feel dissatisfied and want your time and your money back.
