This movie was terrible. At first, I just read the summary of the plot and it looked good, so I saw it. The performance was TERRIBLE. It was as if the actor was almost shy in front of the camera. Everything seemed false. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago ... I've seen it at least 20 times ... <br /> <br /> The plot was also crap. the writers probably had sleep problems when they created the lines. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it's the bad movie type. the one you keep seeing just to see how much worse it could be, so that you can then tell other people that you can not believe how terrible the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should see this. , so that later we could better appreciate other, TRUE, movies.
