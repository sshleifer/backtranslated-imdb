I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this really made you bored and disappointed u ........................... .. .......... <br /> <br /> This movie really does waste your time and money. I went with my friend to this film the first day of its premiere and both get bored in the movie theater .......................... .. .......................... <br /> <br /> The role of the CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT reduced the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character in the film is also It is not well defined as the previous one. This film shows the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confused ..... .......... ... <br /> <br /> A VERY BIG BIG REALIZATION
