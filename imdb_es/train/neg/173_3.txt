A decent sequel, but it does not pack the original's blow. A murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) assumes new identities to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. He's still ruthless to kill, but the movie seems very ironic. Any humor is not funny. The total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and, sometimes, Nelson is far above. This film is about a script that is rewritten before going to the screen ... this should have happened with this script.
