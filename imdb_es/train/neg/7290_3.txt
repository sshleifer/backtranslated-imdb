What a long, prolonged movie, meaningless. I'm sure that, historically, this movie is lovely, but as the entertainment goes away, it simply does not reach qualification. Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic movies, the English Patient, Schindler's List, but this was a disappointment. He did not seem to go anywhere, his character at first was so superficial and tense that I am surprised that his "sister" had ever been interested at all. Do not bother paying to rent this movie, buy a copy of the English patient instead.
