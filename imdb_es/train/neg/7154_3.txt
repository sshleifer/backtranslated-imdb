This movie has all the characteristics of too many cooks that spoil the stew. Based on the autobiography of Shielah Graham, it seems that the powers that can be set aside are not right. They could not decide if this was going to be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much they should soften the story of whoever it was. Therefore, a film that could have been a story about two fascinating personalities (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Mrs. Graham) becomes a disgusted and disconnected soap opera that tells us little about both. Added to this, there is absolutely no period sensation other than that of 1959. A clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in history or how much time passes. However, and this saved the movie, Kerr has never looked so beautiful, and Peck is always a very handsome man. They really are a beautiful and mature couple, and I just wish they had better material to work with. There is a scene that works: Scott chases Shielah while he is drunk, and seeing these two normally refined stars that hit each other is very disturbing and gives a fleeting idea of ​​what happens in a relationship like his. Apart from that, the film is a wasted opportunity and nowhere near the classic stature of other soaps produced by Wald in the 1950s (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).
