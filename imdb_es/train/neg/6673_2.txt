My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of garbage. The performance was made in the caliber of a production of sixth grade of Oklahoma and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script are four-letter words and innumerable variations in them. Mother F seems to be the favorite of the "writer" because it is constantly used. It must have taken all 10 minutes to write this script on some immersion in the last call. Thank God, I rented it and I was able to jump through most of the fast forward. Do not waste your time or money with this.
