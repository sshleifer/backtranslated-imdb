I really do not understand all the adulation that this movie has received. He is mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and avoids many of the big problems, that is, Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a Hollywood commercial movie is almost tolerable, but what about all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? Does it seem that the man crawls, grabs his briefcase and wears a dirty hat and somehow that seems to qualify as a good performance? Anyone who has met a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is little less than a caricature. It is also quite offensive. And, dare I say, right on the right side of being truly terrible
