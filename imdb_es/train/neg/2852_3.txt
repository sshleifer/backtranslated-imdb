This is a completely unpleasant movie, if it is done with dexterity. I tried it because it's starring Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot, a mafia boss who is about to leave a mental institution, sounded promising. The film is cataloged as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots (you should forgive the pun) of people with dimly lit interiors and elegant, if somewhat surreal, shooting each other: in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (There is no part of it apparently, anatomy is avoided while vague and cryptic dialogues are uttered, some of which are obviously supposed to be humorous in a postmodern way.) Goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a card 3x5, and uses a single facial expression, a sardonic smile, everywhere Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can Burt Reynolds makes a cameo The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but somehow I missed (good move on your part) Everything is cold, sterile, mechanical and unpleasant An heir, I suspect, in the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers' If you liked those, you probably will like this.
