I can not believe this is on DVD. Even less was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie if we consider that it only had a budget of $ 4000. I find this funny. I would find it very bad, whatever the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, I read the following in another review: "Apart from the dramatic, if you love the horror and love something like Duel (1971) updated with a little more history and some pretty girls released, You will love this movie. " <br /> <br /> What?!? It's a shame we compare those two movies. <br /> <br /> I give a "1", since I can not give a "0". I just do not see in any way this movie could be entertaining.
