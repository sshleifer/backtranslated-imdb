By now you should know about this movie, the "bomb" by Jessica Simpson that practically went directly to the video (limited and anemic theatrical edition). Basically, Ms. Simpson, Katie, travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She's stranded, but she has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I'd like to see more often in the movie), who lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job through two intricate co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and the always fun Andy Dick) who are only using Katie to get the president out of the firm (Larry Miller). This is strictly a b movie, it does not pretend to be deep. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress in any way, but she is quite beautiful and is never really annoying. The film can be seen in that it is not an abomination, but it is a disposable fuzz. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me laugh), and there is a funny scene with Norwegian priests (do not read much about this). Therefore, it is not horrible, but easy to jump. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does. Again, it's not good, but it's not a deep mess.
