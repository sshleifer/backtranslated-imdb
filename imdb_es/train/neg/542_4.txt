First, there is Gujarati theater, then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fanatical followers. Director Vipul Shah should look the other way instead of the Gujarati theater when he makes a Bollywood production. First he made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play), which had a unique plot, but which he could not hold as a Hindi film. Now he has adapted another work of Gujarati and called it Waqt, a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The development of the plot is not for Hindi films. For example, it is better to leave the role play between father and son in the Gujarati theater; Do not bring it in a Hindi movie. Even the comedy track is best left to the Gujarati stage. All the performances are normal, there's nothing to shout about, except Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is fantastic.
