Spoilers ahead: proceed at your own precaution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers, with relative ease, he continues to give in to his demands. And then, the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car to explode (with the money it contains), which makes us take a leap of logic quite high. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he wanted to keep his relationship with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement in the district attorney's campaign. I can see this, but why not hire someone to slap these bugs a bit, or even kill them once they determined that there was no real evidence of blackmail (for example, Cini's body?) This was a very interesting movie for the first two. / 3 of that. After that, it crumbles.
