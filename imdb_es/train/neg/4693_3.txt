This is exactly the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great potential story, then ruin everything with a script that goes nowhere ... and says nothing while going there! There is no depth here. No depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, suspense or common sense. We know what is happening, we are told how they plan to solve the problem, solve the problem, throw us a surprise near the end that does not generate suspense and then end the film abruptly. Wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Glenn Ford leads a group of actors from the UK (and one French) who are fantastic, doing an amazingly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they received. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", who gives some wonderful fragments of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film. I also thought that the movie had a great look ... all the shadows and the fog ... very film noir. <br /> <br /> Even though the actors do the best they can and the direction is nice, it is still not enough for me to recommend spending time to watch the movie. There are much better films of Glenn Ford: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
