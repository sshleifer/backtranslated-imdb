It should not be confused with the average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". The Sentinel was a great movie for me, it did not offer consistent action, a couple of critics promised in the back. It seemed to me that they were all half-hearted, and only there to make some quick money, because it looked a lot like a television movie. The Sentinel is a replay of several better films, like "In The Line Of Fire", this has no originality, and seeing Michael Douglas run, he felt a bit silly in my opinion. The main problem, in addition to its lack of originality, had to be the poor pace. I was often distracted while trying to watch this movie, while looking at how much running time I had, more than once. Not only the abuse with Eva Longoria, who could not convince the penalty. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, obviously he is going through the movements here. He does not convince like a man in a career, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it's just fine, nothing more than that. He tried to sound abrupt, but he managed to be more insipid than anything else and, to be honest, he did not seem so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role, and it was pure candy. Kim Basinger is quite terrible as the first lady. She seems bored to tears, and her role is a shot, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough to care about me. <br /> <br /> In a few words. The Sentinel is still another political thriller that bored me to tears. He's too old, too tired, and the most important thing is that the lack of effort stinks. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
