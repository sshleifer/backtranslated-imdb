This movie was funny sometimes, hell sometimes was even fun. <br /> <br /> The underlying message I got from the movie was that women are responsible for all of man's problems. Every time a woman is represented in the film, she is being lazy, dirty or beating a poor man for no apparent reason. I do not think the message in question is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> But, it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's simply someone's point of view. Even if I do not agree with that, they still have a right to it. <br /> <br /> A funny movie, but some of the comments that others have made are simply stupid. The best movie of my foot.
