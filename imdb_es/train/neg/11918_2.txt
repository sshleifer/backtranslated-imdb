It seemed to be a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie and, throughout the film, I expected it to be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that the talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval was really worthy of I praise, but despite the best effort, this film fails to convey a meaningful message, which seems to be what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The end point falls short and the end seems a little unsatisfactory after everything that happens; A bit like real life in that respect, but movies unlike real life end in about 2 hours and the end should leave the audience satisfied, if that is the intention of the director. This falls short in that sense and that is what disappoints me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that worried me was the national stereo characterization of American characters: they all seem to be carved in the same block. . It seems to me that most of the American characters in Indian films in English are based on how the Indians themselves perceive the Americans and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the film . <Br /> <br /> These two aspects together make up a disappointing story.
