Ok, I wrote a scathing criticism because the movie is horrible. As I expected another review (for Derrida) of mine, I decided to review the old reviews of this horrible movie. See all the positive reviews. ALL, I say ALL, come from collaborators who have not rated any other movie that is not this one. Crimminy! and wait until you get to the review [sic] of "rosebud". <br /> <br /> Check out the other Rosebud movies reviewed and with excellent recommendations for. Oh, shoot, they turn out to be for the only other films of the two writers and directors. Holy Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and Tony, you could not get out of a bad script. There are no jobs for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK THE POSITIVE OPINIONS FOR A LOW RATING FILM!
