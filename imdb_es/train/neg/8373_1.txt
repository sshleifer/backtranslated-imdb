I was not impressed by this film, especially the fact that I went to the movies with my family in good faith to see a movie that was certified as 12A here in the UK. To my dismay, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it's not good to see with children). This film was sometimes very crude sometimes with fart jokes, groin hits, etc ... and for the most part it is not very funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2-inch dwarf, gets out of jail and steals a giant-sized diamond, but then he is forced to put it in a woman's bag . So the rest of the movie sees him pretending to be an abandoned baby, entering this women's house so he can recover this diamond. <br /> <br /> Until now, I've enjoyed most of the Wayans Brothers production - but this movie is certainly taking the cake. <br /> <br /> A bit of good advice: wait for it to come out on television or cable
