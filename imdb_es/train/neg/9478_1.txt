If there were an Academy Awards ceremony oddly invested, this movie would win it all. It has all the gods, an excellent plot, extreme special effects along with extremely good acting skills and, of course, in each role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world were reversed, but it is not. Instead, it is the worst horror film ever made, not only the bad actors who seem to read the scripts of a teletype with bad dyslexia, but also the extremely low special effects. For example, the costume of the devil (which by the way is a must see), is one of the most fun I've seen in my life. Every time I saw that red-black monster called on the screen, I could not contain my laughter. And to make matters worse, it seemed that the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. Verifying that IMDB saw that the film premiered in 2003, had less than five votes and thought: "Well, it's worth trying, it can not be that bad". <br /> <br /> Yes, I could. <Br /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste any more words in this movie.
