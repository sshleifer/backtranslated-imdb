The film begins with a couple of campers, a man and a woman, presumably together, walking alone in the vast desert. Indeed, the man hears something and torments him so much that he goes to investigate it. Our killer greets him with a stab in the stomach. Then chase the girl and cut her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the killer's point of view. <br /> <br /> Next, we find our four main characters, two couples, one in which he is on the rocks. The men joke about how the woman would never be able to drive camping alone on a double date, which caused the blonde's chip-chip ambition to leave a week earlier. Unexpectedly, men leave on the same day and their car breaks down. They end up arriving at night. When men arrive, they are warned about people disappearing into the forest by a crazy Ralph Doppleganger. They ignore the warning and venture into the blackened night and a song of the eighties is played in the background with lyrics about the murder in the dark forest. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another clone of The Burning, but a ghost story! The women, frightened and alone, huddle together by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play spy on Tom. Well, obviously they are ghosts because of the way their voices echo. Her mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they have seen their children, before disappearing, of course. <br /> <br /> The children run home with dad and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river. This causes a stir and gets up, grabbing his knife from above the fireplace. "Dad is going to hunt," exclaims the girl with a bad performance. Here it is evident that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Scared by something in the forest, the blond token escapes, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. She meets the father who explains that he is dying of hunger and that he will be quick. This does not make sense because of the panther grunts we heard before (maybe he's allergic! Are they honestly panthers even in California?) She ends up hurting him slightly before being stabbed in the head. A thunderstorm breaks out and men seek refuge, which happens to be where daddy resides. Clearly, someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange is roasting over it. The children appear and warn them about Dad, who appears moments later. They disappear as soon as it arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer just chases the females. He invites the men to eat something and tells us the story of his ex-wife. We received a flashback from his wife being caught cheating. However, the old man does not tell them that he then kills her and his lover, but that he dreams daydream about it. We are not given the reason for the death of children. The men go to sleep and remain unharmed. The next morning the men discover the empty camp of their wives. After a brief discussion they separated. One is to stay in the camp, while the other goes and receives help. The one who returns to his car breaks his leg. Then we meet the children while they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who committed suicide because they were sad for their mother. They agree to help the woman to meet her friends. <br /> <br /> The next scene challenges the logic of the movie when dad kills the guy who is waiting at the camp. I was also dating or married to the blonde. In some way, the children realize that he is murdered and tell the woman. She decides to see it for herself and, obviously, meets the killer. Fortunately, children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever. You know where this is going. <br /> <br /> In general, the film deserves four stars out of ten, and that is being generous. Despite all your doubts, the musical score is well done. It is still visible too. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are well made. The plot is incredible. There is such a thing as a voluntary suspension of disbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; I can not imagine the token blonde taking off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
