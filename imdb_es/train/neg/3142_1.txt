Once upon a time there was a director named James. He brought us wonderfully, exciting science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These films were the things blockbusters were made of and he seemed to have a fantastic future ahead of him when the dawn of computer-generated special effects landed in the film industry. Terminator 2 showed that it gave us a glimpse of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ innumerable prizes .. ........ obscene amounts of money ............ extravagant alluvium of publicity ...... ...... maximum profit margin ...... .. Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I have never been (ever) one of those who got on the bandwagon and were too critical for the sake of de facto, I have often taken the opposite stance of the majority just to launch an argument . However, the Titanic was a film from which I only obtained a positive result: that of Kate Winslett being absolutely beautiful in everything! <br /> <br /> Quickly: the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the performance was more of wood than my nephew's tree house, the images that pretended to terrorize were actually comical (the man falls of the boat and hit the propeller), it's historically false (it does not even make me start because there's too much), it had thematic music (up there with the cheese bodyguard) and the meaningless love story was so tedious, absorbing and pathetic that it did not He respected the difficult situation of everyone involved (I was glad when he died and I was disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was obvious It is obvious that this image was designed to attract MTV viewers, chew gum, chase a boy with the car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself seemed somewhat less heroic than the member of a band of children) who would drag their sex. hungry boyfriends for a three to a half an hour of chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst thing was that he did not stop at that point. Millions of sleepy, vultures of culture went to see this costly waste of celluloid because "it cost a lot to produce it, it must be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies". <br /> <br /> The glory of the coronation came when the Titanic swept the tables at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a moment of serious silence for the victims of the fatal night on which his farce of three and a half hours was based. It seemed to me that I was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune by incorrectly portraying the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy this type of garbage, they deserve to be scammed. Good luck to Hollywood if that's how you want to make money, I would do it if I had that kind of opportunity in life! <br /> <br /> It's on my list of the worst movies of all time with another fool, historically false / human interest like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
