Disney still has to know a movie about which he could not make at least two sequels. And this was no exception for the people of Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to see it, I feel dejected to see it. <br /> <br /> Ariel has already grown and had a daughter. However, he does not allow the daughter to go to sea due to an idle threat made by the deceased witch's sister. So here we go again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is deceived (of course) and helps the sea witch. After a not so glorious battle, she is defeated and the sirens and humans live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to see here. Come back to your lives "RE-"
