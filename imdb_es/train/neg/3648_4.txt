A couple without children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that something is very wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> A pretty interesting idea is done thoroughly with a terrible script: the basic idea is fine, but It becomes very predictable towards the end. I saw every "turn" come. The direction is bad: it seems he has no idea how to shoot a basic scene. The values ​​of production are, to be pleasant, lousy. Very spoiled And, the bloody scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turn them off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with terrible special effects. The film is completely disrupted at the end, when it is quite clear that they had no idea HOW to end this movie. <br /> <br /> A good performance makes it a little bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are good at their roles and they kept watching me, but that was it. This movie barely made its debut in 1991 and remains unknown, it's easy to see why. I give him a 4.
