A memorable line of a short show. After watching the episode in which that line was introduced, my intramural football team of the fraternity began using the line to break our groups on the offensive. Instead of Ready / Break, our back room said: FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered you! A fun way to break the group in which our opponents scratched their heads, since very few of them had seen the show. The use of this line added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season during my time at the university that year and it was partly due to the fun we had when using this line. The show was quite stinky, but still alive in the memories of the Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag football team of 1977 at West Virginia Tech.
