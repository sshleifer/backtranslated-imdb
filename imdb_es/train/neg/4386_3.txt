With a title like this, you know you should not expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks it's someone else. This joke could work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! The actors are not that bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and completely stupid. Without suspense, without emotion and little gore (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically in that. It got so boring towards the end, that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I did not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but come on ... that was 13 years ago, and she has not done anything decent after that. So it's no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of garbage. Avoid or be warned.
