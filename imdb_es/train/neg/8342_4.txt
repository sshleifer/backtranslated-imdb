Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a horror film of the Christian Coalition. It's okay, maybe it's not so bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is harassed and possibly murdered by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite menacing and brutal). I say possibly because she wakes up and everything was a dream, or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that these fifteen minutes of plot (pretty well the first time) are repeated again and again. And as Claire wakes up each time and each scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I just stopped worrying about what happened to Claire and started wondering what a clumsy turn at the end I was going to solve this. <br /> <br /> I was supporting a session (which honestly would have made more sense) but instead got one of those too obvious endings by surprise (Think the Village or Below) Yes, the film collapses faster than what the directors of Donnie Darko cut. All the great final turns in the horror films The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience did not expect a left field explanation. (Hell, even the end of the canoe on the original Friday the 13th deserved a shake) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the rescue shouts a turn that ends with each scene change. Other annoying flaws are the piano sound note of a note (although the featured songs were decent) the obvious time of filler (Claire prepares the dishes, the plots of Claire's mother), the way Claire says "hello there someone "every time he thinks there is a murderer series around. <br /> <br /> Also some of the secondary acting roles (in particular, the mother of Claire played by Maureen Olander, who looks like a zombie Mary Kay) shows the actor for the first time the roots of low budget. <br /> <br /> Both are too smart in half and not smart enough. Salvage keeps your interest, if only to see how they will solve this problem. The problem is that they really do not.
