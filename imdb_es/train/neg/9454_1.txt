When my own son is begging me to leave the opening program of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to take my eyes out. He wanted to reach across the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last bit of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I have seen and I immediately wish to "unwrap", if only it were possible. The other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both better than this shit in the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink tonight to sleep in a vain attempt to forget that I have witnessed. this blasphemy about the good name of Seuss. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers, I tell him to stay with Austin or even resuscitate Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
