I can not believe I wasted my time with this movie. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad that I had nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and rare movies, but this had bored me to death. Bad deed and bad acting ruined him for being curious. You have to ask yourself what these people thought when they spent money to produce this movie. I wonder what I was thinking by looking at it until the end. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did you throw this? Was there an audience that likes this kind of movie? It must be because you can find it in almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> it deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, then this is for you.
