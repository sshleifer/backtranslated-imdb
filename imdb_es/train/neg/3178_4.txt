With movies like this, you know you'll get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the address and the story that is missing. That could have been overlooked if the jokes had worked better. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the parrot that speaks, there was not a hint of creativity that would be noticed in the movie. I blame the director for not using the premise to its full potential. Eva certainly has the ability to show more comedian, but did not have the opportunity to do so. In general, this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Apart from that it can be omitted completely.
