The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A story of Lady and the Tramp in two senses: rich / poor girl, and skill against the bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a blatant attempt to capitalize on the original's good name, but also a ridiculous and exaggerated Disneyfied disaster that is best summarized as "Rambo Meets the Black Stallion." Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero returns from an absence of 3 years, and suddenly he is Superman on horseback; in the original film, good, it was real and credible, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I have not been disappointed so much in a movie and sometimes this angered me a lot, I did not miss a clich√©. Bold manipulation of the audience: do the studio heads think that all you have to do with a loving audience of horses is to put nice horses in front of them, to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
