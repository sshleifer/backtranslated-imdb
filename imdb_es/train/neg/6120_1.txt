There are three types of bad movies: the cheap, the boring and the insipid. The only really bad films are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> Boring movies are just, well, boring; If you do not go fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Films without flavor have their defenders; but the fact is that they are masturbation aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only bad and cheap movies are really fun, because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately, beyond their means. skills and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is naturally bored and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and lack of funds and skills redeem it making it seem cheap too. This movie is hilarious and it could very well be the last really funny and bad movie that was made. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this in a theater, may God forgive me; I laughed so much that I left my seat, and also with most of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and his promoter husband, conceived this film as, in part, a satire unfortunately, the dereks clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to achieve it; consequently, the 'satirical' element manifests itself as the impression that some school girl has of the impression of a gay young man from the impression of Frank Rorshin on the batman entangler who tries to pretend that it is Robin - he does not fly over our heads, He has no idea where any human head could be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some supposedly serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - they're so incredibly cheesy, one wonders if someone Milk squirted in the eye . <br /> <br /> about Derek's infamous tendency to reveal his breasts: I can not imagine a photographic exhibition of less erotic nudes, it's so rare with those wide shoulders I can "Do not imagine what someone saw in her . <br /> <br /> As for the plot, as it is, well, it's not, Derek chases around Africa, and God knows why, then his father, Harris, pretends to act in a show manic puppets, and then, of course, there is the hunk'o'Tarzan who seems to have wondered in the ad without knowing that the subject has changed, probably because he has not seen a script - apparently no one has done it. <br /> < br /> despicable camera work, poor editing quality - if it were not for the trio with the chimp, the film would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real scream
