MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst movie I've seen in my life. First, you discover that the shooter has no bank account or record since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person could be so close to a president without mentioning a high-profile job. In addition, the security chief of POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would begin to get drunk if the president was shot. This movie sucks. I can not express how extreme this movie was. Each actor was terrible. Even the girl in the caravan park. I shit on this garbage. What a waste of time.
