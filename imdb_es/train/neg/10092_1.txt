Seriously, malicious movie. <br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with a policeman and his partner parked outside a store / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl, who had been arrested, to the store's attic, while the rookie policeman sits outside and reflects on what might be happening there. The "bad" cop finally returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the rookie cop does not think there's any problem, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a shitty answer, and then thinks that Everything is fine for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (he did a little better). But eventually people start to realize, which took a while considering how fucking obvious it was. A girl receives a voodoo curse in case she dies, like you. Now, the "bad" cop finally kills this magically protected bitch, and then gets rid of the body with a duffel bag. <br /> <br /> Since she was given the magic of oogey-boogey, she returns with a lot of eyeshadow, which is supposed to indicate that she can be a zombie ... also, the magic curse makes all the other girls become "eyeshadow monsters". Some of the girls meet a guy, who apparently is a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (apparently, they seem normal). But when the girls see other people, like the husband of one of the girls, he gets scared because she is horrible (some people get scared, but others do not even realize) ... massive hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> Then, to wrap it up, the monsters in the shadow of the eyes kill the "bad" cop, which in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for a sequel! As if someone wanted to see part 2 of this cow falling.
