This movie is not so funny, it's a waste of big stars, who seem to be trapped in their own stardom that they forget. Only the glittering moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to get dressed: he almost falls out of his chair with a helpless laugh when he dances with the "Bad Girls" of Donna Summer while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a delicate hat. The rest: Forget it!
