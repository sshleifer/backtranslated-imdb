I do not know why I'm commenting on this stupid reality show where I saw some episodes (a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something, I did not see everything, like three episodes) since I was nine months pregnant and I'm about to go into labor any day. Maybe I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, I really do. For all his It seems that he has very little sense of the dignity of money and fame. Or it is egocentric to the extreme. He married Federline (okay, anyone can make a mistake) and before that "starred" this horrible show about his daily life with him, where he puts a camcorder where he wants, no matter if it's in someone's face or in the shower when Federline is standing there. She's babbling about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination, I do not care about my part, but I can not help but wonder how she feels now when she's divorced. And yes, for your sake, I'm ashamed. But it should not be. It seems that she lives a fairly empty and superficial life. I do not want to exchange lives with her, even if I could. Road-kill TV if you want.
