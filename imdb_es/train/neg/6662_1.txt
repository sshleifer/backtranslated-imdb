* Spoilers and extreme attacks were ahead * <br /> <br /> When this show started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of caricature children and adults liked. He also had high marks along with Spongebob. But it started to fall due to the next crap that Butch Hartman and his team introduced into the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, bathroom humor is not so much fun. You can easily get a quick laugh from a small child with a burp, but that is practically the only audience that would laugh at such a clich√© joke. Then there are the children's jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see the people who are dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing at such gay happiness! Someone help me! But, of course, this show would not be so bad if it were not for the stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed the Australians? They saw them as nothing more than simple lovers of kangaroos, who throw boomerangs and live in a hot desert. But now ... Is it really the coup de grace of WHY this show is the loudest of all ... MANY OFFICES! The show constantly brings out the same jokes (most of them are not funny) thinking it's like the best thing of all! Cosmo is above all the culprit. I hated that they kept mentioning "Super Toilet" (which also has a mix of childish humor, too) and Cosmo would be scared. And who could forget the silly drum joke that all damn Dimmsdale parents would use in that one email episode? You know, the only one in which all the parents (other people's parents who say it) would emit the same EXACT phrase before entering their children's room? Yes, it can be first class humor for some people, but it is pure shit for other people. <br /> <br /> If I'm not wrong, I think Butch Hartman said something about the end of the program. Thank God! Everyone in my area says it's, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show of all time. I just can not agree with that? I think it's just another pile of horse droppings that we have in our caricature stations every day, only worse.
