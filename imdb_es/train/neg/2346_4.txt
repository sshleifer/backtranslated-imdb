I saw this movie for the first time not too long in the "Essentials" series of TCM. The eye of the viewer's clich√© was never more appropriate. This viewer saw little value in this. I was surprised by the infinite attraction that Lucy had (Lauren Bacall). Of course, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie her character becomes more fun than attractive. I would think that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would probably ignore Lucy instead of falling into an instant crush on her. In defense of Bacall, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorated health may have affected his performance. Of course, part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast it with the whore Marylee, played to the maximum and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she engages in a tremendously sensual dance while her father climbs the stairs wearily towards a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance eclipses the rest, though Jasper Hadley's fatigue over the disappointing behavior of his two sons is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I would have to say that I am not very fond of melodrama. The caricature behavior of the characters makes a story too unlikely for my taste.
