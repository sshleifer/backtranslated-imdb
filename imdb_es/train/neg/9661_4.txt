I mean, the performance is bad, but I think it was the direction that did it that way. I never thought much about Highlander (the same director), but you could blame one of the 80s. <br /> <br /> This, however, has no excuses. Do you shoot people as they leave the trenches with a man in front of him? Those kinds of mistakes, along with an unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, under par cuts and deficient visual effects, make this a film below par in general. <br /> <br /> Then, like so many others, He commented, all this American shit. The German general was practically afraid of his private American capture. Prepare to swallow a lot, although in small doses. <br /> <br /> In short, a film not horrible, but still below average in all aspects.
