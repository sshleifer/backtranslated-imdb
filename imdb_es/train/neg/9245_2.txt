This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. Very well done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry on the screen when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a Special Edition DVD with deleted scenes, comments from Bill Gates, a documentary of how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP, and more! <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 (Should have won at least one Golden Globe)
