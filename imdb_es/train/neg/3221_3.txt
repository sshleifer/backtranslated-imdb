I saw this in the tube last night. The actors involved first caught my attention. The first scenes were captivating attention. Some fun some sad. Good character development I felt that the last third of the film diverged. If it was not for the first part of the movie, I would have stopped watching it. I kept looking with desire how he related. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. Especially I did not like the extended period in which several of the characters spoke Yiddish (?) Was that the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would you recommend it? No I dont think so. As other critics mention, much of the jargon is dated (60's jive) but it did not distract too much. The end completely extinguished me.
