My comments can be a bit spoiler, so it's worth it. Stop now if you care enough ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have been titled "A very thin excuse for older British women to get the best on screen." This movie is silent. Incidental music is a nuisance, as are the obvious and trite melodies that appear sporadically to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky", for example: Oh, I understand!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie made credible by her impressive English environment and the overwhelming power of Brenda Blethyn to inflict emotion on an audience using only her voice. Literally, I could hear the people of the High Times magazine receiving their joy for the enormous "buds" that litter this image. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to sell her illicit products in the street of London with a white suit at full volume. It's not fun It's not original. It is not interesting. It is not a good movie. The score of 7.2 is the result of the over-voting of the fans. Do not waste your time ...
