This is, literally, the worst movie I've seen in my life. It can be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; This movie is so bad that it goes through a nice camp and it just becomes incredibly horrible. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of annoying, and my whole family got together for a fun night of intelligent comments; instead, we sit in a stunned silence, feeling sorry for poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the lively Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Do not, under any circumstances, allow this movie to come within ten feet of your television.
