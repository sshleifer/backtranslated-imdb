Legal Boston has turned his tail and goes to the door of the barn and the pig he has created! When this program was first broadcast almost four seasons ago, it was a comical slap in the face of the legal system that all actors seem to take pride in portraying. It was fun, diversified and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to a certain extent real in their representations. Sexual commentary and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series in which she participated, but now she is dragged to the lowest depths of media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is an excellent actor who from the days of "Benson" until this production became his in the field of entertainment, always showing humor and respectful production performance. Captain Kirk "is". Candace Bergan, funny and humorous, should be admired for her participation in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his ability to act, however, he must return to his XXX origins as "Crash", since he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be destroyed as it is and that it is really beginning to smell.
