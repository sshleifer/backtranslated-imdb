A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but everything is related to a stupid plot or something like that. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sexual comedies in history. Does anyone realize that this movie is making light of childhood sexual abuse? I guess it's okay because he's a teenager - if we had one with a man who seduced a teenager there (rightly so) it would be outrageous. I'm sorry, but to have done it to a child does not excuse it. He is still sick. I realize that Brown was of legal age (he was actually 18 years old when this was done), but it LOOKS to 15. I find it disturbing that some people find that this is fine. - but can not act; Brown is easily one of the worst childhood actors I've seen in my life) and constant nudity becomes boring and is not even remotely erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this nonsense in a theater in 1981. I was 19 years old and with my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily go through 18). He wanted to see it, I did not, but I decided what the hell? We went in and bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously underage. My cousin thought it was boring and the other three children went to the middle! Let me clarify this: three ADOLESCENT CHILDREN left a movie with tons of female nudes! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I'm surprised that this has ever been released. A 1 all the way.
