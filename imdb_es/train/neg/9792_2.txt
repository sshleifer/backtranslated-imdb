FIRST SHOULD BE SAYED THAT I HAVE READ THE SLEEVE AND, THEREFORE, MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES. <br /> <br /> This anime disappointed me greatly because it eliminated comedy and high-quality manga action and OVA. What he left behind was simply a shell of what could have been. Many of the characters lacked the depth seen in the manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character who secretly desires death. Walter's story lacks betrayal. And the Nazi villains who conspire to engulf the world in war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides the villain Gary Stu Incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime moves away from manga, but that it does such a poor job. .
