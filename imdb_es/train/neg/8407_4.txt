From the stupid video of the "colorful African natives" with our superimposed directors acting as narrators, to the horrible false ears that transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants, to the total lack of logic, to the incessant absence of Maureen O'Sullivan . moaning of "Tarzan! Tarzan!", there is nothing in this movie that deserves a classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
