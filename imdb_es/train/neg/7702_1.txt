I am a black man who lives in a predominantly black city. Having said that, I have some important doubts about the work of Tyler Perry. I realize that some people feel the need to praise him, because he is black and is trying to show a positive image of the culture. But, frankly, I think if it was Perry White, this movie would have had NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his butt. <br /> <br /> I've been forced to see this movie a hell Of a lot recently and every time I see it it boils my blood. The characters are badly written and act. The jokes are so bad that I have to tell them that something is supposed to be funny. I'm just going to break this big pile of shit. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have had some appeal, but he no longer has it. When all he seems to do is attack children and threaten adults with violence, it is less than useless. She is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife beating her fiance was silly. If a woman was so scared of her husband, why would she try to run away when he is sleeping in bed? Would not it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work? In any case, the characters in this arch were so annoying and overwhelming that he expected to be pulled from the balcony and, as expected, to ignore him. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two lovers. A bus driver asks a woman to harass her while he makes his rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. But, what the cake takes away is that an adult man was reduced to throwing stones at a window and passing notes like a ten-year-old boy for a mega castrating bitch. I do not use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. Victim morose and psycho mom. No matter which of these two faces showed, however, there was a constant. The bus driver was not going to get anything. He even married her without tasting the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the family reunion scene. Here we have the burden of the mother that includes implicit incestual taboos, grind to sharpen, shirtless, too muscular, b-ball, plus the great taste of Maya Angelou. When those babies dragged their butts out and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed for a heart attack. All this shit is happening at the meeting, in ridiculously easy-to-separate groups, and then a bell rings. When they do, everyone stops doing what they are doing and heads off to a stern conversation too, just like a pack of Pavlov puppies: WTF! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In it, we see her abusive fianc√© being mistreated by her longtime victim and everywhere bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where blacks dress like angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF! The only reason to see it so far, besides testing your threshold of pain, is the hope that the second villain in this story will also get his ass. Guess what, it does not happen. Instead, Perry takes the testicular and challenging path and plays it safe, ending the movie in a tone of forgiveness: WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that, if I get one day, I can probably write a doctoral dissertation about all the ways this movie sucks. I do not even mean the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'm just going to say this. In my opinion, as a black boy, D.W. Griffith's legacy is still alive. The irony is that he is doing it through a black man who will be praised for doing what he did The Birth of a Nation, selling us downstream. I wish Perry's movies were guys to be able to kick them. Thank you very much friend !! What will you continue with this in 2009, a comedy about rape and the savage beating of slaves in colonial America?
