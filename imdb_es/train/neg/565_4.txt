The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver". Instead of what the composers wrote in the stylistic period of the work's configuration, they simply wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatically and stylistically distorted. Do not mix well with some of the sunny colors that permeate the score. It is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly tart bad taste. <br /> <br /> The casting of the child Oliver does not help: tentative bell and viciously precious, here is something less than solid. Fagin performs his traditional routine appropriately, although the melodies he must sing have little basis in the period. <br /> <br /> "As long as you need me" is given a strident, guttural and tense interpretation. The two big production numbers, "Who will buy" and "Consider yourself" seem overproduced, with everything but the kitchen sink. It is a thing that must be overcome and another thing that crosses the line in excess. <br /> <br /> The pessimism, despair and depravity of much of the novel do not seem to lend themselves to such nonsense and choreography. Although the novel is considered a classic, I must confess that I have problems with the conscience of Mr. Dickens, since his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his personal life without joy, which was full of disappointment and repentance. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talents of this production, either inside or behind the camera, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the basic material. All this results in an uncomfortably disappointing experience for me. <br /> <br />
