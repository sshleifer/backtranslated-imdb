This movie was made and cast from my hometown. I remember the fuss about it and all the fuss over the fact that Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Essentially 20 years after it was He filmed a film To rest "without finishing, a group of film students set out to complete it, with terrible consequences.It seems that someone does not want the film to be completed. <br /> <br /> The story is weak. You have to remember that this is a comedy and, therefore, you have to play it a bit, but it did not have a real push, most of the characters are transient and the little information you get about them that you just do not care about seems irrelevant It's strange to hear Kylie's accent as an Australian again and it's nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role, but that does not redeem the movie at all God knows why the manufacturers thought they would go into Molly Ringwald, maybe because of the natur aleza of the film (in some way pays tribute to the films of the 80 / bad horror movies), but in reality an Australian actor would have done very well. <br /> <br /> When it comes to casting, many The performance seemed constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main chics - played "director" and "producer") seemed to be trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feeling about them. About on maybe? Just not as smooth as one is used to. <br /> <br /> The murderer. Sir. Could it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors, and a couple of disgusting scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It lasted 90 minutes, but I could have gone for less. Maybe if they had pressed the script it would have been better. They made them kill many characters, but not a true accumulation that killed them. Maybe if they had killed fewer people and concentrated on a terrifying atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy and that the elements were fun. Or so incredible they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
