I gave this movie 2 stars just because Dominic Monaghan really made an effort in his performance. Everything else about this movie is extremely amateur. Everything related to the direction of this film was very poorly executed. The director should not only reconsider what she is doing in her life, but maybe she should watch some movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a movie of this caliber makes him look horrible. Whoever the "actor" who played Jack's best friend was, he should never have been in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small movie, but maybe I should put a little more time and effort into the characters and their surroundings. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as I did) you will be very disappointed.
