Four years after his directorial debut with the art snoozer "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us that what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the boys. "Roadie" is a series of frat-boy that includes fights in the bar, hot harpies, Art Carney in an improvised wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually quite a lovely presence on the screen, and maybe in a smaller role (in a better movie) it could be really charming, but the Zalman King script is full of Stereotyped and impotent humor. The meat loaf is kept open and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie make appearances, and they all seem embarrassed. Certainly they should, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO STARS OF ****
