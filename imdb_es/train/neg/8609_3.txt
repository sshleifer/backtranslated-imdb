If you have seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous films and performances, you will recognize several of the jokes made in this strange piece of dreck. Written as a situation comedy, this film fails to capture any kind of pleasant chord, from the self-help doctor played by the always sexy like cut liver like Molly Shannon to the "I'm fat and, therefore, funny", John Linette The 5 wives in themselves are quite nice, and if this had been done as a pilot for a series of action and adventure, it could have worked. Instead, it emerges as a male fantasy that tries not to be politically incorrect.
