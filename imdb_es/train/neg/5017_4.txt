I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and, since I'm a Nick Stahl fan, I had to rent it out. In all honesty, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were several twists and turns quite intelligent, but somehow I guessed almost all before they appeared. And, in the end, in my opinion, the movie went too far. If you have to see it, you will see what I want to say. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl's performance was excellent (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but always played the same type of character ... too Paul Finch of "American Pie" for my taste. <br /> <br /> And, finally, the worst part of this movie has to be the unemotional performance of January Jones ... I guess a pretty face really is the only thing that matters in Hollywood.
