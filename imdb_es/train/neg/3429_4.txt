I got a copy of the writer of this movie in soulseek. I have to say it's pathetic and just painful to watch the two cops act, but I saw the movie as a joke and, as it's a tribute to the August subway, I've seen it in my book as an incredible movie. . Its quality and everything is pretty bad, but it is entertaining and something to talk among your friends. It reminds me of the troma but the good things. I recommend seeing this under two conditions, if you're bored and need a good laugh, or a lot, otherwise just leave it alone. It is recommended to download it securely. Or and the murders are pretty funny. like when the zombie tears Satan's worshipers and then stabs someone in the head.
