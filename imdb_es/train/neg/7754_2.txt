Spoilers will be in this. The movie could have been better if they had had a script, a director and a different CGI provider. Not much good The movie has a man who starts his own theme park ... err ... zoo on a desert island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and is called Jurra ... oops .. Primal Park. I do not care about scams, because there are no original ideas for this kind of movies, but this one just gives you a slap, R e p e t e d e. There is even the shaded head of the creature in the design. The Sabretooths, which are not Sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (only old cats that kill), are quite addicted, but the most important achievement is what I call "Sloggy". Because, after getting rid of a big cat, a hero relaxes a little because there's only one left. Enter the strange type of food that says: "No, we made three, the third is a monster that crawls with its front legs". Great, wonderful A group of college students are also on the island for a treasure hunt, there is evidence to enter their fraternity or gender cliques (I always thought I needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed his task, so I was excited about that. Ah, yes, the mandatory "Evil Capitalist Must Die" clique is in force with not one, but two! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these movies when you release the tooth jars of a Sabretooth statue (Courtesy of Sloggy), shrink a few sizes and impale the man by the throat. If only I had escaped so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
