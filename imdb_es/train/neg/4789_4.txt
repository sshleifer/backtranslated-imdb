The "Phantom" of 1979 was a horror film highly atmospheric, creepy, terrifying and very original and, in a word, cult. The first sequel to 1988 was bloody, witty, action-packed and very entertaining. After the first sequel, however, the creator of "Phantasm" Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. "Phantasm III - The Lord of the Dead" of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tedious, which makes it quite Disappointing compared to their predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, we are presented with the secret that lies behind the mysterious sentinel spheres (the silvery flying balls that suck the brain). From then on, a series of new and unnecessary and annoying characters (like Tim, a little boy in the style of "Alone at home" that is great to shoot, a Rocky, a black nunchaku hard and super great with a crew cut ) are entered. The film also has its qualities: Reggie Bannister is once again as great as Reggie's guitar, ponytail. Angus Scrimm is still quite spooky as the tall man, but the fact that the tall man speaks much more in this movie, makes him lose some of his chill. The character of Mike is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make much difference. The gore also keeps the film interesting enough to see it, but it's still a disappointment, especially because attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> After all, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable waste of time, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two "Ghost" movies can try it, but I recommend not setting your expectations too high.
