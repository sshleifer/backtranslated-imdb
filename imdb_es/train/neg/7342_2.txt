"The Man in the Attic" is a film set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really did not need to be told. <br /> <br /> Looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the film did everything possible to make this film look steamy and erotic. They use terms like "illicit passion", "forbidden subject" and "unlimited pleasures". They even show a photo of Neil Patrick Harris (the little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun. <br /> <br /> The story is about Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The supposedly "shocking" part of the film is this: Krista's husband finds out about it and forbids them to meet again. So, what do you decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward living in his attic. Woohoo! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So on, and so on. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not cover any new territory. It's an original Showtime image, which explains why the stars are a couple of actors on the B list and both appear briefly in the buff. <br /> <br />
