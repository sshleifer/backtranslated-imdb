I do not think anyone who sits down to watch this movie is waiting for something remotely to appear like a classic ghost story, but you must ask yourself when it will be over if you were ever afraid. This does not really work at that level, but the cast is trying hard and the movie does not point to one of those happy endings. The story is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and he brings his wife Laura (Susan George) and his daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). His friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the Consulate of the United States, helps them find a house to live and finds one that is enchanted. Some 140 years earlier, in the same house, a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills them both and then commits suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when the Fletchers arrive, it does not take long before strange things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes, ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletcher and begin to act like the Japanese that were before, and Laura begins to flirt with Alex, leading to an adventure. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more strictly and after pouring soup into Amy's throat, he goes to ask a Monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts make Ted, Laura and Alex perform their death scene as it happened 140 years before. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good television director, but he has made horror films and science fiction before and has worked with McClure in some of them. While this never comes close to fear or to the development of the atmosphere, it has two things that I liked. First, he does not have one of those boring endings where the couple embraces after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Second, you have Susan George in the cast! I have always been a fan of her even though she has appeared mostly in schlock but her performances are always first class. She also often appears nude, which she does here in two separate scenes, and although she does not have classic features, she has a unique Tomboy look and is one of the reasons she was so popular. But after appearing in silly movies like this, I think that led her to get out of business or work only sporadically. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts run when the Monk does an exorcism is practically worth a giggle or two. The conclusion is that this is nonsense and I hope George decides to resume his career.
