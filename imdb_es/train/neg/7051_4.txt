A film about how to deal with the problems of growing up and being honest with yourself, Blue Juice is a great advantage for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the true star of this film, while the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his friend addicted to drugs. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like surfing or Cornwall in the least you will see that it takes a long time before the movie seems interesting. The beginning is slow and it spends too much time in long shots of uninteresting landscapes. In addition, too many main characters make most of them one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but due to the shallow characters, you have no idea why they act in the situations in which they are put. <br /> <br /> Only the characters of Ewan, Sean and Catherine make it worthwhile to be in this movie. video, so it was only posted on video in the US UU after Ewan and Catherine reached general fame.
