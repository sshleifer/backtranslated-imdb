What is happening to the ITV drama. First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television drama I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Parents" is a complete disaster from start to finish. Whoever is responsible for the start-up of this drivel should receive P45 by special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most Drama / Thrillers, a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary for the plot to develop, but "Perfect Parents" took this to a new level, I suspended so much belief at the end from this nonsense that I felt I had been forced to feed myself with a "magic mushroom" truck, it was as if the writers had decided to try a "Drama by numbers" that involves some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia The only problem was when The great Eric Morecambe once said when he played the piano: "I am playing all the correct Notes, but not necessarily in the correct order". For your next Script guys, I suggest you try reading some more books about script development than "Script writing For Dummies." <br /> <br /> Due to the ridiculous Script and the absolute lack of Tension in the Direction, the acting was properly discreet, it was not the actors' fault, since the cast was first class. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this unfortunate drama should instruct their agents the next time Postman tries to deliver a script from the ITV Drama Department, make sure the mailbox is closed!
