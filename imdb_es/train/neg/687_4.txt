I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very nice supporting actor) was in this movie, so ... why did not I particularly enjoy it ?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the most poorly written and cliché "images A" I've seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is amazing how dazzling the writing was. I knew that the movie would be tedious when again and again at the beginning of the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next, and I was always right! And this is not because I am a kind of "intelligent film", but because almost no imagination or effort has been put into practice. In fact, it seemed almost as if the movie was just a long chain of clichés, all together! In addition, I found it a little irritating that Fred mistreated Carole throughout the film and, however, faithful to the convention, in the end came running towards him. Uggh! There's more suspense in a Lassie movie ("Will it bring people to rescue Timmy or the rope he's hanging from?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were some positive aspects of the movie. It was great to see Fred look like a lush exuberant at the end of the movie; It was quite believable and it looked like I had not eaten, shaved or slept in days. In addition, the "chatter" of Charles Butterworth provided some moments of mild humor. But all this was not enough to make this movie look different than a "B movie." It's a shame, ... it could have been much better.
