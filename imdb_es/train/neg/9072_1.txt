This movie has no argument or focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a stupid comedy, but the writers on the screen have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title does not agree with the movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them. The female character of the roommate (of That 70's Show) was the only person worth seeing. He was hilarious and stole all the scenes he was in. The others need to make sure that their own university diplomas are working, since they will need a different career than acting.
