Okay, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and after about 30 minutes of the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie about and, what is more important, I care to know what ends with" looks and I decided Either we needed medication to keep us interested in the "plot" or just finish the pain right there and then observe something else. We opted for the latter. <br /> <br /> I really liked "But I'm a cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is too silly and unreal for my taste, I'm sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
