The Bliss theme update is simply the latest in a long line of lousy local comedies that appeal to the conservative setting of the cinema. (For the record, this list, all the movies in which it seems that they try a castle-like miracle, includes, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. worked has been Crackerjack.) <br /> <br /> Here, the performances never fit, since John Howard does not even seem to be in the right movie. although perhaps that was the intention, since Franklin plays in sleepy and conservative suburbs against its most interesting inhabitants. The 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming more rare on the screen, but this is not a reason to watch the movie. In fact, the only reasons can be (1) The strange ones of Howard? but pretty fun ?? performance, and (2) the theme 'suburban nightmare', which has been developed in Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good / excellent. Enter at your own risk! It can be one for people who titter on the word 'penis'. 4/10.
