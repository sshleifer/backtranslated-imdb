After seeing half of this movie, I noticed something peculiar ... I found myself constantly changing through TV channels to see what else there is, it's not exactly a good feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie appears as being in several genres, and I must say that it mostly failed miserably in each of them. At 80% through the movie, I switched to see an old replay. In short, the whole movie felt as if the people who did it did not know exactly what to do and ended up in a mix without noticeable flavor.
