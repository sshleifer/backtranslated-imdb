For all its visual delights, how much better the Renaissance would have been in the live action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, very similar to the history and style of this film. With real actors, maybe the world of the movie would not have felt so lifeless. There is much to admire here, but in the end I discovered that all I could do was admire. I did not like the film very much, and it clarifies something I did not see before: that the visual elements can be the definitive positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, everything can be in vain. I will not go so far as to say that this movie is useless, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies that I found wonderful. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain and Dark City had his arc of history that makes one think. The rebirth has shadow and light, but little else. I wish I would have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters got in the way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the most somber and lifeless films I've seen this year take its Renaissance title.
