Absolutely terrible Mexican film supposedly based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist who wants to enter the confines of an asylum hidden in the forest to write a story about how it works, etc. When our hero, Gaston, is given the great spectacle of Dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things that are supposed to be horrible, like men who remain in a dungeon, and comedies, as the heroes of our hero are joked by soldiers as he goes down a ladder that hangs on the side of a building. Then there is a view that could have been both: a human man dressed like a chicken, yes, that's a chicken, pecking around the earth to feed the chickens. The scene was going to be a comic highlight of the movie, but, at least for me, it was the low point of the movie and really more disgusting when you considered that adult men and women thought this might even be entertaining. Ah! That is really the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of name changes. And that brings me to this outstanding fact about the film, which is the majority of movies that undergo multiple title changes and usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone can buy the same garbage without suspecting more than once. This is definitely crap. It has very little in its favor. The only artist worth taking a look at is Claudio Brook, the head of the asylum. It is a huge piece of ham, since it laughs maniacally, shouts the orders, dominates with the sword in the hand and praises the chicken. I got so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as his means of healing the mentally ill. What a pile of ludicrosidad (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this deserves this kind of words). It will not take you long to find out what is happening in the nursing home or it will be more interesting. Kinematic scratch of chicken!
