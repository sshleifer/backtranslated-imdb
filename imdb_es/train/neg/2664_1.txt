An enthralling and cliche thriller has a young couple conducting research through the countries of the most infamous homicide sites in the United States, and becomes a road companion with a silly girl and her growling boyfriend, who is a psychopath Arty and alienating, the tone of the film alternates between pseudo-irony and silly extravagance. Handmade perhaps, but ultimately laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as the low-income killer is tremendous. * since ****
