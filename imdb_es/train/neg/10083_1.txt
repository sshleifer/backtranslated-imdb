They changed the title of this atrocity to An unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains a dialogue that would laugh at a third-grade game recital. At a time when the wife leaves the husband, a bad version of All by Myself plays the soundtrack! Seriously. The actors try, but they are defeated by the inept, incredibly terrible script. The address is surprisingly bad. It's no wonder that Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How are things done like this? I turn off the television before it's over!
