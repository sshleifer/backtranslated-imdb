The people who are praising this film are the real disappointments: I hope that at least Leonard sees a good amount of money, since his savings were saved by a manager a couple of years ago and now he is over 70 years old. . But this movie is just terrible. At first, Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then, for the next hour and a half, the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. He is so bloodily PRECIOUS with his endless approaches of overly emotional singers. Cohen's interview is done in low fidelity video close-ups and I wanted to see a half or a large part of his whole body! I could not care less about the comments of the artists, especially the exaggerated ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this film has made a song as good as Leonard's own music and if you're thinking about seeing this and have any doubts, pay attention. This would be a special PBS acceptable, perhaps, only once. But I'll even hesitate to get a DVD of this. When the film finally shows Leonard semi-performing "Tower of Song" it is ruined by Bono taking a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, the first issue of Rufus, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this torrid blabla. Forget about this, and go buy the latest Leonard album if you want to pay tribute.
