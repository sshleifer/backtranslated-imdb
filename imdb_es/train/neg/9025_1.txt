Sorry, this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw a lot of promotional material and I expect a professional movie like "Stormriders"; What they presented to me was a low budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on television. No Atmosphere, very boring, more than worse scenes of Struggle. Some good ideas - no more. I hope to have the opportunity to make a movie like this and then show how to make a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> My ASIAN advice: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
