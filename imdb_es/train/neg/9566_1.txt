I see many movies. He saw the original war games years ago and I loved it. Computers were still "a great mystery" to most of us and the film was convincing, in its own way. <br /> <br /> This, however, seems to be a low-budget Wednesday night special. Total shit, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not point to an actor who really did a good job in this movie. But well, with that script, I would have been surprised that ANYONE could do a good job of acting. Many clich√© scenes. It seems that CGI is taken from the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood when writing about this. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste it watching fucking movies.
