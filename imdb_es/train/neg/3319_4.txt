I was surprised when I saw this movie. I had heard it was the best movie in the novel. How disappointed I was <br /> <br /> How any true Jane Austen fan can describe this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The writers have decided to bet on a ridiculous humor that is shameful at best, but also ruin the feeling of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is a pretty shallow heroine (but then any "hot" American star would be questionable on paper), Toni Collette is a villain, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I really could not say anything good about this movie. It seems that I am among the few who do not qualify, but if you want my advice, see the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale: believe me, that is much preferable to this superficial garbage.
