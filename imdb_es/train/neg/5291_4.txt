Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence for his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together but ends up coming out more like a doormat. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing habit of drug addiction that is making him descend. The movie follows these desperate characters as they grow along with their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them in this way. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It's the story of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, the kind that Jeremy Kyle ate as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of self-destructive men, separated by three generations and each copying the other, destroying a family and women trying to keep it together, despite not being strong enough. If you catch a little of what it's all about from the off-set, you can see that it does not promise to be cheerful watching from the start and it certainly does not disappoint in this. <br /> <br /> It is true what everyone said about the performances, and the main stars, Winstone and Burke, offer a great performance. We see Winstone losing him to his wife, rendering her senseless after a bit of paranoia induced by the coke, breaking up during a telephone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of words when she refuses to let him see her son. Similarly, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose his composure on a ladder, the full impact of the night before he starts. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those movies where there is not an 'argument' to follow. As such, it is just a real-life sensation of these desperate lives that continue from one day to the next. It has been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) But it really was too bleak and gloomy for me. I have no right to criticize him for this, knowing what he knew about it, but unfortunately that is how I found it. **
