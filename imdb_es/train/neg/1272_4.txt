Did anyone else notice that every time they are in the car, every time the camera takes a new angle, they change the road? As in a scene, it is a one-lane residential with sidewalks, then they are on a multi-lane road with a divider, next to a two-lane rural road with two yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget, but that was just a sloppy movie job. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you're a Paul Reiser fan and his comedy, then you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find your work / is not fun, I would recommend that you stay away from this.
