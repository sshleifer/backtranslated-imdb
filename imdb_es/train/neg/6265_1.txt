It turns out that I'm the director's nephew. It took me years to get a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle does not even have a copy (I asked him). I hope to bring you a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently the average rating of the movie is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, that should be somewhere in the mid-30s in the "top 100" of IMDb. However, with only 206 votes, it has not yet been placed. <br /> <br /> It is sad that the film does not even receive the respect of a title lower than 100. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this year I will give copies of the film to the members of the family as Christmas gifts. Best / worst gift of all?
