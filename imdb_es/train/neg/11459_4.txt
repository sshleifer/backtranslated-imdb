A group of yahoo whale exploiters capture a female and tie her by the tail fin. The whale mate sees everything, including the moment when the unborn baby of the female slips and falls on the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that the big male is really angry at the way he stared at him, as if to say, "Get out of town before high tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not much more. This was Bo's first 'released' movie, although his first job as an actor was four years earlier in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this revision (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope that Bo has a 'whale' at a good time ... do you understand? ... a whale? ... hehehe
