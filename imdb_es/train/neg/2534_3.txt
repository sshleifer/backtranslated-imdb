* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes subtitled "Life Everlasting". It is often taken as a reference to the final scene, but it describes more precisely how dead and buried an estimable series is after this careless and illogical dismissal. <br /> <br /> There is a "hey kids, let's put a show air" on this telemovie, which can be endearing in places. Some fans will feel like insiders, as they enjoy choosing all appearances of cameos. Co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his friends crowd the events with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> That is at the head of the returns of virtually all the members of the television program varied models, their old favorites and those who are not later. <br /> <br /> There was always a tug of war, quality-conscious executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against NBC executives worried about the budget, who simply wanted a procedure police of another type like "Nash Bridges", that regularly beat "Homicide" in the qualifications. The pressure expressed when the show bounced between a fascinating realism that transcended its form and a sordid sensationalism that degraded it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana, co-writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story in the series, overcame it with a new improbable and artistically unsuccessful plot, and put the burden of bringing the whole mess to one of the weakest members of the cast. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, It has been some time since the last episode of the show. The old heart of the Baltimore homicide unit, Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, is now a candidate for mayor of Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke himself makes an appearance. But this promising start immediately takes a tragic turn in an unlikely manner. <br /> <br /> The center of attention moves to Giancarlo Esposito as the son of Giardello Mike. A handsome man who has done a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the pretty faces that was brought in late to, supposedly, liven up the television series. But the question for the audience was always: is Mike as uncomfortable as Gee's son or Esposito so uncomfortable on paper? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito does not have the opportunity to play the main story without interruption. This is because the writers choose this moment to revive another plot that spit the intelligence of the faithful voters of the program. <br /> <br /> An apparent video of tobacco transmission was promoted, and then it seemed that it really took place, on the Internet. After some false leads, the detectives arrested a suspect repellent. But the deputy prosecutor of Zaljko Ivanek, harassed and overburdened, forgot to submit motions in time, and the suspect was released, but was later killed. <br /> <br /> Let's summarize: you forgot to file the documentation because it was not like that. the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland Legislature, the US Attorney General. US, NBC, Court TV, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L ' Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World did not call every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case. <br /> <br /> However, the old gang of detectives and associates returns to Baltimore to help. There is a great variety of talents on display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogues to be distributed, some of them are simply on display. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are underutilized criminally, while the time lost in Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on ads. The writers seem to satirize this, presenting Jason Priestley as the ultimate big business detective. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a very shocking scene. <br /> <br /> There are other clever releases, with current Lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. The guests come from other programs, such as Whitney Allen, who works without stopping and the clueless "Miss Sally" of the children's program loved by the inmates in the "Oz" of Fontana. Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appears as herself. <br /> <br /> However, even when they are entertaining, these guests can distract. Ed Begley Jr. really advances the story in his brief appearance, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich of Fontana's "St. Elsewhere". He is still a living character, and fits into a hospitable environment. So, do you remember that San Elegio did not become the fantasy of an autistic child? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects the corporate synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought the rights to repeat the series. That network legally contributed to Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the Homicide team and then appeared in "Oz." The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, that is, drawing points for those who arrive late. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns around, Lucaitis also skillfully handles some physical comedy with Esposito. . He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. Maybe those two should have made a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the film ends, the plaster cream rises to the top. Although they are loaded with a losing script, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor surpass it. His performances remind viewers what he did of Homicide, by considerable stretches, the best program on the air and one of the best television productions. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the best professionals do their things; It's a pity that this movie does not give them more possibilities. Fans of fanatics may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.
