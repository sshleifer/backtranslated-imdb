I've seen the first of the dwarf movies and sometimes I had a little fun watching it. There are many famous TV / comedians that appear in the first part and present, in fantasy costumes, small typical episodes of their Stand-Up Program and that is exactly the problem that the second movie has to fight. Everything was already there ... nothing new to obtain. You know most of the "jokes", often boring and stupid, and you always feel that your goal was to put in each comedian of the last decade who wants to return to the stage. There is nothing important about the story: typical Rumpelstiltskin fairy-tale story, without any importance. I expected something like that, but that's nothing I can complain about. In fact, I complain about the lazy writers who had a full background story; his only business was getting many jokes and parodies inside, but they did not understand it anyway. This shit is, except for the great appearance of Helge Schneider, a total waste of time and money. (If you do not like it, then delete 2 points from my evaluation) If you want to save money and get bad jokes, look at the shit that is. Expanded issued every Friday night on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll recognize some "fools" that I saw last night at the movies.
