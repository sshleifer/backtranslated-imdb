Why do I watch movies like this? - aside from the fact that I have a strange mistaken masochistic belief that one day I will find a true jewel among all this scum, I can not think of a good reason. This film was scum from start to finish, but semi-hilarious scum. Where else in a bad Italian dubbed film could you find heated exchanges of mutilated Surrealist English like this between an honest military guy and the sinister boss of a secret X file as the organization dedicated to hiding "The Truth" ?: <br> /> <br /> Man in black: silence is the best for us until we can show that UFOs do not have bellicose motives. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I find your abusive interference. <br /> <br /> Man in black: the one who has to impose his will is. <br /> <br /> I rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half-dozen times and I still can not make those lines. It means anything sensitive. My other favorite line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be very hard on those who contravene our interests". <br /> <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> For me, the other highlights of this boring plonker of a movie were the fully spaced performance of the photographer character at the beginning. Suffered with the worst haircut ever, the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish with a bad wig until he was kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by some aliens. The aliens are not seen more effectively as a point of view (handheld camera with fisheye lens), something creepy the first time, but it is used again and again and loses its power (incidentally, if it's a Point of View shot). , means that aliens always leave the rooms backwards for some reason). <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in "England". This meant that Spanish Italian set designers placed some British license plates on a couple of English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's press card ... and that was it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK at all. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When Foley artists did not notice that the characters they followed (is there a word like that?) They no longer walked on gravel, but now were on the lawn, so their feet were still doing strong "crunches! Crunch! " Noises Apart from that, another total loss of 90 minutes of my life. I hope you prove that these UFOs have no bellicose motives soon ...
