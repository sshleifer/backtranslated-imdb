There is a comment that one of the heroines was raped in "drunken drunkenness" by Russian soldiers, which is completely false. This movie should not be shown just for this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone, that the KGB processed "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis". The KGB was looking for the so-called "Zionist" agents, which were (the KGB believed) imperialist agents. This is totally different from attacking the Jews as a whole nation, as the Nazis did. The gypsies were never prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool and was used politically, but from the internationalist point of view. The Communists did not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the KGB in general seems totally false. Some of the so-called "Russian proverbs" are totally invented, and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch it: this movie is full of lies and false things. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
