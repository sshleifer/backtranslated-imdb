I hired this movie waiting for some laughs, hoping it would entertain me, but I was very wrong. This movie showed very few moments of humor and pathetic jokes made me feel ashamed to have hired ... Directed to a group of 10 to 15 years, this film will leave viewers out of these limits feeling very dissatisfied. It is worth no more than 3 votes highly not recommended for anyone who does not want to lose 2 hours of their lives.
