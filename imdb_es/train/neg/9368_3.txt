Oh, a vaguely famous actress in a movie in which she plays a mother for a child. It shows on BBC 1 at 12:30, I wonder if ... yes, it's a TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give it to TVM producers, not happy with making a mediocre movie. In general, they offer us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed and NOW CAN NOT HIDE is not different. The first issue is a woman in danger. A pollinator crossed with a woman who suffers the pain of a divorce issue, which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving an assassination attempt followed by a scene where her son Sam asks why he divorced. And like TVM, he responds that the reason is "that people change" instead of saying something like "I` a right slapper" or "Your daddy cruises mens toilets for sex" as it happens in the cases of divorce in real life. I'm sorry for the young Sam, not only because his parents divorced, but he is as thick as two short boards, in fact, since he is so stupid that he does not deserve any sympathy because he does not know that a man is throwing things on the floor. The bathroom is a drug dealer, not knowing you could die if someone shoots you, and not knowing that I LOVE LUCY is painfully inconvenient If only our own childhood were so innocent, well, Orwell said "Ignorance is strength". Oh wait, Sam is suddenly an expert in marine life, is it a character development or a poor writing? I know what my money is, and it's strange that Sam, the genuine child, has not noticed that if the history is set in 1994, why do people often or wear clothes, drive cars and travel by train from the 1950s? It turns out that during a turn of the plot it is the mother who is the doll. Then there is a final twist to the plot that made me feel like an idiot to see this.
