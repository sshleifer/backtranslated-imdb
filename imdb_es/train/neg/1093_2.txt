Kitten Natividad, from the famous film by Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has discovered that she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) That is supposed to have healing powers . After consuming a bit of this fruit (which seems to be plastic bananas on the stems), chastity is endowed with some magical mystical powers that make it a superhero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Keep in mind that she also wears a pair of panties like a mask. In writing, all that sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip club is upset because it is taking away their business, so some of the strippers (including Haji, also from Russ Meyer) chase her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity defends herself under the guise of Double D Avenger. Watch her make a "Wonder Woman" spin to change into her outfit and also lose balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and malicious double meanings fly as if there were no tomorrow. With the inane theme that is reproduced again and again, this is presented as a twisted "live action" children's program from the 70s with adult content, although if it is not qualified, it could probably get away with the PG-13 in the worst case. And it's probably a blessing that faded stars stay well covered. This makes the films of Doris Wishman Chesty Morgan look positively wonderful in comparison. Special apparition of Forest J. Ackerman but so what? Very stupid, and I'm never going to buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10
