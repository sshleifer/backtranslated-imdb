Before the release of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-educated creatures. They certainly had much better manners at the table in the old days. But apart from the social label, what emotion did these first zombies offer to the audience that goes to the movies? Judging from this movie, none at all. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombification. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets out to build his army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since this is a movie from the 30s, zombies say they are more like sleepwalkers than the carnivorous variety we know today. They seem to respond to mind control, instead of insatiable appetites. And, frankly, the "revolt" is also disappointing. The whole thing is really boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no exaggerated melodramatic theater to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this could have provided much entertainment even 70 years ago. Look at it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would advise you to skip this one.
