At the beginning we can see the beginning of some secret advice of some kind. Everything seems very promising from the beginning. With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery becomes more interesting per minute. The main character who appears to be a good guy gets into trouble because of his claim to money to which he is entitled (to temptation) and other factors. You really identify with the boy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Normally a person in your situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there seems to be only one solution, even when it is clear that it is not their fault. Out of nowhere, he encounters characters that speak of the church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to your problem. It should be obvious at one point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always useful. But it was really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the visual experience for me. While the message is good, its simplicity can not escape the fact that in real life it is necessary to occur more to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery that is presented to us is never solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another issue that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell. The formerly brilliant actor is suitable, but if you look closely, you will see that it is nothing serious. He really must be desperate for the money. Otherwise, he would have an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.
