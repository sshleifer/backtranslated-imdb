3lbs is obviously just an indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to be a deep-seated producer / doctor in a bad mood. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and, unlike Gray's Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are not even interesting. This program is supposed to be located in a leading center of neurological cases, but there is nothing interesting or exciting! Not even the so-called pathetic "fight" between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither does that hallucination. In the pilot program there was a brief look at the social life of potential clients as a parent: snooze! Bored and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This show is a pair of pants, there are a lot of medical dramas right now and this does nothing to make it stand out as special.
