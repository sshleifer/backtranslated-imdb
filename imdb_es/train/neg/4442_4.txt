I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but all that was too much. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the good life of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the look of the city that the director shows. Everything seems too false to me: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a little taste of the false Latin American culture. I must be honest: it seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by those false lives made of good music, sex and parties? I am not so stupid: what kind of world is this in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with the phone call from Caridad's mother and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spaniards.
