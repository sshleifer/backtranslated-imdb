The brain that would not die is a horrible movie that reeks of the initial credits. It has all the classic signs of being bad: incredible plot, terrible acting, low quality settings and lighting. The plot is as follows: when a doctor and his girlfriend are caught in an accident, she is beheaded and he raises his head and takes her to his laboratory, where he places his head in a pan with a special liquid that keeps it. live. I bet Virgnina Leath, who touched her head in a pan, had to spend a lot of time uncomfortably using that pan around her neck and crouching under a table. Anyway, the doctor tries to find you a new body and hires two strippers so you can choose one to have your new body. Bad all the time, so bad that it was destroyed in Mystery Science Theater 3000.
