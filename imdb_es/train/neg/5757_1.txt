The movie could be seen while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight against fainting when the film depended on Meryl Streep to carry scenes without Jack; She was as insipid as she could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; These characters have been portrayed before, and much better. It felt like a scenario based on real life in the worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring and it is not worth writing about it or seeing it. Why Ephron felt that his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough for me to escape. Maybe he wrote it as therapy: for many writers, putting an episode of his life on paper is cathartic. Well: but for me, why someone in Hollywood felt that it was worth filming this story is still a mystery.
