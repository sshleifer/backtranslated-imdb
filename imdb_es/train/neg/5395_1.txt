Kenneth Branagh tries to turn the dark and rarely produced comedy of William Shakspeare into a musical of the 1930s, with the result of being bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy, since the actors are rarely experts in one or the other of the two styles and in some cases it is wrong in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to have the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard but is very wrong, and Alicia Silverstone, who handles the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a Valley Girl teenager who is reading the script in voice high in it. English class in high school. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are organized with the experience of a high school production of "Dames at Sea", leaving the uncomfortable and amateur cast as they sing and dance, with the sole exception of Adrian Lester, who He demonstrates as a splendid song and dancer. The other saving grace of the film is the contribution of Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as goodies, but they have given better results than in this film and it would be prudent to review some of the other titles in their films and give this Witless Mess a pass.
