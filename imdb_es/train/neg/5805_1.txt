Anyone who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin, trying to imitate the late Steve McQueen, in a word-by-word remake, simply does not work. While Baldwin has done an admirable job, this is a failure from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never tried to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough. McQueen seemed dangerous, threatening and credible as Doc, the film had enthusiasm and suspense, Baldwin and company turned this into a comedy, I laughed the only time I saw this miserable movie. And that horrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of the most exciting and credible actors of today! Did makeup people have it for Michael, what were they thinking about? If you want to see how a movie is made the way it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah, get the original!
