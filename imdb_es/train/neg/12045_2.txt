Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I use it as a reference for quite some time. Therefore, I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I hope not to bother you. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (everything that the Greeks did in reality), analyzing Omirus epos (and not Homeros as you see everywhere), rhyming by rhyme. If I remember correctly, she was Iliada (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odyssey (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment to me and to my Greek colleagues throughout the campus (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literary works that have been made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus during the 400 years after the war. Historians put the Trojan War around 1200 BC, and the real reason for the war is not the beauty of Helen but the crucial strategic position of Troy. That said, it can now be understood that Omirus epos does not present the real events (since historically it is not accurate), but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> When reading this huge poem, one can find oneself wondering about the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best and most educational part were also these prolonged conversations between the warriors before the battle. However, none of these was revealed in 'Troy'. <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap for my eyes, and for other intellectuals, Finnish colleagues and English Germans as well. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, perfect storm was a bad and stupid box office success (computer graphics did all the work) and, nevertheless, it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that it is better that you look at something else. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Alex
