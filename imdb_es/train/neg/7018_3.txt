Totally forgettable. Especially for the weak performance. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he has been around since the late 1990s. I thought he was a newcomer, since his performance was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen her do well in other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the type of actress who will give the character a fiery and emotional personality as Diane Keaton would be able to do, but it was quite strange to see her say her sentences in whisper mode. It seemed that, on the whole, there simply was not a very good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton also perceived it. She's a fantastic actress, but she seemed a bit exaggerated in this movie. I felt that I just wanted to finish this movie as soon as possible. I would not blame her.
