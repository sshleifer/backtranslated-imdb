For some reason, in the late '70s and early' 80s, the local station affiliated with CBS in New York continued to play this movie in its nighttime on Friday or Saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 a.m. It is a suitable movie for that space of time, since it is very difficult to follow and quite strange (see the other reviews for specific information on the story). Anyway, after capturing it several times in those days just before cable TV (and even after it hit but before they offered much programming all night long), I kept catching this little weirdness. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it's only available (from all the searches I've done anyway) on a pretty bad grainy print on the "Brentwood Video" budget label as part of a 4-film package (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) called "Alien Worlds" if someone is interested. It is usually available for around $ 10, but even less if you make purchases. The other 3 films in this set are available in many other public domain movie collections, so it is not necessary to comment on them here. But I have not seen "Eyes" available anywhere else. Although it is not a "restored" version in any way, this impression lasts exactly 92 minutes, so for once, the IMDb execution time of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the 92 minute run time, it is not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have a bit of run time set. It seems to be a common practice of budgetary awareness to save money by not bothering to copy some scenes if they are not considered important for the story. Would a longer version be less confusing? Who really knows, unless you've seen it in your native language ... By the way, my attempts to see this during the day do not work and I just turned it off. There's something about seeing this in the middle of the night that fits this movie ... or maybe it's just from my previous experiences, who knows?
