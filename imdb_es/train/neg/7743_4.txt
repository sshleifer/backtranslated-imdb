This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of comedy and police drama about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shooting at a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is designed and there are too many secondary problems in progress. Ford is rushing real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he is rushing chickens in his spare time, both are under investigation by Internal Affairs, Ford is fucking the ex girlfriend (Lena Olin) of the AI ​​researcher and she is a psychic who has a radio show, the man who organized the murder at the club is a dirty former policeman who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Throw in the compulsory car chases and some unconvincing humor attempts, and that's the essence of this turkey.
