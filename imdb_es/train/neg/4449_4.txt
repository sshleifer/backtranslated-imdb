"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable thriller, "been there before", which never seems to find inspiration, no matter how desperately the team and team try. I can not believe that a group of my friends convinced me to see this in the cinema about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The total lack of originality of the script of Ronald Bass (based on the novel by Nancy Price) does not help, nor the address of Joseph Ruben or the average performance of Julia Roberts. The cast, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, do little to help. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
