To complete the "Our Gang" release schedule of 1929-30, "A Tough Winter" presents two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, alone at home on a winter day, decide to make some candy. Little Wheezer transmits instructions to Mary Ann of a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer transmits information from different programs and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! The fun moments occur when the rest of the gang appears to attract the taffy, and ends up getting it all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second story is about Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / handyman of the gang, and his interactions with the gang. <br /> <br /> "A hard winter", as far as I know, has never been shown on television, although it is available on the home video. The reason for this is the characterization of Stepin Fetchit that shows a cunning, cunning and slow character. The producer of "Our Gang", Hal Roach, called Fetchit a "comical expert" and used this entry of "Our Gang" as a pilot of a comedy series by Fetchit that never saw the light of day. Understandably, the characterization of Fetchit is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been archived. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun times with both Fetchit and taffy, "A hard winter" is hard work. serpentine effort If a positive result of this film was that the Hal Roach Studios acquired confidence and experience in doing interviews. The sound in the movie is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partly paved the way for the excellent films of 1930-31 "Our Gang". <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
