The only good part of this movie is the beautiful landscape. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit when his son Paul deviated from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can your children take the name of the Lord in vain in this film because it is of Presbyterian origin? It does not fit I wished that Paul was dragged down the river without a boat at the beginning to avoid the silly, smiling and selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler that Norm wants to rescue but does not want, so what? It is very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites that Paul was defending because of his Native American. That was the only part that had any interest and maybe could have become a true "wild west". What we only see is a sleepy town where the children of the two ministers have nothing to do except 1. Norma chases a lame bride and deals with her family and 2. Paul makes up silly stories in the newspaper shop while scratching head and take a lot of drinks and tie many flies. I'd rather watch a show about fishing that movie again, which will never be.
