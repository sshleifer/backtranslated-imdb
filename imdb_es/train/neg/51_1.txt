This movie was a big disappointment. The level of cruelty and relentless violence in this film was very disturbing. Some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and petty. The main characters were impossible to identify or sympathize with. The character of the main character was as viscous as they come. The nursing / greenhouse environment lent itself to exaggerated theatricality. From this film you can learn little or nothing about the Spanish Civil War. Fortunately, I've been to Spain and I realized that this is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a frightening "horror" was also very offensive and mismanaged, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to appeal to gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I suppose if you like to see children and pets brutally murdered, this movie could be especially attractive to you.
