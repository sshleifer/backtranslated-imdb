I had to watch this movie because the plot was so scandalous and the film lived up to expectations. In fact, it is quite uncomfortable to see her sometimes. Unlike other Meyer movies, sexual antics are minimal. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the performances and the lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of slavery's brutality and immorality and fails in all aspects. . It's as if Meyer tried to compensate for sexploitation / blackploitation by having a superior moral message. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty about the excitement of the dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit. Then he tries to return to the straight path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing. <br /> <br /> Because it's so bad in many ways, it's really worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst case. possible flavor. Maybe, because it's so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.
