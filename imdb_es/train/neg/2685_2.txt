I have never moved a movie online, but I felt moved to do so, after seeing this one. One does not show up at someone's funeral and says to the bereaved: "My relatives died, so why should I worry about their family?" <br /> <br /> Without the propaganda, there was little or nothing that could be called "art". As the daughter of deaf parents, I was especially upset with the use of deafness as a trick. Any deaf person who felt a vibration of that vastness would probably have investigated, not ignored it. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are few issues that I would keep away from: the Holocaust is one; this is another. I wish these filmmakers had not been so arrogant (and inept).
