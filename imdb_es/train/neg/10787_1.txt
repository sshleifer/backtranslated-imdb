Let me put it another way: balls. Or, what about bun * ks. This is really horrible, more shameful than those you try to satirize. Julia Roberts is an expert actress, and generally her work is of the highest level. This film lacks guidance, even she strives to appear competent. Normally, she is an accomplished professional, but I swear there were signs of bewilderment and despair in her eyes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have rescued this movement was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken) Turning the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, that topic was not explored to its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was made of wood, Cusack was Cusack and Crystal should continue acting. The two ex-Buffy stars with talent had different experiences: hopeless green and Balfour's misuse. Well done to Julia to prevent this being the worst movie ever made.
