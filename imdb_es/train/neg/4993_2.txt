I went to see this movie waiting for an action movie of 'nothing really much', I was still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a bit of action with a comedy tinge. It keeps you hooked for the first half until you expect that now is the time for the action to begin. Well, none of that happens. The film is prolonged and the end knocks you down to a point where you get upset. What did the director think? It did not make sense at all. The film lacked all aspects, it did not have a real story and it seemed very hollow, even if "Rambo" was in it, I do not think it could have helped at all to the qualification. There is simply no logic in the movie. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating movie I've seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view after enduring it. Definitely not for people who have a little sense of cinema in them.
