Completely dreck. I arrived at 16 minutes / 27 second point, and I gave up. I would have given a negative review of the numbers if that were possible (although "pissible" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between the silly Dicky Crenna and the face here is simply non-existent. The ankle strap becomes an unattractive thick bracelet? Is not there a cigarette that lights up with the tips of your fingers? And I thought I would be sick when they look mortified (and, rightly, believe me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically belching through the explanation of his "little man" to Mr. Garloupis. It is not offensive to the blind, but it seems as if a group of blind people ran hallucinated with the design of the houses of Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for those horrible checkered pants Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much $$ earn Neff, who lives with a view to a huge marina? This, friends, again, everything happens in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can go through more, you have a constitution much stronger than me, or you are a masochist. But, please, take some Alka-Seltzer first, or you MUST develop a "little man" of your own that may never disappear. Proceed with caution, obviously.
