Words can not begin to describe how unusually terrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad that it's good", but it's not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only less charismatic person is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement about vanity, became the male protagonist. They both look like endogamy, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The girl, Sherry Thurig, is a spectator. Quite the opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and slender, and she can act. Although it can be said that he is being held. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the support man, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rainforest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly prevent his actors from acting? Is a director really that bad? Everyone else has perfectly summarized the story, there is not one. The children are kidnapped and Kelly rushes to solve the crime. I know how it felt to get into the poop, it's how I felt after watching your movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie that is better to let the friends of the director see (and if you look for them, you will see those same friends who gave the positive score to the movie).
