A bad attempt to scam "Seven", which is completed with a sub-second grade performance, a horrible job with the camera, a half story and a strong aftertaste of boring propaganda. Yes, they are "sex offenders", they live next door and they are really going to rape you. <br /> <br /> Without surprises of the vice-terminator's wife, she acts as always, as convincingly as a piece. of wood. Richard Gere keeps slipping lower and lower, and he's almost as low here as the late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The crazy-eyed singer is best when she's dead in bed; and even the wolf was below average (although she was the best performer in the movie), maybe they fed her before the shots, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which had an up, but interesting) story, with which one could relate more or less independently of the country, this film seems to focus on an exclusive obsession of EE. UU If one does not care about "sex offenders", and statistics indicate that lack of exercise and a bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death, there is little reason to see it or be afraid. <Br /> <br /> There are some body part fetishes and some tobacco, but the gore is less mediocre and fails both as an artistic device (because it does not make sense) and as a gore, because it is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
