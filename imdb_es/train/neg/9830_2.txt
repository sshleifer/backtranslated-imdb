I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rate this film as 10 are very Christian. I am not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good movie in general, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that the teaching of morality without teaching that Jesus was the basis of morality is wrong. One scene shows the main character telling a child that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us this. I find it offensive: should we believe that "you will not steal" came from Jesus? I guess he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stealing was acceptable before that? I rented the Netflix movie. I should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. Oh good.
