I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm pretty sure that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story on which it is based). Very similar argument, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that instead. <br /> <br /> This moves very slowly, but being a French film of the late 60s, that is what is expected of the style. Counted in retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls who revisits the school. The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little confusing at first, particularly because the audio of each overlay (that is, listening to flashbacks when viewing the present and vice versa). Also, the "girls" are a bit old to think they are in a boarding school. Finally, there is not much character development for you to get attached to the movie.
