I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority. I thought that the last one of Spike Lee is a bit boring! Although I was trying something different, that is, not only documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> It's really happening too much, Vinny (John Leguizamo) and the relationship of Dionna (Mira Sorvino), the lifestyle of Ritchie (Adrien Brody) and then the guys from the local mafia. The story is good, but in the end, that's all you have: 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, Mr. Lee could not have put more on that side of the movie? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points though. All the scenes with the "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz look very good (color saturation, etc.) and the acting is pretty good at everything. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that the different stories worked well on their own or without the murders. It just was not strong enough in the end. <br /> <br />
