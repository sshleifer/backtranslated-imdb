There is little to get excited about with "Dan in real life". First of all, the entire configuration is incredibly artificial. Did you really think that during that long first conversation in the restaurant, Marie would not have told Dan where he was going? And since Dan talked all the time during that conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? Actually, I never knew why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie. She is very narcissistic and recently to convince us that she really is a good guy (for example, she lies to Marie in the bookstore, she ridicules her brother for her past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a "blind date" ). There are more gadgets like that ridiculous scene in the bowling alley where the whole family catches Dan and Marie. Yes, that could really happen. Dan in real life is slow, dumb and manipulative. Even the movies of girls like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher ratings than this predictable "tearjerker".
