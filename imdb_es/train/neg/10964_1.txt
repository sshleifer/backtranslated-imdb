I was unlucky to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The sidewalk in general was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devoted fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice books, I was very excited about the release of this movie, which made it much more uncomfortable to watch. I'm usually enthusiastic about modern reps if they're treated well. In general, it is interesting to see the parallels between the past and the present in a family history. Unfortunately, this film was less a new modern version and more a perversion of pop culture. The adaptation of the characters in the original seemed youthful and usually turned out to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most of the performances were ridiculously exaggerated, which I suppose was due to a bad direction or an effort to compensate for a bad script. I did not laugh once during the duration of the movie. All the jokes were obsolete references to events not so current that will surely lose their value as time passes. Actually, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on its way to meet Alice, but even at that moment it was a bad imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I must say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance was horrible. It was without a doubt the lowest point of the movie. <br /> <br /> What a joke. I do not see this movie. After his conclusion, he was really angry.
