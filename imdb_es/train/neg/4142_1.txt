This is the worst movie I've seen in my life! There was nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no plot and most of the movie is moving fast to make it faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can not seriously think that someone thought of this movie and is watching it. I am sorry for anyone who has to sit down during this painful hour and a half. Please, follow my advice and DO NOT LOOK at this movie because I know you'll think it's the biggest waste of time you've ever spent in your life.
