"Magnolia" is a showcase of disconcerting and absurd performance that adds very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a series of episodes without objective, without any concern for consistency. The camera rushes down corridors and corridors, glimpsing sad characters. Where is the reason for caring for these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who can not care about others (except the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and are self-destructive idiots who are falling apart or dying. I remembered how much I did not like "Shine" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive and unattractive characters here, why would we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said that, there is nothing withheld about "Magnolia". The ideas of Paul Thomas Anderson are dotted on his canvas with abandon. There are two particular ideas that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One has the camera going from one character to another, while each one sings one of the popular songs of Aimee Mann's cafeteria. Sweet, but ineffective since we can not see what unites them all. The other idea to which I refer can not be revealed except to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a great performance. In particular, Tom Cruise, who triggers a performance he did not know he had in him. And John C. Reilly is perhaps the most decent and truly good policeman in recent memory. But everything adds up to nothing. When the unexpected secret event occurred, a girl behind me in the theater could not take it anymore and said: "This is stupid!" My feeling is that most viewers will agree.
