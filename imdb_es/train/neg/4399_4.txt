['&quot;Tapeheads,&quot; a scary, intermittently funny parody of the music video business, could have been the perfect comedy short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins find themselves effortlessly in the chaos of the meaningless mayhem involved. They play two semi-knowledgeable security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making fun videos for groups, parties and a deathbed star. It&#39;s a pity that the filmmakers have had to invent a tenuous side script to control the execution time (scams involving a crooked politician and his henchmen, who do not do much more than remove the main force of the film, sending the musical culture of the late 80&#39;s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerds but loose, ready for the street without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same wavelength, and they never go down. They are the real thing in friends&#39; comedies. * 1/2 of ****']
