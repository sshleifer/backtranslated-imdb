There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to spoil. Madchen Amick is the living proof that a face can earn a living by acting, no talent is required. The only bright spot are a few really good delivered by Alice Krige, but, again, she IS Alice Krige. His soft dreamy voice gives the only clue to how seductively dangerous these strange creatures can be. She is incredibly creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they managed to get her to accept this project remains a mystery. The writers must have been medicated when they presented this script. It has great problems of continuity, superficial stereotyped characters, writing of horror formulas and simply does not make any sense. The creatures, although they have clear abilities like becoming "tenuous", the question of where they come from and what they are is never explored that much. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
