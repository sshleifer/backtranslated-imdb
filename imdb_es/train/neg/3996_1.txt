I do not see what everyone liked about this movie. The configuration was too long and complicated, and when it was over, the main character remained as flat and opaque as it had been in the first scene. After the film finally took Cusack to the hotel room of the same name, I had to ask myself, well, what will happen here during the next hour to keep me engaged. The answer: Not much, only John Cusack suffered a long and prolonged mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the character of Cusack had more depth. . Maybe if your freak out was a more complete review of your daily life. . . maybe if the film had better developed its half-hearted issues about loss and faith or not addressed them in the first place. . . Maybe if the movie had chosen to be a psychological horror or a terror of emotion and had completely embraced one of these styles. . . I dont know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror fans and none of us really liked it. <br /> <br /> Except for the disturbing episode on the cornice of the hotel, the alarming madwoman with the hammer, and the stupid one who was funny guardian of crypts in the air duct, the three of which do not represent More than five minutes of screen time, this movie was boring. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here with a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
