The film had great potential, unfortunately, it disintegrated due to a weak / implausible story line, a reading error and a general lack of content / substance. One of the most obvious faults was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem like a small flaw, but it points to the apparent lack of effort to pay attention to details. The quality of the performance was uniformly well below average. <br /> <br /> The lonely salvation of the movie was the twist in the plot at the end; and a French song (I do not remember the title). In general, it was a pretty bad movie in which Sean Connery was visibly out of place.
