# 1 Vampires against humans <br /> <br /> # 2 Militaries reject scandal squads as first responders of raids by dangerous and unknown vampires. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy vampire on the side of "good guys". <br /> <br /> # 4 A lot of blood and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) main plot devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device may not deter you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In outer space. <br /> <br /> The last one almost also caught me, but I'm glad I saw it. In a lot of horror to direct video, is the Halloween marathon of the science fiction channel ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will face any of the other offers of the science fiction channel, and even against the other Vampire movie in which Natassia participated (who still gives money to Uwe Boll?).
