It was 9:30 PM the night before in my friend's trailer and we were so excited to see South Park (a new episode). The point is that, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time watching the program that is broadcast now, Father of Pride. I'll start by saying that I've only seen episodes. The first time I saw it, I found it ungraceful and raw at all, so I thought "Holy Sh * t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop seeing the stupid cartoons". But yesterday I tried to give the father of pride a second chance. I think it's a complete robbery of The Simpsons, which instead replaces the yellow human characters with lions instead. <br /> <br /> The second thing is that I wonder why he got his TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this program are some homosexual jokes (without grace). The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and raw. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he stayed too much in the family theme. However, I must admit that the Father of Pride made me smile (he even laughed once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not care about the Father of Pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I've seen much better from '' The Simpsons ''. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
