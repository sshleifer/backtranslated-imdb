"Witchery" could be the most incoherent horror film with the most scripts of the 80s, but, fortunately, it has some compensating qualities, like fantastic bloody effects, an exciting musical score and some fantastic casting options. Honestly, the script does not have an ounce of meaning, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an explosive hairstyle) portrays another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof represents a cunning photographer (who can not seem to lie down) in a film that constantly presents voodoo with blood, stitched lips, upside-down crucifixions, vicious burns and a melody used in excess but genuinely spooky. Eight people randomly gather on an abandoned tourist island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the dark history of the place; The dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, although no one seems to care about who the father is and what is their whereabouts), considers the possibility of reopening the hotel and the architect yigua simply joined for casual sex. Are they forced to spend the night in the ramshackle hotel and then, suddenly, the previous owner? An aging actress or something that always dresses in black? start to take them out in several fascinating ways. Everything is related in some way to the introduction sequence that shows a woman accused of witchcraft jumping out the window. Anyway, the plot is definitely minor in an Italian horror franchise that began as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead." The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There is something extremely morbid and disturbing about looking at a defenseless woman hanging upside down from a fireplace and waiting for them to fry.
