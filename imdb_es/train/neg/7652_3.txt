In 1967, the mining workers found the remains of an ancient disappeared civilization called Abkani who believe that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the door between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad happened before the door was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the 713 Office of the Government's Paranormal Investigation Agency was headed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who conducted experiments with orphaned children. Currently, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just obtained an Abkani artifact in South America, and is being chased by a man with skills. When an old friend of the foster home disappears in the middle of the night, it reveals that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the 713 Office, commander. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, fight against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite having a charismatic cast, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works and is a complete disaster, with no character development or plot. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that "video games are the best sellers of younger generations that are no longer handled by books." In addition, its target audience would be people between twelve and twenty-five years old. I'm sorry, but I find both statements disrespectful to younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that kind of stupid stereotype, says the director. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics to prove that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark" or "Awakening of the Evil" ("Alone in the Dark")
