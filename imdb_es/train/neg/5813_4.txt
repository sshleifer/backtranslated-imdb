Tierney is a real tough guy, but this film fails to RKO normally competent undermines its impact at all times. The script is as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Commandment dinner. Only counts the times that the incredible Tierney carmates swallow an unconvincing excuse after another for their evasive and violent acts. The old clich√© about this "only happens in the movies" applies here in full. Then there's the guy who plays the watchman, who seems to have entered a WC Fields comedy, ruining the threatening mood in the process. The static sets of a room do not help either, nor does the obvious lack of perception of the material by director Feist. Then, add a final chase in the car that is missing both the imagination and the reward, and the results are quite flat. In fact, the film only appears in the scenes of the police station where bitten policemen discover the hidden powers of the employees of an innocent-looking gas station. Too bad that the career of Tieney has never faced. I guess this was due in large part to being such a strong guy off the screen as in a bad quality fight after another. His icy way and his clarity of emotion sometimes remind me of Lee Marvin at his best. Anyway, this project could have worked like a radio play, but like a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
