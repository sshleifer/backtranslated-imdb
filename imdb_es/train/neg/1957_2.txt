I was enjoying this movie most of the time, but I still had the feeling that I was watching a movie for children. Honestly, I think someone wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add some blood, nudity and language. It was a big disappointment. You have to believe the magic of children that exists in movies like "babe" (the pig) or "angels in the gardens" that defeat the fairy with the evil teeth. parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and use this ability to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a B movie response to the terrible darkness that falls; Somehow they manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not. they made a worse movie and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost in the dark.
