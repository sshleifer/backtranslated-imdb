I had to leave the theater. After an hour, all I was seeing were people cheating on wives, sucking like dogs in a routine and using the word f as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No, thanks. <br /> <br /> It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any of the characters could have been quite interesting if they had been given more to do than to fornicate, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> The few times it seemed like they were about to do it. Being some kind of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. The development of the plot in the first hour can be summarized as 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the scene of the murder 3) Vinnie looks grumpily across the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on his wife, and 5 ) Joey (the most sympathetic character in The Show) is expelled from his parents' house. More than that, I did not wait to see. <br /> <br /> The photography and the interaction between the characters were excellent, but THERE WAS NOTHING for what they DID. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in the community and interpersonal relationships.
