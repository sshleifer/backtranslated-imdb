What a horrible sight. Sci-fi fans seem to look at anything more regardless of quality. I'm surprised that something exceptional like Firefly lasts a season, while garbage like the new version of Battlestar Galactica generates a spin off. This spin off is unfortunate in all aspects of the show. The acting is youthful and without inspiration. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has been in a bad science fiction series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a prime-time telenovela. The management is of poor quality and the sets are horrible. Caprica is a movie loss, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is a spin off that should never have been done.
