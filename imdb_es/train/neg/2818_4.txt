Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocrite and archeologist father of bible (William Finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays Sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. Genie is led astray by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who travels naked on a horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to smoking opium, which leads to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman that simulates oral sex. about a snake, an orgy and his father preaching in the background! Meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, tear eyeballs and cut throats. When Genie ingests drugs in his tea, he imagines Sade hanging from a cross, a woman painted gold with a leafy string and her bloodied in a bed covered with snakes. Everything is because she is the reincarnation of De Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This production of Harry Alan Towers, normally sordid, is redundant, seedy and quite foolish, but the scenarios, the costumes, the cinematography and the location work are excellent. At least, there is always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 of 10
