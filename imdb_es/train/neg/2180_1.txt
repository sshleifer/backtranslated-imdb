Where to start, there are so many wrong and horrible things about this movie that I'm not sure where to start. Well, the two puppets that wrote this shit. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first, could not invent their supposed minds by a name. I guess they divided the difference, that's why the main title is "THE BRAIN THAT DID NOT WANT TO DIE", but the final screen says "HEAD THAT DOES NOT WANT TO DIE". Neither of you knows anything about the medical profession. After all, doctors swear "do no harm." Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harm". Also, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. The rejection would mean death for Jan in the pan. Also, it keeps a monster work patch. From what medical school did Bill graduate from FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIFIC TECH? The monster did not have a name, that bothers me a lot. Also, does brilliant surgeon Dr. Bill Cortner not know how to keep a patient sedated? Everything and everything a disaster of a movie, is incredibly stupid and can not be seen, except in MST3K. I give you THE TURKEY OF THANKS.
