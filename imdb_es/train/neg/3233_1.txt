Come on people, can not be serious, another case of tobacco advertising when it is not! This is not remotely scary or scary or depraved, it's just an extremely terrible amateur videowork, made for the next party to throw the girls away. <br /> <br /> The gore is incredibly bad, even the eye-scene is far from making me want to vomit, but it just makes me want to take the camera and hit those guys in the head. The girl is lying with the rubber face, not moving at all. It would have been more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" It is more frightening than this. Do not waste your time or your money.
