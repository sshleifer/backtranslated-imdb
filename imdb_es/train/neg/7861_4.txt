The premise of this long awaited sequel was really good and after the great success of the new version I sincerely hoped. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. The situations are silly and they are beyond reason and the acting is really horrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no nice characters or violins unlike the remake. Also, the gore is not so abundant and when it happens it is really bad. <br /> <br /> The violence is minimal and it is a pity because there are many arguments that make you think that there is room for violent violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibalistic mutants. Surely you expect something different! When I saw it in the movies, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a clear example of how hasty movies become a disaster and show poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A disaster that disappointed fans of the new version like me. That's why sequels are never welcome; At least this movie is not as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
