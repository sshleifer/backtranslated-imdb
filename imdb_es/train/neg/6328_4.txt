Why does this film fall well below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor and humorless script. A thin / medium looking Travolta (with a rather handsome look in black, I must say, even with a HUGE red mullet) and Gross, act very well as two young 'dresses' but in spite of everything, New Yorkers eager to open your own nightclub. Apart from that, the rest of the movie is simply boring to watch. It's SO boring that it really is not worth knowing what happens at the climax of the movie at any level. Kelly Preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sex-laden dance with her future husband, Travolta, is one of the few pleasures of the movie. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as the KGB fighter "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot was modified a bit so that the configuration would not change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (what's in the former Soviet Union?). You see the movie ... Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for release in 1987. I guess Paramount got stuck in releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the incredible plot. It was reported that they considered it "inescapable". However, this $ 6,000,000 movie earned a little over $ 163,000 in shameful income as BRIEFLY was released in places like Texas and Colorado before going directly to the video. This is a testament to the general poor quality of this movie.
