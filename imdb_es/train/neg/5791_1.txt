As a native film teacher, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst movies with native content I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes, the non-creative attempts to use parts of the stories of traditional coyotes and the bad work of the camera only worsened due to the unintuitive story line and the bad script. The writer and the director have shown the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying natives and communities. If this person is native, you should go home and apologize to everyone you know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and the bad sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is not a native, you should seriously reexamine your white privilege and ask yourself if you are showing an untested, unintentional racism, or if you are being intentionally ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors of this movie have had a good time and at least paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native movies, check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
