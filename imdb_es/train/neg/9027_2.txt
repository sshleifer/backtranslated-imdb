Revenge over us the audience that looks maybe. I sat through this 2-hour movie and was waiting for the second act so that the film would live up to its title. But Costner never comes the fate of her lovers: she dies and the movie ends. I kept wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge, it's better for the hero to get something at the end of the movie. I had the option to see this or Black Rain at the movies. Fortunately, I saw the movie of the other brothers in the cinema. I caught up with this turkey on video. There was something good in the movie and it was his beautiful themed melody. Listen to the CD Do not look at this, it's horrible. 1 out of 10
