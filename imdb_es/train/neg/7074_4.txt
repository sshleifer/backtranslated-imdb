My God, this movie is very boring. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie I was expecting a romantic drama and a great performance by Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija's characters is very unconvincing. And I absolutely hated the character of Serbedzija (a wonman organizer), he is not charming in any way in the movie. How Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job in this role, but I guess they do not look European. Anyway, I was so bored with drilling the movie. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound, your best movie so far. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some films by Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so underestimated, and deserves more opportunities than this, I want her to make a better choice in the future.
