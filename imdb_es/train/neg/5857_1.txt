WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it did not follow the example of most of the previous Survivor Series. There was only one game in the series of survivors. And that Survivor Series match lasted 45 minutes. Also, anyone with a functional brain would know that it would end with The Rock against Austin and The Rock prevailing for their team. And do not make me start with the preview before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to die. There was no need for all that nonsensical hype. Whatever the story, it was just a fight event. <br /> <br /> And as for the rest of the matches: the first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast-paced match and it is good to see a heel win a match fairly. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and we have seen it 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus Test was good, but nothing great. The title of the steel cage label was the best match of the night. The Royal battle continued for 10 minutes and nobody cared who would win in the first place. The match for the women's title was not great. No, not in the least. The main event must have been the most hypocritical party in history. The Alliance lost, but guess what, after 5 months, all the Alliance superstars returned. The party itself was poor. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. The Rock was too caught up in their performance to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who put the entire game in danger. If I wanted any 2 to be eliminated at the beginning, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were autumn guys. 7 matches is not enough for a series of survivors. If there's ever a Survivor Series as bad as this one again, I'm going to
