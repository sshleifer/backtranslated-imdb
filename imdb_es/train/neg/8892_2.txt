Admittedly, this version dishonors Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet had good skills as a teenager, but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we can never really connect with her. She is worse off making the scene when she is thinking about drinking the sleeping potion ... God stop whining! I would have poured it into her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews ... Oh! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), it is quite shocking in this one. And do not make me start with Romeo ... Puhleasssssee! It is still good to see if you are in the quest to see every Romeo and Juliet sometime in the history of cinema. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard and then the current Leo and Clare!
