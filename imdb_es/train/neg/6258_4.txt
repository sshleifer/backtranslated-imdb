Writer and director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a heterosexual man, recently widowed, who learned that in the last three weeks he is HIV positive; he traces the only homosexual companion he ever had, takes him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the man and promising a bloody revenge if the results are positive. The intriguing idea sounds better in the role of what is reproduced. The captive of James Marsden is a cynical and petty realist, but the actor's own artificial gestures are disconcerting, like watching a version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the most challenging role, but his personality change from shy to kidnapper is not convincing, and neither are the conversations the two men have. Marsden's gay party guy is not apathetic, of course, momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's situation, but he does not react or behave as a homosexual man would in this circumstance. The film is not a copy, exactly, but it is a fraud, further damaged by poor editing, poorly conceived flashbacks, low-budget production and the grand finale that smells like silly pretense and soapy melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
