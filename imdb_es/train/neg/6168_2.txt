Hmm, Rating of IMDb of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... well, two of my friends and I, we ordered Pizza, we sat down and we wanted to see something as great as Ichi or at least something brainless but fun as Versus. But the naked blood sucked. It is a complete waste. Well, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite exceptional. But that's it. Nothing more and nothing less. I will not summarize the plot, other people already did it, I just wanted to stop the hype. But look at it and rate it for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it should be. One more thing that comes to mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter's: well, John is great ... :) 2/10
