I think they really let the quality of DVD production escape them. I rented this DVD at 2 movie stores and the second time I finally put it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is very difficult to give the film an unbiased review after going through an inconvenience to interpret it. On the one hand, I had never seen a Finnish horror movie before, so I was a bit disappointed that the film was done in English. In addition, since it has never been clarified what is happening to Sarah, she was left behind and, therefore, really expected someone to shoot her in the face and eliminate all the horrible events.
