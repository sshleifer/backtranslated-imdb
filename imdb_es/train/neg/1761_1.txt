First of all, I realize that a rating of "1" is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets that from me because, as one critic points out, it is not bad in a conscious and exaggerated way that could allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply loses its mark on each account. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely false. The continuity is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel has just spoken about his lost love, and with his last word the flamenco dancers begin. The simulacrum of his name (see? I do not even remember the name of his character, much less the name of the forgetful actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) tells her for the first time that her friend is the bad one. The car and the motorcycle chases did everything right. The vegetables carts have gone flying. Cars colliding with each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People are almost beaten, but remarkably, nobody is. Oh, that's right ... except for the one who has been stabbed several times, obviously he's stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and apparently an approaching car did not notice it there. Hmmm <br /> <br /> It is increasingly noticeable to me that films like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, one would think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good movies worth watching. Now there is a novel idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not watch this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Do not look at it by cable. There are many other things you could be doing that will make you feel more satisfied.
