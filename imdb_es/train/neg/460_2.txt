I was required to see the film for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, they paid me), but I still found that the movie stinks much more than the average. The jokes were boring, the two leading actresses ... well, to use the Hollywood women's division of "The First Friends" in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "good girl" age, but more in their age than " district attorney ". What most angered me about the movie was the main plot, which practically completely plagiarized "Beavis and Butthead Do America" ​​(in which all the boys were enthusiastic about a guy who offered them money to "make his wife", without realizing that she is expected to kill her). In general, a piece of bland garbage.
