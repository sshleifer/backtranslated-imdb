Whoever wrote the two or three enthusiastic reviews was involved in the making of this film, the term was used lightly, or the bank rolled it, and if the latter was the case, I would like to get my seven dollars back ! The actors, once again the term used lightly, are terrible, in fact, almost none of them ever did anything, which is a relief. The stage and everything related to these screams, we had 7 dollars to work and one day to do it. Was it filmed in someone's backyard? Everything about this project says, under budget. The actors in the best case were the D list. Do not waste your time, unless, of course, you want to recover it and try to recover the rent. The bad boy who leads looks like the punk of the show of the 70 who ended up marrying his grandmother Dummee Moore. My local box office video store shows this as the most returned movie with sad comments attached. Even as a rent of 99 cents this film accumulates dust. Someone really should owe some favors. This is a super smelly and I give him 10 turds.
