There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you away from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is horrible, the script serious; and the overrated special effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat its audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?
