If you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching this, it depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them so damn terrible they're hysterical, be careful. Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and I say it as a fan of the low budget horror / gore genre and have seen a few to compare it with. I'm not even going to go into the details of what makes this movie so bad as it is, the only good thing about it is that it's so terrible that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find this for cheap rent, it's definitely worth seeing, if you were involved in doing it, it's a shame for you. : o) IMDb must enter a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it deserves it.
