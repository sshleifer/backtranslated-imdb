The cast of this film contains some of the best actors in New Zealand, many of which I have seen in fabulous roles, however, this film fills me with shame to be from the same country as them. False American accents are the first clue that things are going to go spectacularly wrong. As another critic noted astutely, the luxury cruise is, in fact, an old car ferry, decorated with some of the multicolored flags stolen from a used car lot. The majority of the cast seems to be from the great New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie had been dreamed of at a Christmas party by the cast of Shortland Street, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine that "Under Siege" meets "The Love Boat", organized by your local elementary school and run by an autistic and comes up with the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend you watch this movie. As a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
