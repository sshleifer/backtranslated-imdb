Probably encouraged by fans of her much better "Orlando", Potter here delivers a vehicle for her in the worst way: writes, directs, stars and actually co-writes music, including a mawkish love song. The film is very similar to a high school or college project of a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is so unfriendly that the object of his romantic obsession is unpleasant, and the whole movie is an embarrassing show of narcissism disguised as a celebration of tango. Maybe if she had not cast herself, it might have worked. She simply can not act, whether playing herself or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, bored and stupid.
