The justifications for what happened to your film in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists who do script rewrites aside, let's take this film as it is offered, without bizarre explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. Straight up craptastic. Instead of repeating what can serve as an argument, I will review some curious points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (of 5) will take a field trip to a history class in the middle of bitch Ireland. These students can be Canadian or American, it's hard to say. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest instead of Ireland is also quite obvious. A student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the "dumb" character in a series of 80s movies, except when he channels Randy from Scream. A character can be Chris Klein's double. He has a girlfriend who probably dies, but he's never really established if that's true. A character is sullen and eliminated from his colleagues ... only ... because ... and then there is a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "sir" more than once. He is very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a battered porn star with the worst Irish accent in his life and most likely beyond. <br /> <br /> Picturesque Ireland has many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once. Cut scenes <br /> <br /> The producers obtained a discount in the volume of the false entrails. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unknowingly, horribly bred monsters have access to the new hunting knives. Maybe there is some kind of outdoor activity store nearby with a blind and deaf employee who works in the registry. <br /> <br /> Also without my knowing it, if it straightens up for approximately 600 years, as the story tells us, we believe it happened. being something lumpy, but surprisingly elegant and quite strong. Genetics is a wonderful game of dice. <br /> <br /> There may or may not be more than one phenomenon in this movie. They refer to "them" and we see shadows, but only a strange-looking guy is seen. And when a strange looking guy finally dies, apparently all danger passes. I'm running with my initial guess that nobody thought of dressing a second man with full makeup, so they only used the one. That's what it looks like on the screen, anyway. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that, apart from those new and gleaming knives, innate fans have access to some elegant leather equipment, because once Richard Grieco cuts his ties, there are new lists for him. next sprout that is tied ... that also escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to simply undo them, so one wonders why even bother to tie someone. <br /> <br /> A corpse in a hut will be loaded with worms after what I guess it has been about 2 hours. Said dead body will also have glasses on when no character uses them. Curious <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from the stage to the left, chats for 2 minutes, disappears from the stage to the left. In the middle of a giant forest. That's not unusual, since Gary can also come out of nowhere, which is also known as everything that exists on television that comes out of the screen. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Jameson dies sadly and, somehow, her clothes fade away as my hope that this movie does not turn off the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special nod to the character "Breeder", the poor girl who has been used by monsters for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has shadow and emotes in the camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was clearly added by a drunk or someone with a fierce mentality. Disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with the excessive consumption of gasoline over the years. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was not just random garbage that I found in the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard about this and even followed it. Film through its production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing else to say. May God have mercy on all of us.
