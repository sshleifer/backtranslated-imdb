Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match that represents very different brothers, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or substantial to his role. Leigh, who plays the singer of the band of bars and the alcoholic Sadie Flood, is constantly supported by the older sister, Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the mold of Joni Mitchell. Perhaps due to her double tasks as a co-producer in the film, Leigh seems to have locked herself in a corner: she is not credible as a singer and, although this is intentional, she gives herself too much time on screen in the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour de force, Leigh is tired and nervous; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that take us away from her). If Sadie had the slightest charisma or appeal, we could accept the concept that she gets the (small) breaks she has. As it stands, the likelihood of her taking the stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard creates a few intense dramatic sequences, and the final edition juxtaposes Sadie's performance at the bar with the Georgia sand show, both singing the same song, and it's a sadly nuanced moment ... but in reality, what is the moment? point? * 1/2 of ****
