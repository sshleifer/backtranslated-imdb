Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgue ... come on!). The acting is ... well, there's no acting! <br /> <br /> There's a guy who really goes to the forest to look for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat clown who can not beat a turtle! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the cast members are stupid and the director puts all the clich√©s of slasher movies into the movie effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The ending is so far the stupidest ever made. Think about it: the guy (ken hebert) who has the ability to act is almost the same as his writing (he is the mastermind behind this failure), invites a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the weekend and kill them. .. On Monday morning he returns to his office as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert tries to make us believe that it is a family affair that continues for a generation (his uncle is the clown killer) <br /> <br /> So, Of course, NO policeman will interrogate him after his co-worker is lost ... <br /> <br /> ANY. <br /> <br />
