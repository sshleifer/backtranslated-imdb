This movie is a giant load of pants. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad script. And his address is as comatose as it can be without actually being sleepwalked during the process. <br /> <br /> However, the worst thing is Woody Harrelson, who I usually like when he's chosen correctly. He plays "The Walker," a homosexual man in DC who plays as a social partner of the boring wives of Washington's elite. It could not have been more one-dimensional if it had been cut from a magazine and bounced in front of the camera on an ice cream stick. His "southern accent" is the "off the rack" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of each line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the south still exhaust him from every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But, his is not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to affect a kind of Middle Eastern accent that is so clumsy that he can hardly pronounce the bad lines written for him. He is unable to roll his r even though in real life he is German and speaks several languages, one of them is Italian! That's a good reason to choose someone else, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From the story, to the script, the direction, the camera work, the performances of the protagonists, this film is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to leave this film with their dignity intact. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being stuck in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could be good enough to redeem this endless series of failures. If you like these three actresses, look at them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
