The early '80s of Richard Pryor running down the street in a fire incident must have affected him in some way. In his stand up, he jokes about having big laughs. He seemed to have done something related to the projects he chose. The Toy is about what you never chose, other than I guess someone else. <br /> <br /> A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? A bit of underlying political incorrectness before you was such a thing. It is seeing Richard getting all sentimental what finally made me leave before the end. I wanted to see Pryor match up with this brat, instead he becomes the misunderstood nauseum for the kids! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his 70s stuff. This is a waste of time for any moviegoer!
