The former private security guard gets rid of his last droneing job and is immediately offered the opportunity to return to his previous profession. His mission: to follow a mysterious French woman recently arrived in California ... and apparently wanted by criminals in suits and ties. Unsuccessful attempt to update the genre of film noir, without enough sting or wit (or involving argument dynamics) in the script. The director and co-journalist Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the image was edited without his participation) does not give the impression of having great respect for the films of the 1940s from which his "Chandler" was born; His nostalgia is appropriately wrinkled, but also bitter and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curious, commendable, discreet, and Warren Oates is well founded as this variant of the 70s in the archetype of "private cock", but the film has no effect. It's nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast, though neither has much to do, and the character of Caron running through the heat and cold is exasperating. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, a good filming location, but it does not come to a boil. * 1/2 of ****
