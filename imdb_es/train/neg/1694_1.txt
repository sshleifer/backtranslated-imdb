This movie may seem scary in the ads, but the movie itself was a reason to throw up. This is below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and safe, a dead Japanese woman would scare you, but so what? Make a movie that attracts viewers and not only shows images of frightened people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "horrible scam of Samara (The Ring)"? Do not make me start with the "dead child." Not even that fear! And that? He has a cat and can imitate him, great business! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be harmed by rancor! 1/10! How disgusting <
