I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with many of the things that Bush has done in office. And I love the daily program and the Colbert report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on television. I enjoy the jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy who has ever walked the earth (I think he's not the dumbest either). But there comes a time when enough is enough and it is actually not so funny anymore. I see where it can be fun and it is (hey, he's making fun of our authority figure, it's hilarious). However, the center of comedy is just trying to make fun of him. I mean, maybe a special episode, but a whole series is just dumb. It seems that CC is only saying the same jokes that we have heard many times. I really can not see this show beyond 1 season.
