There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are pretty funny. "Criminally crazy 1" was one of those movies. So bad that it was nice and had a re-watch value. "Criminally Insane 2" has to be one of the worst movies ever made, and that tells me a lot because I'm not the kind of person who says the worst is the worst. But trust me, this was completely horrible and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The movie has a rather incoherent story, but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a big Fat woman running around killing people because she is not being fed. Well, you do not see that in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences that are from the first one. The new story could have been really fun with sending Ethel to a shelter and killing everyone, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and by that time you're falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this movie is simply atrocious. This reminds me, literally, of something I shot with my friends when I was 15 years old. The quality of the sound is something else, since you can not understand a word that most of the characters are saying. To give an example of how bad it is, go to a New York subway and try to understand what is being said on the speakers, that's how this movie sounds. It does not matter what they're talking about anyway because the actors are as dry as a piece of dead wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying this is the worst movie is pretty tough, but the words can not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, I watch over you. 1/10
