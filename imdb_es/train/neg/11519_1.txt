This is absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a splendid cast. That is James Cromwell as the delegate of the ignorant. I could go on and on, but obviously I would be spending more time on this review than anyone else in the script. The only thing this film is about is about us against them and how to delight with a profane slap that overcomes the tolerance of any reasonable human being. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've seen, and I LOVE James Garner.
