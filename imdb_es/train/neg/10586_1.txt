This is a well-made informative movie in the PBS Frontline line. The problem is that Frontline already made this article and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. More worrying is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson, a former wonk think tank, was a supporter of the war until the occupation went south. What did you think was going to happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland was also very good until it was spoiled by those annoying Nazis. And that's how this film feels: an apology for the occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself. . <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been carried out better, as if any war could be better.
