Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 The son of Amitabh, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for over 33 years ... he <br /> <br /> A Telepathically transmitted the sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) Did you ask a good Pakistani guard to send it by mail? <br /> <br /> C) They allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers were having too much bhang in <br /> > <br /> at the moment they approved the script? <br /> <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) loves Khanna - he's yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently he loves her - who does not, right ?! ... But, when his father is surprised, and then killed (I almost do not think this is a 'spoiler', since you would have to be brain dead and blind to not see this in the movie) he is quite excited towards this catastrophe and with the tip (metaphorically) of his hat, leaves it behind to save his father, no matter his loss, and says (paraphrasing) "If God wants it, we will meet again" ... Basically it means "I will to get you a D My job done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- calluses that go beyond Hollywood standards of low life ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called film, you can drive all the jeeps, trucks, camels and anything else that goes through it. Pass - really, completely and totally waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, just one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of the quality) a great belly dance - but it's NOT worth watching just for this. <br /> <br /> Rent to Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (Hrithik Roshan will ever take acting classes?) for best Indo-Pak conflict films ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is very good. 7.5 / 8 I would say!
