There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any prize. Well, it does not deserve a hearing either. Ironically, one of the prizes is for cinematography but, frankly, the movements of the camera are disconcerting, to say the least. Each frame, you feel you are getting the "full picture", it is as if someone is "trimming your eyes" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not stand watching the whole movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers party in their barracks and one of the soldiers persuaded to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me a lot of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice, stay away from this garbage.
