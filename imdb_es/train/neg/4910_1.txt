The word "1st" in the title has a more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its victims of crime. At least they do not have to stay and see how this endless film comes to its own demise. <br /> <br /> The first should refer to: the first draft of a script; The first shots used in each performance in the final film; 1st edition in post production; etcetera etcetera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not too bad, it's just that everything about the movie is worse than the third class, from the ridiculous script to the wooden performances. And while you suffer through this improvised film, for the 2 hour mark you want to be taken out of your misery. With 160 minutes of duration, it is evident that it should have been edited in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> When entering into details related to the lame and act script, it has few purposes. Even in the equally horrible, Lake Placid, at least the performances that Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from an extremely weak script, were sufficiently nuanced to make you laugh at the movie. In 1st to Die, one ends up suffering only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the initial scene of the suicide preparation of the female protagonist. <br /> <br /> The edition is so bad that one was never presented. to one of the main characters, which I think (they were never told at all) is a DA She only appears in a scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene in which the viewer is presented was dropped on the floor of the editor. And nobody noticed that a character that appeared out of nowhere was an unusual movie trick. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we would not do it. But at least we created our own diversions by commenting on several places in the movie as if it were Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
