Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he makes after "Crimson Tide" seems to take it one step closer to being the worst job of today (Michael Bay may fall in the same category, but at least it's his great movie). The mute and delirious epics are entertained on a primordially evil level. And like other exaggerated Hollywood biopics ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", for example) that relate the lives of pretentious, overrated or simply superficial ciphers, which receive an aura of "mysticism" on the part of From a prosperous society Juicy details behind the scenes, "Domino" is a film that starts with little potential, and reaches that infinitesimal amount before the sixty minute mark. With a run time of 128 minutes already relaxed, the film has twice as much time, and spend time with characters so unpleasantly superficial and forgettable (unlike the higher "Rules of Attraction", Scott's attempts to qualify the procedures with irony through Domino's presumption, the voice-over of a rich and self-conscious girl only draws attention to the lack of idea of ​​the movie's hammer) becomes an act that only masochists can find pleasurable. The history? Domino Harvey, a spoiled girl from the upper crust (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her beautiful appearance) is fed up with the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and harasses bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramírez to learn a more exciting trade; Along the way, there are double crosses, shootings, media attention (courtesy of an ironic Christopher Walken, telephoning on his trademark sleazebag), and laughter suggestive of romance. Scott cuts the movie into segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, increasing the resolution to make the movie a nightmare full of neon that is downright unpleasant to watch, if Scott has a chance to frame a shaky, ghostly image, or distort it in some way, it will; but all this stressful stylistic overload overwhelms the little plot, characterization and suspense that the film has (to say nothing of its, ehm, value of "entertainment"). Most of the characters appear as despicable or stereotyped, often both (notice the unbearable segment of several minutes where an African-American presents a new list of racial categorizations in "Jerry Springer"), and I found myself wishing that everyone get the ending of " Tails "of the coin of our protagonist for the end. "Domino" is an absolute rubbish, not mitigated: whatever interest Scott has wanted to inspire in his audience, he will be lost in a sea of ​​neon pretensions that cause migraines in a few minutes.
