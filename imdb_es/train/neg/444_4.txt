(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi era. But it's too long, it's not moving and even boring! There are too many clichés and there is not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> The storyline is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. That there is another woman introduced who does the same. Confused is that both are remembering events from other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic narrative ... How can Riemann know about the fate of the girl's mother and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> The scenes are displayed in the wrong order and we rarely know when they took place. For example, the scene in which Riemann proposes marriage to Fabian. When I pass that? The scene seems to be set in the 1920s ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, well, she's even a baroness! Wow. His brother returns from the eastern front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" that he is showing in some scenes. Then he is a war hero and even a good man who kept his conscience. And he gained knowledge of the massacres committed by the Germans. He even made some pictures! And so it goes, cliché after cliché is accumulating and this is the reason why the film does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trotta made a girl movie that could have been a decent movie. And in the end everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels to bed and ... ta da! - Everyone is free. What is not a historical fact but a pure imagination despite the affirmation of "real history" at the beginning. Like "Sass", it is based loosely on a real event. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, this is the typical German movie these days. It is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
