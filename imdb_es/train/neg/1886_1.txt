Once I promised that I would never get out of any movie (a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different types of dreck, like Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact), but Mr. Seidl almost did it. Hundstage was a truly horrible experience. Anyone who watches this film will think that the Austrians are a miserable and pathetic group of delays. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humiliate each other just for one reason: to distract themselves from their own miserable existence. By choosing a style similar to that of a documentary with non-professional actors (most of them seem taken from the imagination of the Austrian dramatist Deix), the director Seidl wants us to believe that this is real life in the Austrian suburbs (European, Western , Western)? . The viewer faces representations of sexual orgies, violence against women and disabled people, insanity and degradation. But this is not social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you have bad acting, bad cinematography, bad movies. If someone needs a movie like this to realize that there are bad things in our society, this person must have traveled life with their eyes closed. This is a pseudo-social criticism with a hammer. And he despises people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people, that's not the reason why I hate it. But it represents average people in an ugly and misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is truly despicable.
