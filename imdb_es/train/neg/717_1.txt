It was meant to be a parody of the LOTR trilogy. But this was one of the most horrible movies I've seen in my life. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I do not doubt at any time that there are people who will like this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies in films by acclaimed directors such as Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I am working in a movie theater and in the DVD Shop, and the success of this film was similar in both areas: in the cinema it was a great success (but not very important) during the first two weeks, but later, when the criticisms those who have seen it were not too good, the movie fell very quickly. In DVD sales it was fine for a short time, but nobody asked for it. In the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which was worse, but I am happy that there are so many good movies, so I do not have to think too much about this question.
