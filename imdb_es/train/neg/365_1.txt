The bad plot, the bad dialogue, the bad acting, the idiotic direction, the annoying groove porn soundtrack that was running continuously over the exaggerated script, and a crap copy of the VHS can not be exchanged for the consumption of liquor. Trust me, because I put this turkey to the end. Everything was so pathetically bad that I had to realize that it was a parody of the fourth class of Springtime for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only spark of interest, and that was it. because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar but a thousand times better, look at Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
