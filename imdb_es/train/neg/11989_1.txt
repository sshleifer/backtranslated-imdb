This group of films sets a new standard for poor filmmaking. Jared Rushton offers an adequate performance of a very badly created character in an unfortunate movie, thus creating the net effect of a very bad movie. The main objective of the film is how the temporary excursion of a child to the Canadian desert after surviving a single plane crash allows the adolescent unhappy to deal with his anguish by discovering the extramarital romance of his mother. Unfortunately, it becomes a weird collage of random "survival events" (including two especially funny scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this child is not just sitting in an alley somewhere from the pot dreaming about this whole movie. (And what a nightmare it is!). In addition, despite the heralds of some critics of the family's visibility of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or to see the family, including a graphic scene of the pilot killed underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploited. <Br /> <br /> In short, a terrible film to which no one should be subjected, let alone innocent children.
