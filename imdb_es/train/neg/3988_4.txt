In summary: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly has a lot in mind. He is thinking about racism, colorism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "hetero-sexism", the politics of the war on drugs, etc. etc ... <br /> <br /> That level of consciousness is what is proper is great I think it is a blessing that more and more people choose to examine critically the fundamental aspects of our daily life; The silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious movies does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What appears in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major flaws: <br /> <br /> First of all, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be trying desperately to accommodate every political / social statement he can think of in the 90 minutes. And as such, the final result seems confusing and irresolute since he does not have time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so, exhaust the stereotypes and we are left with hurried testimonies and very loaded dialogues. The final result is very scenic and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Second, when attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of social functions, it seems that it does not have a concrete or original interpretation of the social and political issues presented. What appears is a puddle of regurgitated non-sense. You feel that you bought a basic level sociology textbook and threw out the 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are highly problematic characteristics because the art of cinema is sacrificed and work becomes a speaker for the voice of the filmmaker's voice. He is unable to distance himself from work and allow him to speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a work of art or as a solid political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate that Lee mentioned these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
