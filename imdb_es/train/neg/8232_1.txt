Five in the eyes are not worth one on the wrist, I must admit that at one point I was really worried, for about 30 seconds no one made any noise and I thought that my speakers had gone off or that I had gone deaf with the constant screams and sharp screams , me and the speakers are fine now, thanks for asking, interestingly, it was the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time telling you the plot, read the other comments for that. <br /> <br /> If you have bought this DVD but you have not yet developed it, do not remove it and demand your money, I wasted mine, I do not do the same. <br /> <br /> I was actually screaming at the TV "they're here in the car, they're looking for camera lights, and they get the camera man first", I've left the bad words but you can guess where they're going . <br /> <br /> If someone would like to buy this movie (it's really good) it's yours for ten pounds.
