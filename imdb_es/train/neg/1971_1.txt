This movie is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only shows a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music that brings to the film what makes seeing and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the film is the interview with a Swedish couple who became friends with J.B. Lenoir and shows his private videos, as well as telling stories. The introduction of the filmic subject by Wenders begins in a very interesting way, alluding to the culture of the world (or in fact, to the American culture) that travels in space, but its limited appearance on the subject, as well as the reproduction Funny or absolutely fascinating stories of the 30s show it. The movie as mere help to sleep. Yawn. I had expected more from him.
