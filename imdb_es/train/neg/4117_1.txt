Two days after seeing this, I am still in agony for having seen it. It's so bad, you have to ask yourself how someone could write this gut, let alone allow it to be released among the general public. Forced acting, a prominent man who seems to be walking asleep, and Alison Eastwood embarrasses herself. The action is indicative of the making of low budget films, which means it is terribly bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic, and simply lame.
