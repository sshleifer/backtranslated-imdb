Although the actors do a convincing job interpreting the losers that parade through the screen, the fact that it is impossible to identify with these characters made me look at my watch just 20 minutes after the movie (and more than once after that). The development of the plot is disjointed and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is practically unbearable, the basic quality of most of the actions of the characters and the arrogant way in which they treat is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Ventura Pons to present deaf and disabled characters psychologically. However, this false sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caricias, where the characters mistreat and despise each other for well-founded reasons that develop during that film. In LOVE IDIOTA we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence while stalking a severely depressed and distant woman. Supposedly this is due to his own depression, but the script does not admit it. I will not reveal the rest of the story in case there are masochists out there. Is he cured by his obsession or is the woman surprised by her own depression through her unwavering attention? Although I observed the whole thing, I did not have to worry for a moment about any of them. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogues, bad philosophy, etc ?? The camera work was quite good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to point to show these players in a raw and rough, as it is the worst I've seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of his films (although in person is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose that if the idea is that we are forced to see the lower strata of society to be grateful not to be part of it, then Pons has achieved its goal. The alluvium of almost identical sex scenes was an appropriate waste of the film (if the actors had been filmed but once wearing blue green clothes, the background behind them could have changed in the special effects studio for a misery). It is true that I heard that a large part of the male audience was writhing in their seats during this, but an objective view shows that it was not the real objective of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Beware and see something else.
