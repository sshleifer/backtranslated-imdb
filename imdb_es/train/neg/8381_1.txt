There are some extremely talented black directors like Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and many others who bring a well-deserved recognition to the film industry. Then there are the Wayans Brothers who at one time (15 years ago) had an extremely funny television show "In Living Color" that launched the career of Jim Carrey among others. Now we have stupidity that replaces humor and disgusting gags (toilet humor) as standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those represented in 'Little Man' that could not be. Is it accepted that a baby with a complete set of teeth and a tattoo is only months old? The baby comes with a shadow at five o'clock that shaves. It is implied that the baby has sexual relations with his adoptive mother behind their husbands, Darryl, back. Oh, yes, that's just hilarious. As a criminal master, 'Little Man' is the stupidest on planet Earth. He keeps a stolen rock that is huge in a woman's bag and then has to chase it. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by idiots." Based, without credit, on a cartoon by Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is too stupid to be remotely fun. One clue to how bad this movie is is that Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night, before the BAT awards and he did not mention this terrible movie. When will Hollywood stop the green trash of the Wayans brothers? When they overcome the guilt of their white man in all likelihood.
