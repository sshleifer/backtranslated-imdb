Man, this has a lot of good reviews in the revision books. Frankly, I found it too slow and unattractive from the start. I kept waiting for him to take a little steam, but that never happened. This movie is very overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James' English, has never appealed to me, anyway, so maybe it's just me. There is a fair part of the latter in the first half of the film, as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The positive points of the film include, thanks to a restored impression, some decent ones. The cinematography and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> In general, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some of the scenes to see again. Also, we all know that most of the actors are crazy, anyway, but congratulations to Hollywood for showing it here in this story.
