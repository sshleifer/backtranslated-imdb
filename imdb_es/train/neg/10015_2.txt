Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical teenage movie from the 1950s. It is not a horror or science fiction movie. The conspiracy refers to a group of teenagers who are about to be expelled from their "hot rod" club because they can not pay the rent. Once expelled, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only saving grace for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature costume) turns out to be a jobless movie monster played by Blaisdell.
