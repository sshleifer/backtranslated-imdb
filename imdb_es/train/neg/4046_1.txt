What an insult to the SA film industry! I've seen better SA films. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, saying it's worth ten out of ten, are pretty scary. The rating of a film should not depend on ... "OH, A FILM FROM A COUNTRY OF DEVELOPMENT, WE BOOST YOUR INDUSTRY BY SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT YOUR WORK, EVEN THOUGHT IT IS BAD." We have the experience to make good movies. Do not judge the film industry so people say how cool they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell great stories like Crying the beloved country and Shaka Zulu. Cry to the beloved country. I will give 9 out of 10. Great direction of Darryl, great performance of two great actors of old age, regardless of where they are. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 out of 10. Only people involved in the project could give you high scores. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
