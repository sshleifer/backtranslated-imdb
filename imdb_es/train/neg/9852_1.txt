Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy is inspired by the series "Walking with dinosaurs". Although this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same objective and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinosaurs. Added to being shown in an educational channel, instead of saying that Sci-Fi gives this program an air of objective authenticity. <br /> <br /> On its own, the program is about 7.5 / 10 in regards to entertainment. But the way it is presented I have to give it a 1/10. Do not misunderstand. I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they do it is very bad. I can really see small children and slow adults believing that they found a dragon and that this is real. <br /> <br /> I also think that this weakens the big series "Walking with Dinosuars" because now you have to see that. with a mind of how much fantasy is in that miniseries.
