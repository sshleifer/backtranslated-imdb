Now I understand. The title refers to the immediate subsequent reaction of each member of the audience after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too much to be scary, lacking a good dialogue, even fear of matter makes The Screaming Skull look more like A Snoring Dull. Although, the mansion and the property in black and white set a dark tone for the film, but that's it. The only thing that is scary about this failure is that people really made money with this! Do you remember the coffin guarantee at the beginning? That may be the funniest thing I've seen on the screen. The sad thing is that viewers probably expected director Alex Nichol to be forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed and buried alive for his little effort. Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never feels sympathy for a woman whose anxiety is attributed to a haunted cranial receptacle. In addition, her husband John appears as a mild condescending talker, but this does not work and ends up showing how hard it is to slap a helpless cripple. Ah, Mickey, the days before you could get a restraining order against property keepers like him. The approach of this type is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue. Still, despite its strange personality, Mickey is probably the only good thing that this film offers, as it provides a slight sense of entertainment and I can not get enough of a guy who says "It was Mary! And poking in pots in A greenhouse.
