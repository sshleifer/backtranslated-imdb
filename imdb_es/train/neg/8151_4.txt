The forced play "Deadlock" by Leslie Sands becomes a bad choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, right after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing his wife, an intriguing woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who pretends to be her husband once others begin to pass through the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors of his peak years, unfortunately can not raise this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously distant and restricted to the outrageous end (where he happily pulls out all the stops). Production and distribution of strictly second category distribution; Only for Bette Davis completistas. * 1/2 of ****
