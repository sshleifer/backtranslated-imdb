It all ended with the slashers around 88, so it was time for the tims of those old movies. The brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome, but then in a more corny way as was said before. The acting can go through it. But it is the effects that make you laugh, the so-called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The initial sequence is what makes it worth watching this movie, the hallucinations are very well done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone came alive ... Something about how you keep watching this movie, waiting for what happen next. It is visible to all the monsters that are out there because there is no blood in it and, as it was said, the blood is not there either, but there are nudes for the perverts. I've seen movies worse than this, I just wish they had made it more bloody ...
