With the plot of Alice, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams will begin once again. This time, the mocking assassin is pounding through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? This movie started very well, since we see Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger, who gets trapped in the room and is raped by 100 Manics, then they take her to the hospital, but she is no longer the pregnant woman, but then Amanda gives Give birth to Freddy. . <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who come back from the 4th movie and then they've got some new friends, not long before Freddy starts killing again, I liked the first death, it's okay , not as good as the other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself did not seem scared in this movie, the nightmare was just boring, it was not really scary or creepy at all. <br /> <br /> Acting in the movies was fine for a fifth film of the series, but overall I think this movie was really boring. (It's not yet the worst movie of the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
