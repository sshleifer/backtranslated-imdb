It starts very well, good introduction and development for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same mold as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without supporting the cast or an innovative story that made the Pie films a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest: Heder's performance was pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did the best they could, but they did not have a substantial plot or script to get into the movie. The film simply advances without any rhythm or a clear logical history that justifies its extension. <br /> <br /> The ending is almost predictable. As they come - so predictable I have marked the spoilers box for this single line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really have nothing else to do / listen or watch and even then you will feel that the producers cheated on you in an hour and a half of your life.
