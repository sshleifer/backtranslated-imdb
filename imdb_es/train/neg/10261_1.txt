Wow, I just saw this on TV as one of the "scary" movies shown on Halloween. Was this classified G? There really was nothing that scared this movie or that it was worth watching. Also, other people say that this is a parody, but I do not think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor". This low-budget crap-fest did not have a bit of humor, nor did it make much sense. Basically, you have a ridiculous-looking monster (man in a rubber suit) coming out of cabinets, killing people, I suppose, since you never see the violent monster with anyone or any bloody consequence. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that's good enough. <br /> <br /> The army tries weakly to kill the monster, which is not much bigger than a man. They have very bad aim. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this movie make the US military look pathetic or what? The monster, although it is difficult to kill, does not do much more than move and roar. Oh, and every now and then a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was a bit interesting, but a total Alien scam. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with the scientist who plays the xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand the dialogue very much due to the poor quality of the sound. Besides, why did the monster carry the main weakling boy for so long? Why did not the monster go to the closet when he had the chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense of the foolish?
