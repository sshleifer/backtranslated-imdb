I, like many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in '97. In the best of cases, it was a film below average, definitely not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans like to distinguish. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter how you look at him. People like him because of his appearance. His acting "skills" essentially consist of saying many cheesy lines and trying to act sexually. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with a boy, sails in the toilets, many scenes of fucking love thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize that this is not ingenious in any way. It is not original either. In addition, the director felt the need to prolong it for more than 3 hours. I could compress it in a block of 1 hour without losing anything of the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. That's why I got so much attention and money surpasses me.
