How terrible, TERRIBLE, movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. In general, I like movies like this, all "A man knows an eccentric woman who likes him, but it turns out he's already involved with someone, which is not right for him ...". I expected something predictable and I did not care. Movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but it's not! Every joke falls and the "romance" makes me want to throw up. The character of the title is one of the most "please kill me" of the characters that I have witnessed on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, rather peculiar and annoying. The "other" is the most reasonable and mature person in this movie, but it also turns out to be so annoying. This movie sucks, there's no way to avoid it, do not waste your time.
