Words can not describe how stupid this story is (and, therefore, this movie is so bad)! Basinger, Del Toro ... What were you thinking? So there is a shopping center and its parking space is totally full. The character of Basinger comes in to buy a cup of tea and wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, the whole place is so empty, that nobody hears two shots nearby. Even though she lives there, when she gets away from the bad guys, she goes to the most remote place away from God instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place. COME ON !!! I will not even go into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have done it before. Let's not say how he kills the Moronic thugs one by one. <br /> <br /> This is so stupid, without the slightest bit of logic, I can only warn you to look at it, it's a TOTAL waste of time, honestly!
