Good sir! (and that comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> Much has already been said by critics before (those who rated this piece 3 and below) with which I totally agree, I just like to add some things: <br /> < Between the three types who had to eat their own final digestive products, they were cut by an ax, violated by a broomstick, the balls were blown: the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture by having to listen to the endless and useless babbling of the girl at the kitchen table (just like us, but at least we have the pity of the silence button). <br /> <br /> I had the director cut the point and the endless cemetery scenes and inverted, our suffering would have ended after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this movie at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget it. do not buy it do not waste your time and your sanity. My brain is so fried after seeing this that I feel the urgent need to see (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" at this time.
