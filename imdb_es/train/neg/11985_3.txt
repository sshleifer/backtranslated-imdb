Have you ever wanted to eat worms? Here is a 'documentary' to show you how! Yes ... The child eats live worms! And that is the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This critique has been pretty well summed up by previous critics as quite boring. I totally agree here. The movie is not going anywhere ... unless you like to eat worms! This is a movie for which it is almost impossible to write a spoiler ... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: they should have cut that kid's hair. Who are you trying to look like? Bozo the clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to become the hairy dog ​​or something like that. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; The child was too thick to look hungry! I should have kept him away from junk food for a couple of weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie almost puts me to sleep. And my kids could only drive about 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the landscape was very impressive. And, if there had been a decent story, it could have been a success. <br /> <br /> He seemed safe enough for the children to see: the "strange" bear and eyeball scenes were too weak to scare most children, and the brief "immersion" scene thin "did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave this one a very generous 3.
