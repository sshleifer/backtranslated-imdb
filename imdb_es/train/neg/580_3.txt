Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and a bad performance as a complement. <br /> <br /> This story of vampire hunters is the worst I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico in search of blood suckers! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of Van Helsig's network of vampire hunters, he's fine, but he works alone. She has been assigned to the search for a powerful vampire queen who is looking for a black crucifix to perform a ritual that will allow her to be invulnerable to sunlight (it is almost a sequel to Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starring James Woods ), Derek began his search in search of the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, also acting very bad) an inexperienced teenager, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a vampire in particular and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter. So, obviously, in this adventure you are not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this movie would be simply to see its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); There is a big difference in the quality of the performance compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you will get involved in one of the most simple stories, totally predictable, with terrible acting performances. Really bad special effects and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend not watching this movie!, rent another movie, watch another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
