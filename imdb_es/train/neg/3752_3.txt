I grew up watching and loving TNG. I recently finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have increased my feeling of disgust with this episode, since the difference in style and focus between the two shows could not be clearer. The idea may have been good if it was used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how it would probably have been treated in VOY. They could have presented memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitating clips from old shows. The entry and exit transitions between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode start as a clich√© at the beginning, and quickly become intolerable as the pattern of fatigue goes on and on. Bar none, worst episode of all.
