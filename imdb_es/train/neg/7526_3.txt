This is the high grade cheese rate of the Kung Fu movies of the film B. Bruce "Wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, we're going to show you quick clips of Bruce and make a close-up of his eyes and, if you keep at the right angle during a certain time of day during the winter solstice, he looks like Bruce. You will laugh at how the splicing of the movie is not very good, but some deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are included in the mix. According to the movie, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this may excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, although his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's gestures and fighting style, very POORLY). See Bruce go one by one with the cowardly lion. The prop department stopped at Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with brutally beating a crippled man. Towards the end, the director decided "let's throw a flashback" for a scene that was shown 3 minutes ago! They should have thought that only unicellular organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this movie. <br /> <br />
