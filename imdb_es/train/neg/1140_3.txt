Scary, but especially in the sense that it will end before he turns 70. I saw this as a nighttime replay in 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scared because it looks as if a taxidermist had stuffed it. Yvette Mimeux seems to have smoked all the beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is a turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing but repetitions of the Roller Derby Chamionship of 1972, then I guess it's better than that. But God help you if this is your only entertainment option.
