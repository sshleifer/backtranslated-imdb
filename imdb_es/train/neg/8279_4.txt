This movie had all the elements to be a clever and sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the fool's way. Maybe he really did not know who his audience was: but it's not a men's movie given the cast and plot, however, it's too slapstick and silly-blonde to attract women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, then this is like the disconcertingly terrible sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have achieved much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than funny. <br /> <br /> Many of the things in this movie were painted by numbers, the various super clich√© montages, the last minute "misunderstanding", even the chaos of the children's party. This simply suggests a lazy writing. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this movie nice if you do not take it seriously, but it is so obvious that you can do better than you will probably feel frustrated and frustrated. More and more disappointed as the scenes go by.
