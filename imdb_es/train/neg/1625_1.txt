When I was in school I made a film about a couple wandering through the trees and talking, and I realized halfway through the editing that this was not just a flawed aesthetic strategy but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: the soaked lyricism married to the vacancy, the stabbed metaphor stabbed at the social commentary. But despite the flaws of my own movie, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. On the one hand, mine lasted 20 minutes, not 85, and I had more content about it: every useless part of business here is acquired for four, five, six relentless minutes. The masculine protagonist is simply incredible, a rapturous voice with the outbursts of dramatic class improvisation among the philosophical ideas taken from the pub U of T, and it gives him a lot of space to hate him. Admittedly, if it were not a big hole, then the third act would make even less sense, since a couple of sarcastic types appear to provide distant and totally useless echoes of "exploitation" values; but it does not make it easier to see the "please" who crawls in the cage until the magazine runs out. I withdraw what I said about AUTUMN NORN, that at least had the courage of its own malicious lust: this cinematic crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least, I really hope so.
