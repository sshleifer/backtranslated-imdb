As much as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A publicity stunt in the final filth of what seems to have been a distinguished and idealistic career, Pacino does his part as a bed undone and assaulting everyone with a totally false and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot is rolled in this way and with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind wobbles (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, without doing much. His scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe that they meant a lot to each other. There is no power there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, turned on the screen. It was electric and his scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from shame.
