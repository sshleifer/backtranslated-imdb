I like silent movies, but this was a bit too silly. As much as I wanted to be able to say that it was worth the time I woke up, I can not. I do not think any version of the movie comes close to the book. And do not try with the children, they could go crazy. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that labor laws were different back then ... BUT SEE IN PEOPLE.
