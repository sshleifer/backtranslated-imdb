My girlfriend chose this; As an African American born and raised in the South, I found the plot and the premise of this film totally without credibility. Believing that racial and class prejudices would be suspended so easily and comfortably would only come from someone who was not familiar with the ante-bellum sur. Totally absurd! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (whom the south knows better) to participate in this shit.
