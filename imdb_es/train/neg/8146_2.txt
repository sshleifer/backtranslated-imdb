1st seen 11/7/2002 - 2 of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty malicious movie about mobsters about a family like a Godfather in Brooklyn who likes to say four-letter words and kill people. The only thing of interest here was his attempt to show that the feds are very similar to the gang. This is the only attempt to make a good movie. The rest of the film was predictable and inexpensive. The quality of the photography in some of the scenes inside bars and loose joints almost makes you think that there was a problem with your DVD player due to the bad contrasts and some of the actors were difficult to hear sometimes due to the bad sound. The performance was quite characteristic of all your favorite gang members of best movies with cursory names like Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot practically followed those patterns as well. Then, go see a better gangster movie before spending your money for it.
