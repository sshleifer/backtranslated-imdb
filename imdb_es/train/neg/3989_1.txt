Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song while portraying an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his battered wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as strong as dialogue, so one can not hear anything, diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had. The scenes of Annabella being beaten by her father with her fists, a lamp and then a belt were so caricatural that they were absurd. This whole movie is a caricature, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally amazing. The discussion of black women after Flipper's wife discovered that he had cheated on her with a white woman, as if it were a discussion of an Oxford debate team, is ridiculous. Rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mix during this "movie" is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie. You can not understand the basic job of making films, the soundtrack, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors who try to keep this film afloat. In fact, I felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this movie; his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I've seen by this director and it will be the last.
