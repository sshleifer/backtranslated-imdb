you have a strong stomach Holden was actually 55 years old on the set, but he seemed to be close to 70 and only lived another 8 years. At one point, Holden said: "I am more than twice your age." Okay, try triple grandfather! The theme "old enough to be your father" for which they shot did not work. Elderly people sometimes end up with legal teenagers. More power for them, but that does not mean they want to see it. It is not a matter of judgment but of the digestive route. I like my food where it belongs. It's fun to see Lenz and cars, clothes, furniture, etc. The 70's make it worthwhile if you come by cable late at night and want to see something to relax in bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde friend, who made fun of her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly spacious ... Who was this girl? I will try to find out.
