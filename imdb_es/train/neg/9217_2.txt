Yes, the only thing that makes this film memorable is that it starred Tom Hanks, a young man who, a few years later, would be a relevant star in Hollywood. However, here is no film that shows much of his talent and the only other thing that could be considered something entertaining about this film is the scene where he believes he sees a monster and crosses a man. Yes, this film is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to create interesting scenarios. Basically, a special type for after school about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons, ingeniously renamed here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the creators of this movie thought that nerds should not have any fun unless they were going out to drink alcoholic beverages to minors, drugs, have many unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all popular children. No, these bad people were playing a game that really required you to use your brain, not heaven! It's not that, if they have a brain, they can actually think for themselves and not be washed by certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are far fewer people who died carrying out Dungeons and Dragons in their entire existence, than saying what they say driving while intoxicated in a month.
