The secret is ... this movie blows. I'm sorry, but he just did it. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID THE LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, was Join several Friends on a spring break trip. The group rents a luxury house and tries to enjoy a fun holiday. Then, the deaths begin. First one is killed, then another, another, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note, Dorie Barton is poor Reese Witherspoon. He looks like Reese, acts like Reese and could go through Reese in a police lineup. Maybe that's how they threw her out? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair acting could not compensate for the bad dialogue and the terrible writing.
