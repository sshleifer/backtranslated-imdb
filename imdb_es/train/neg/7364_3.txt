In 1692, Salem, an evil child, lies about the involvement of a slave in witchcraft sends an entire community to a rampage. The costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not suffocating, but neither is it a vivid representation of contagious hysteria. Worked by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the elements of the story are quite interesting (especially when leaving Hollywood in 1937), although for anyone who has read "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller, The Melodrama in Display here will not be tolerated for long. The biggest problem with the image may be in the cast: Colbert and MacMurray are a couple of lovers who do not fit with the witch hunt, MacMurray is a presence too contemporary in these environments. * 1/2 of ****
