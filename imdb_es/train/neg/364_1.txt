Larry Buchanan Yes, the same guy who did "The Eye Creatures Attack" and two (count them: TWO) conspiracy movies about Marilyn Monroe. He is the culprit, here. <br /> <br /> Adding to your ever-growing stack of folders that are in Oliver Stone's conspiracy drawer "I-I grew out of it", here's "Down On Us (ie," Beyond of the doors "), which is the functional definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you THINK you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar ', because this is the Y'see, the three great names in the rock of the 60s were killed by the government because they were subversive or counterproductive for Truth, Justice and American Way, or summarizing like that there. <br /> Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who strangely resemble their real-life shadows (that is, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths, the good old man from the USA hits them! Yes, it's the truth! <br /> <br /> Man, I can not believe I've seen this movie. It's true, when not. str Engraved credibility to the set point, they are ridiculous; the performance makes TV commercials look like a great drama and if you honestly watch it until the end, you deserve the end of "spin". Really, you really do it; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said: "Rock and roll is dead, live rock and roll". <br /> <br /> Not this movie, however. <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "Down on Us". And that's the audience of the movie that describes the movie, by the way ...
