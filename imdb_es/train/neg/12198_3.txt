Growing up with the Transformers of Beast Wars, I was not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen the incredible movie, and now that I've seen the oldest caricature on which it is based, I must say that I like the Cartoon originals and the live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like BW characters, I just think characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" It sounds a lot better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me firmly believe that he is a true commander, rather than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what is cooler, robots become animals or robots change. In vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original Transformers any day on Beast Wars!
