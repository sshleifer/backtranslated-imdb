Well, where should I start? I think it's very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was very disappointed! the acting is horrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, now I'm 25 years old and Annie is still one of my favorite movies, so I was really excited to see Annie 2. The acting was horrible in the movie, were some of the original characters? Very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie that I want to see again, and any lover of Annie I recommend that you do not see this movie because it will only leave you very disappointed. The young girls who sing are not bad but they still do not compare with the original ones
