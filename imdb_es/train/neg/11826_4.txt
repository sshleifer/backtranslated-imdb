There is something sad about seeing someone who is so good at something, tries to do something very different ... and ends up being mediocre. I was thinking of Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is reasonably well acted and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story to a comedy in "Roxanne", but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene goes into a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story updated with a certain style, better rent "Great expectations".
