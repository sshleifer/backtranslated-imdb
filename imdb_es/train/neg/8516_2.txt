Last week, I took a look at Nielsen's weekly ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you're not watching." <br /> <br /> Well, they're right that you're not seeing it. It was broadcast twice and ranked 147th and 145th out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: this is the lowest rated program on any national broadcast network ... and rightly so. I tried to see it a couple of times because all the coverage of the press promoted it as a "great" show, a "realistic look" to life and all that kind of nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is a boring woman. It is as unreal as it seems, and deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only Mystery is the reason why CW felt compelled to put on its inaugural calendar the lowest program in memory, after two years of commercial and artistic failure.
