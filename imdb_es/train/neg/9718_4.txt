An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a one-night stand with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She sees a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked outside, but she can not call the police because that would ruin her marriage to Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). So Guttenberg, the honest citizen he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed about half an hour later, appears and claims to have witnessed the first attack, with the intention of transmitting the information that Huppert gave him. Well, never make false testimonies against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch a murderer quickly becomes crooked. When she meets the first nearby victim, McGovern, she immediately complains about what happened, but agrees to remain silent for the time being. But then Guttenberg is in court, is supposed to identify the heavy (Greenquist) and discover through an interrogation that is SEEN CLOSE and can not identify objects at a distance, much less expensive. (Not that it matters because, after all, he never saw the trail in the first place). The plot becomes practically labyrinthine. Guttenberg leads the main suspect when Huppert is also killed. <br /> <br /> He barely escapes arrest and takes refuge in the now friendly McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern devise a plan to catch the killer. She will serve as bait. They will follow the sigil of the flag in one of their sordid places and McGovern will act like the imbecile for which the murderer is attracted, only to try to kill her. But everything will be fine, you see, because not only Guttenberg will watch her closely, and not only will she alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will also keep a can of mace handy, just in case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, the alert observer, is this scenario going according to plan? Elizabeth McGovern has a curiously interesting bone structure. It seems sometimes jaw and small mouth, but it is vibrant. Steve Guttenberg has hair in his strength and that's it. Otherwise, he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it is not evident in this movie. The killer is so trained and so prepared that he seems to be wearing one of those deformity masks in the Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Was the director, Curtis Hanson, unable to continue? "LA Confidential"? That was a job well done. Here, everything seems clumsy and artificial, even the smallest parts. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is presented to delay McGovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a small part as a late buyer. He is a clean and always reliable boy. Paul Shenar as the cuckolded husband has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he also does a good job. <br /> <br /> That informal articulation where McGovern attracts the killer's attention, where he plays billiards with a pair of hairy monkeys, was shot in a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where she lived. The way the interior is configured, it is clear that it is supposed to be a dirty and dangerous dive. Actually, it seems far more elegant on the screen than in reality. <br /> <br /> In general, this is Hitchcock's territory and it brings tears to your eyes as you imagine what you would have done with this story.
