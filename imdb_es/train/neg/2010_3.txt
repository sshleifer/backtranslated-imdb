Oh, it's the movie. I thought I waited too long to get the dog out ... I can not believe I've seen it all. I guess I was optimistic that I was going to improve. Horribly unconnected dialogues, pathetic performances and totally unlikely events. Like Toby's mother, hanging herself in the time it takes Col up and down in a room with a 24-foot ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her motionless suspended body that she could possibly have used to climb herself . The girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actress in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was in second place. The basic story has potential and a good script and a director could be a really scary movie, but this version, unfortunately, is not. I open up more when I open my electric bill every month.
