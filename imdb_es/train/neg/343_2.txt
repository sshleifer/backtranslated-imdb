Rosanna Arquette, a wonderful and truly terrible Canadian-German co-production, plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child", a few years before the "action" that the boy murdered his father, and his mother The fall of the offspring. Now he has moved to the northwest of the USA. UU To start over, but your child still has a problem because he has dedicated it to his mother. So devout, in fact, that it kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (as the daughter) murders more than other people: she offers such a terrible performance that she also erases out of the movie, although the incoherent script, the useless direction and the dreadful music ( look at the saxophone the first time he shows his body in a bikini) does not help; We're supposed to find it sexy and scary, but it fails in both cases. Almost completely uninviting and not even bad enough to be fun (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer really do not convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, who are worthy of much more than this, and both (particularly Rosanna) are the only sensible reasons for someone to feel in this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films, not since the three hours "Love, Lies And Murder" (of Two Short Productions) has there been a credit of "You must be kidding".
