Without reiterating what was said earlier about this film, I would like to add that I was looking forward to seeing this movie ... the cast / location and work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom, etc. ... I had a vague shadow of 'Do not look now' on the story from the beginning. A stay in a different environment (again Italy) to mitigate the anguish of loss ... or maybe I saw it that way? So, as a result, I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and I took a turn for what we hope will happen to this family in a foreign European country ... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? Nothing really happens! and I mean nothing! You are not even given the opportunity to enter the characters, since they are so three-dimensional and empty. For the rhythm of the movie, you are made to believe that something was going to happen to make the whole movie go crazy ... The older daughters who flirted with the children of the local scooter, had a great reach to take the film to another Direction, the visions of the youngest daughters of her dead mother ended up being an unsuccessful and useless exercise, the parents tried to be seduced by one of their students. He felt ridiculous given his age. It felt as if the script had a final memory where they decided, at the last moment, to eradicate any courage from the story and reduced it to a minimum so that it had no effect. When the credits started rolling (unexpectedly) you can not help but feel robbed of your time spent watching this pile of garbage.
