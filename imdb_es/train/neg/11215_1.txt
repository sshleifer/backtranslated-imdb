Well, at first, this movie seemed pretty good, although it was moving pretty fast and although they only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was good, but if you found your dead sister in a lake and discovered who could have killed her, why would you go? hunting? He surrounded him and pointed to him with a single bullet, he squandered it and ended up fleeing from him, was he delayed and killed him? Also, after you found your dead sister in the lake, you found a clue and you found out who the killer was, why did not you give that clue to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she behaves like her sister, who was a waitress and is talking to the bad guy who should have known him somewhere, she recorded it saying she was dead and what happened with her "test". I do not know, I was not happy with the ending. This film could have been much better if it lasted longer and the performance was better and if the ending was not so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do, you will also write a review here and you will not be happy.
