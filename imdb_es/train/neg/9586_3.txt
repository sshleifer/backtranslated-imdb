After the disastrous Revolution, this film was practically the last nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and, therefore, in the British film industry. The film is absolute, full of music from the attempt to revive the jazz of the mid-80s and is based on a book and author who was briefly popular at that time and deservedly sinks back into darkness. Temple searched for years trying to find Suzette and it occurred to 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett, another person who was briefly popular at that time. When the film came out of post-production, the rebirth of the Jazz was over, just like Kensett's career and the film met a totally carefree film audience. <br /> <br /> Mediocre would be an exaggeration for some of the worst / campers / cheesest√° performance for the grace of the British silver screen to see it for almost 20 years and the film is truly worthy of admiration.
