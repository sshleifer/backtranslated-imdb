Look carefully at the wonderful variety of talents gathered to make this film: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even cameos from Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove, by far, the adage that a good cast can not save a bad script. The story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have even exceeded Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and the "turns" are downright cruel.
