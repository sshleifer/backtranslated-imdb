I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and the movie were a Sleuth scam. Michael Caine wants to be Olivier, and Reeves wants to be Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jewish law? You mean the one who did the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious that he needed to pay the gambling debts. I would do anything for money. He would star in such award-winning films as this one, and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure." What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is the death of Reeves. He deserves something better than being remembered for this terrible movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 container at Walmart. Along with gems like "La Isla", and "Blame it on Rio".
