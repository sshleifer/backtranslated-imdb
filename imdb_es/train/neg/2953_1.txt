These critics claim that this movie is so bad that good go way over this one. This movie does not have the evil of guilty pleasure that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their horror, but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad it hurts. I have not had so much pain seeing a bad movie since I saw Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before starting the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust that The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They reduce the losses by sending them directly to the video, which makes it the most expensive movie to the video in decades. Whoopi collapsed to be in this mess after a huge paycheck. <br /> <br /> A plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun that would kill humanity and start another Ice Age. A policewoman named Katie Coltrane and an idiot dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly join to stop him after the death of a dinosaur friend. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the movie that robs the Film of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really horrible. Whoopi seems agitated and is trying to ally with his performance, but without success. Theodore Rex is totally annoyed and his clumsy behavior is exhausted after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him and threaten to bite people and hit them with the tail (in case of accident and with a purpose). I thought the thief was bad, but Theodore Rex is in the background: the worst movie in Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to enjoy. I did not see that when I saw this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who must have felt some admiration for the movie Howard The Duck. Humor is at that level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's innate cousin. Totally painful from start to finish.
