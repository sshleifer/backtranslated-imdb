One of the most boring slashers in history ... If you can call it that. I would not see it if it even ended up being a kind of porn movie, which is completely similar. The fact that you are seeing a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They made these kinds of movies for teenagers, so who did they really aim for when they made this dream festival? My favorite part of this movie is the cover and it's the only reason why I chose to look for this movie, which turned out to be part of a package of Suspense Classics 50 movies ... and after seeing the other films in this pack of 50 , you 'll realize that it does not belong to any other part. So if you fancy a good slasher in the forest, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
