Ah, the sex and gore movie. It's a shame they do not do it anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out that way, that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of two lovely vampires collecting "johns" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except the first victim). , to those who keep for no particular reason). Things get complicated when a woman who is camping with her husband feels too curious about these mysterious women that she continues to see. It gets really ugly from here. In the end, the two vampires are so thirsty for blood that they are eating everything they have in sight, and they manage to let their captive victim escape. Go, so much for that secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that the two vampires do not mind taking off their clothes and playing with them is the only thing this movie can do. Otherwise, it's a bloody and confusing mess (why is your grave so far from your castle?), That you can only see it for the few minutes of vampire play. The only thing I got from this movie were these two valuable tips: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and, do not pick up the prostitutes along a country road; They are probably vampires. Apart from that, it really was not worth my time.
