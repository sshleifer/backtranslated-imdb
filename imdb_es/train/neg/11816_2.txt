Losing yourself in the frozen space for 15 years, that's unlikely. Falling into a star ... improbable. Falling into it the day it becomes a supernova and explodes ... ridiculously. Being rescued by a boat right at that moment ... it's priceless. <br /> <br /> No, it's not the Golden Heart of Zaphod Beeblebrox to the rescue. Neither is the father of the year winners. After sentencing her daughter to two years of imprisonment in an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander alone with the strange man they have picked up. This prefigures his skill in hand-to-hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action. The highlights of combat include, for example, the psychopath who talks face to face with a woman, while blindly pointing the gun behind him towards the other one about two inches away, which is sympathetically in the fire line. <br /> <br /> In the end, the family of three leaves the ship the size of a metropolis they planned to use to observe the supernova until the last moment because it is too slow to escape the blast, instead of that uses the psycho's combat ship that they have refueled in a minute. with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7 kiloton missile. You have to love those hard science fiction statistics! <br /> <br /> As Hollywood handles writing as an irrelevant subject, they will continue to make films that can not be played at 3 a.m. on the science fiction channel.
