Seeing "Surrender, Dorothy" from CBS, I was wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie, with the shortage of attractive roles for slightly older actresses, it's no wonder why Prize Winner Academy artists such as Keaton turn to television, but as Keaton does not offer opportunities to shine). A single mother, afflicted by the sudden death of her daughter in her twenties, imposes, and little by little becomes friends with, the group of young people with whom her daughter was close at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay game gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that one could cross the street to avoid. Apart from being coarse and tenuous, these fake people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy setting and the bungalow near the beach where the children reside (a young man, who wears muscular shirts to tell us he is gay, listens to Diane Keaton say "Surrender, Dorothy" and actually ask: "That's from" The Wizard of Oz ", right?" ... no, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane"!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the theme of confronting death. Try to turn this clearly unpleasant woman into a shadow of her own character (many outlandish outfits), but it does not sit well with the viewer, since Keaton has always been warmly friendly and flexible in an incomparable way. Here, she is a crazed harpy who does not learn many lessons in her journey of self-discovery (the film quickly forgets that it is a dead girl and becomes an odyssey for the nervous shock of a mother, who seems to be an older hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors who promote in the talk shows with the warning: "I should help many mourning mothers". I can not imagine helping anyone, as it is intrinsically disappointing, confusing and disconcerting. He is upset.
