Otto Preminger directs this light as a story of feathers. The bohemian Jean Seberg and his equally bohemian father, David Niven, in the south of France with Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until the family friend, Deborah Kerr, appears. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too difficult to resist. That's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as she has done with all women in her past ... including Demongeot). When it seems that he is becoming the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg took revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with more brightly colored scenes. The cinematography of Georges Périnal is impressive. The film presents some of Preminger's less harsh instructions, although it rarely allows close-ups, which makes it difficult to distinguish what the actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is full of acidic dialogues and funny scenes (mainly with Demongeot with bird brain). Seberg defends himself quite well, but Niven is less attractive ... and does not show chemistry either with Seberg or with Kerr. Preminger is really wrong with that casting. It is a paper that seems tailored to someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as an aspirant to Seberg's suitor and Martita Hunt as his unhappy mother. Juliette Gréco, playing herself, sings the main song in a nightclub in Paris. The big titles are from regular Preminger Saul Bass.
