A "subculture" of BDSM from Los Angeles serves as a backdrop for this low-budget, poorly constructed mess, clearly a piece of vanity for its high-level player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and writes while playing a double role as twin sisters Vanessa and celia. Soon a question arises about whether a poorly lit pyrotechnic camera and editor can reach a point of connection with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensible viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for Los Angeles County, while her evil twin has become an iconic figure within her fetish world largely due to erotic renditions on CD-ROM, but when it happens A disaster, "Mrs. Vanessa", virtuoso Celia, determined to unearth the vicious attacker of her sister, begins a new job as "sex slave" in the private Castle Club, where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party" . It is assigned to two FBI field agents (whose deployment in the case of Vanessa is apparently required due to their participation in the BDSM Internet sites), in addition to a homicide detective from the Los Angeles Police Department, to investigate the crime , while striving to provide security to Celia, whose enthusiastic performance of her new vocation is sufficiently guaranteed by her clients to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Failures in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide assigned to the Southern Operations Office of L.A.P.D., a region of the metropolis that is far from the stage of the film. The direction is out of focus and is not assisted by erratic postproduction editing and sound reproduction. The aforementioned photographic gymnastics culminates with an extravagant montage near the end of the film of previous images that refers tangentially to the stage. A solid acting turn appears among this scum: Stan Abe as a jealous FBI agent.
