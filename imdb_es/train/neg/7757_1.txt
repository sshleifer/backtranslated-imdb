I also have some advice for the people who made this movie, if you're going to make a movie like this, make sure you have the f / x to back it up. Also, do not get a lot of actors from the z list to play in it. Another thing, almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so do not copy it blatantly. In general, this movie was wasted, f / x sucked, acted sucked, not original story. Let's talk about acting for just a second, the Carradine boy whose career peaked in 1984 when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). It's not exactly the z list, it can act. I should have said no to this bag. I should have done what Mark Hamill did after the "Return of the Jedi" and spend quietly at night. He left his mark as a "Nerd" and that should have been that. I understand that you have bills to pay, but that does not justify this bag s - t. Have I called this movie already? IN AGREEMENT. I just wanted to make sure. If it sounds a bit hostile to me, I apologize. I only wasted 2 hours of my life, I could have spent doing something productive like looking at the painting and I feel cheated. I'll close that note. Thanks for your time.
