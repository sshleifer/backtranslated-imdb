With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with the full force of the film while clearly stating in the film that his work is one of "objectivity". Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'taken by chance' are obvious configurations (when that poor goat 'accidentally' falls off the cliff, you can see the smoke from the gun to the right of the screen!). On the other hand, his concealment of important information: the people of Hurdes was as it was for a specific reason mentioned in the film. That is, goiter, a disease caused by a lack of iodine (salt). This goiter is the cause of his cretinism and if Bunuel just took the time to do his research (hell, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary that had found 'goiter'), he COULD have told the truth about these people ( still, I doubt). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as 'cretins', over and over again, dramatizing the action, setting up scenes to create the show, all this very unacceptable for a documentary maker who intends to work for an all-powerful objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this movie, without saying a word to the people he is filming. He speaks for them and, even so, judges them. This piece has defects in its roots, in its ideology and it is a pity that it is considered a great film.
