When I borrowed this film from a friend (luckily I did not buy it) in the package (which really looked bad and ugly) it was printed "The Horror of the Vampire par excellence". After seeing it, I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> The lighting, the sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a festive video at ten o'clock. VHS system one year old if not worse. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promotional t-shirts looked great. I do not want to discourage film students or splash movies in general, but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a movie with a budget of $ 20 student that was ten times better than this crap.
