I watched this premiere weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite the excellent performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was very thin ... which does not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were some other positive points, the support of Edgerton in particular, Jordan's assured management (confirming his talent also in Buffalo Soldiers) and the production design that gave a real hard feel to the Australian bush, as did Irish immigrants. of the early nineteenth century should have seen it. But I can not help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the true story of an Australian popular hero (or him?) ... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the image in the United States. Oh, well, at least Jordan and the producers did not accept losing their beards just to please Universal ... <br /> <br /> I guess I'll have to settle for the excellent "Kelly's Secret Story" by Peter Carey Gang. 4/10
