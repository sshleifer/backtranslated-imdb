or anyone praying for the vision of Al Cliver fighting a naked 7-foot-tall Negro to become a complete Nelson, his movie has arrived! Film star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group that demands the ransom of $ 6 million to be delivered to her refuge on the island. What they do not count on is the robust Vietnam veteran Peter Weston (Cliver) who was hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they did not really count on was a local tribe that likes to offer young women to their cannibal god monster with bloodshot eyes. <br /> <br /> Almost the same filming as CANNIBALS, this time The rates are a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly to a hilarious dubbing track and the incredibly ridiculous monster with bulging eyes ( Franco confirms that they were ping pong balls in the disc interview). Franco has a strong supporting cast of EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most shocking things I've ever seen as a guy who is not him, shows up close, trying to be him.). The film presents tons of nudes and the gore (variety of Tempra painting) is there. The highlight for me was the fist fight of the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the waves. Unfortunately, old Jess did it for 1 hour and 40 minutes of amazement (and, sometimes, agonizing) when he should have reached 80 minutes maximum. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Severin's DVD looks pretty good, but there are some strange ghost images that occur during some of the darker scenes. Also, a long section of the dialogue is in Spanish without subs (they are an option, but only when you hear the track in French). Franco gives a nice 16-minute interview about the film and has much nicer things to say about Buchfellner than his star CANNIBALS, Sabrina Siani.
