The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most frightening and amateur films I've ever seen, and it's located next to Hands, Hands of Fate in terms of bad acting, pointless direction and production values ​​at kindergarten level. In this movie, a silly-looking claymation / stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, California, and starts eating at local haystacks. In the exciting climax, the creature, described by one of the locals as "a giant finned alligator," drags its huge dough on the ground to pursue its possible lunch, before a bulldozer hits it a couple of times and dies of boredom. . Each character in this moovie is a complete imbecile. A meaningless subplot shows an entrance in a liquor store to buy a pint of Ripple for $ 4.75; Instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another spectator, he shoots a policeman, they chase him towards the lake, everything so that the monster can eat it. The unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal that it is nothing more than a piece of Styrofoam. There is a fake wizard who struggles with a fake British accent (to make it seem more legitimate), two tenants of clumsy boll boobs, a little corny prehistoric cave made with crayon, and the annoying banjo-pickin background 'moosic. In a painful scene, the false magician and his dopey wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to fill the film 4 more minutes to see how the stars can see in the night sky, although it is clearly daytime. Even in constant advancement, this moovie hurts and hurts a lot. MooCow says to call the fumigators, because this cow pie really sucks! : = 8P
