I hated this movie so much that I remember it vividly. It's not even funny. Any film that is based on sexual jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. All I could think was "he deserves it, for making such a bad movie". Do not waste your time or money on this.
