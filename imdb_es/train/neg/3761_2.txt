Foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail directly in the head. Make sure you read it. In case you do not, a group of scientists goes to the depths of the Pacific Northwest, to grope with a lot of bones in an animal cemetery. The Big Foot family is not friendly with this, and proceeds to eliminate the team one by one, largely off the screen. Big Foot himself has a clearly ape-like face, but in general he is less scary than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the film has generic wooden actors posing as scientists who walk through the woods and move away. This is a movie without a budget in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We have the opportunity to see the sexiest females shower while one of his companions looks at him, but this is not about anything.
