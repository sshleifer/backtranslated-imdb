For shame, for shame that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes be carried away by this nauseating nonsense. The film was not only bad, it was also horrible and did not have a redeeming quality. The plot, (was there one?) It seemed to go nowhere. The Russians played silly killing games or killed and the rest of the cast should be declared void for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. A "1" for horrible just because there is nothing lower. Do not waste your time with this, you will not miss anything.
