I did not feel that I had been raped as I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but the MAGICAL WORLD OF BELLE remains the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, although not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly, not canonical, idiotic, and the writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we love from BATB at all, they are a group of pod people. I wanted to dissect it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because no one in their right mind would take this trap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The word perfect" is an oppressive and heavy study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" only works if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is a James Bond villain and that Lumiere is an idiot with respect to women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind", as I like to call it) is probably the most atrocious of the group. Does the beast hate birds? Since when? Do not look at this shit, all the copies of this video deserve to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST remains a classic film, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
