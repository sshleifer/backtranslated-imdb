How do I start to review a film that will soon be recognized as the "worst movie of all time" by the "worst director of all time"? A film that could develop a cult following because it's "so bad that it's good?" <br /> <br /> An analytical approach that criticizes the film seems both useless and part of the gang car syndrome: let's make it free without worrying about violent reactions because all other human beings on earth are doing it, and the people who like the movie like it because of those flaws that we would cite. <br /> <br /> The universal poor quality of the film is evident: 'Sixteen years of alcohol' It is not exempt from competition for the title of the worst movie, so it has to sink a lot to get the title and keep it, but I think this movie could go far. " IMDb does not allow enough words to quote all the failures of the movies, and it will be much easier to locate the elements that 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol' does well. Unfortunately, those moments of glory are so hidden in the shadows of the poverty of this film that it is a task that is not worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting into, I had been warned to take several cups of coffee before sitting down to see this (I wish the suggestion would have been vodka cups). Despite my low expectations, "Sixteen years of alcohol" did not entertain me even at a level of "making fun of the bad movie". Not only bad, but terribly bad, as if Jobson intentionally tried to make this movie a poetic yawn, but it was exaggerated and pushed poetry down our throats so that it was not deep but fun. .. and supposedly Jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie? Even after seeing the promotional literature of 'Sixteen Years of Alcohol', I find it hard to believe Jobson's sincerity. Useless and unpleasant until the end with several moments of smile / giggle (all of which I'm sure none is intentional) flavored the movie, and those few elements prevented me from turning off the DVD. How bad is that good? No. I had enough 'I can not believe that this is a serious moment in a movie' to avoid being turned off, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a group of bad guys. Connoisseurs of the movie Get your own comment in motion. That would have significantly improved the experience for me. So bad is that Mike Myers comment on his cod the Scottish accent on him as he runs, to turn all this mud into a comical farce "Ok, dare ma man, pass me the magic of dat wiskey".
