Warning spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, I was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about such an interesting real story. He had such a promise, but the performance was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something outside of a theme park. I found myself laughing while looking, what it was supposed to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the death of the "King". I liked the punishment of the queens. And, the final shot made a beautiful photo, however. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
