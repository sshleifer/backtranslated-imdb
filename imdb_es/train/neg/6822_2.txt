Drones, ethnic percussion, bad synthesizing, children singing. The most paternalistic "music of the world" imaginable. This is a tourist movie, and lousy. What really kills him are incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. There are no transitions, there is no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, with no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of third-person images of the world with "baskets in the head," as another critic said. Walking unceasingly as if that had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were filmed and shoot in Mexico. That would have been a much better scenario for "life in transformation." <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was an untidy tourist itinerary that covered half the world and incredibly overloaded filter shots. The only thing I recommend this movie is that it does not stink as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
