This had all the characteristics of a very good movie: good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious space missile threatens to burn the planet) and many archive images (if the Air Force had a movie of Fire rocket jets, was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film deals with a missile from space that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit. With less than five miles and a speed of more than 4,000 miles, it emits a one-million-degree exhaust, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, distant early warning line (DEW) bases and Eskimos. . <br /> <br /> Any attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first flaws in this movie appear from the beginning. While we do not expect much from low budget movies, some things can not be forgotten, like a little research. For example, both the Soviets and the USA. UU They fire anti-ballistic missiles that are located in the missile with infallible precision. However, the Russians did not perform the first ABM tests successfully until March 1961. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with as much wood as a log cabin. The character of Parker cries and despairs at the sacrifice of Loggia as if he were in a screen test. Loggia is as heroic as a boring businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) criticizes him so much that he makes William Shatner look like a theater actor. A bus driver continually spits trash from the end of the world scene after scene. The only good actor is the narrator of the film, played by veteran actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this could be overlooked if it were not for the timeline. After the missile information is sent to DC, the Pentagon gathers a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will arrive in New York City in 63 minutes. After this, there are discussions on the part of the scientists and there is a deadly pause as the word of the ambassadors is sought to see if the missile is an attack by the Russians and if an answer is necessary. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the military are completely mixed up. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people rush to take refuge in shelters while school buses pick up millions of children (and we can see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, although watching 50's sci-fi movies seems like this is the standard ). The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man in the Pentagon announces that the missile will arrive in Ottawa, Canada, in 51 minutes! All the action mentioned happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile. Slowly it produces a plutonium charge, loads it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to place it on top of a missile. On the way, a wild driver took him out of the road, breaks down and is then kidnapped. Finally, recover the plutonium and go to the base to build the missile. Again, all this in the same time period of 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie also annoys the viewer by making it look like Ottawa could be saved, just to show roasted men, women and children. It is said then that the missile has five minutes to get to New York. The lodge continues to drive towards the base (there are 4 more miles left). Reach the base and arm the missile, then announce a two-minute countdown. All within five minutes. By the way, the neighborhoods of New York should have been scorched. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you have not guessed. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive nuclear explosion based on plutonium. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas outside of New York City and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the necessary elements to be a good B film, but it wasted them. Loggia played his character so little that you did not care that in the end he sacrificed himself. You did not care about the other characters, not even the Smarmy scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have moved the film was not physically possible in the allowed timeline (it still would not be today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very hard to find. As far as I know, it has not been reissued in any medium and for good reason. I do not know if the film should be or was a usual practice, but there is a scene in which the government sends the best scientists, military men and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are too valuable to lose. There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he plays the piano a bit. It was worse than in "27 Days," where an extraterrestrial gives five earthlings the opportunity to save or destroy the planet and does not include any blacks or Hispanics. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a special science. Fi night at Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to reappear. If you find a copy of this somewhere, you may want to put it on Amazon.com.
