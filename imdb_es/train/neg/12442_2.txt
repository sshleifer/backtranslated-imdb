The invasion of the stellar creatures would definitely be in the category "so bad that it's good" if the film was not so sexist or racist. The fact that it is so simply makes it bad. <br /> <br /> You have the same kind of stereotyped hard-line sexism you saw in Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans) that you would normally find in the thirties and forties b-westerns. In terms of not being funny, the same gag that runs through the cave is repeated more than ten times during the course of this fairly short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can not make it work for two Cagney impressions in a row, or handle a Peter Lorre when he tries). There really are no production values ​​to speak of, since the "Star Creatures" make Ro-Man from Monster Robot or Tor Johnson from Plan 9 from Outer Space look like Industrial Light and Magic creations. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of the avant-garde of what you would have to call early independent cinema ... it's not artistic enough for those theaters and it's not good enough for anything other than the last feature of a drive-in throughout the night. <Br /> <br />
