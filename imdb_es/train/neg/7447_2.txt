The first time I read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago, I loved it! It is a classic historical romance established in the 1600s when the western country was several days away from London and law and order were much harder to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The performance and production values ​​are fine, but the way the story broke down was terrible. Why do television adaptations do this? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want to change the story? One of the great mysteries of life! The BBC did an excellent version that was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s and I'm still trying to locate a copy. Follow my advice, read the book and do not bother with this insignificant version!
