Another FINE effort by the most SUBSIDERED filmmaker in the United States. His knowledge on the subject of racism is STANDARD, and IMPRESSES me on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is actually a torturous little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunely exploits the Hollywood Affirmative Action system to make inferior films is NONASTIDO, mere right-wing propaganda. The notion that Lee would resort to misuse of the current climate of political correctness in the United States to produce anti-white films full of hate is simply FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African-Americans, while repressing other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD spread by people who are AGAINST peaceful coexistence between different races. races in the United States and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in The Movie is a long dialogue from the beginning between the rich black republican and the others on the bus. The opinions presented by that man are simply INCORRECT, in all areas. 100% INCORRECT. TO HIM education IS MISSING, unlike the brilliantly INFORMED types who deserved it, they threw him off the bus. <br /> <br /> TERR√çFICAS, and an INTELLIGENT script for a visual experience that has RARELY been rivaled by any political film made since then. <br /> <br /> I also want to point out the tireless LIES that the March of the Million Men had only 80,000 people participating in it! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So, what message does Lee send here? If someone does not agree with your political views, you simply apply the violence and throw it away from the bus. I thought the movie said "Get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr. Lee is in favor of the segregation of the bus, after all, that is, it is not different from the KKK lunatics before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the line of thought of the Democratic Party. So much for "freeing the slaves" ... <br /> <br /> The final credits: "This film was financed entirely by black people". And distributed and marketed by a major Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites whom Farrakhan despises ...
