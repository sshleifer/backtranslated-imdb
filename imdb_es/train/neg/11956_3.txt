This movie sucks. I do not think I've seen a movie so shocked. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the performance was bland. This could have been a good movie. I think he just relied on his grotesque visuals. Usually, I can handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt as if Miike had shot him for firing. Only a badly executed movie. There is simply nothing to entertain watching this movie unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-milking, abuse of parents and siblings and fecal dispersal. I think I just sold the movie to a lot of you, but I meant it when I said that this sucks. He has been successful in other films, but I think it would be better if you saw someone pooping.
