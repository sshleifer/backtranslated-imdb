I loved the Batman television series and I really wanted to do it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> The reason they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I do not want to hit Burt or Adam because of the way they look now ... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in dress suits and fighting "bad guys" was a bit sad. I'd rather just watch the ex-stars make comments. The Batmobile story was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and it was left out too much. In my opinion, it was really just a quick summary. I would like to have more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same things they already knew. The Joker had a mustache under makeup and the penguin had to smoke although he hated it and was a former smoker. That was in those 2. <br /> <br /> I'd love to read the book. I'm sure he has more in this than he showed himself. Why were there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes? Where was Commissioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc., the list goes on. As I said, even those who were in this were just in it. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really corny.
