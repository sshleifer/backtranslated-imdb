Horror movies can be very fun with low budgets, bad acting and a bit of style. I think the movie just lacks a touch of grace, because, one scene dullly soothing after another, people claw into the air with inoffensive laughter. If it was not so boring, it could be fun. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can do a lot with a tired concept like "college students in a haunted house", in the same way as evil. The dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plot. The end of Hallow, unfortunately, does not do much. Actually, it's not going anywhere. He spends most of an hour configuring faceless and anonymous characters with what seems an interpersonal interminable drama. I have nothing against the development of the character, not even in a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha male, the milquetoast, the ... um ... disposable characters that exist mainly for sex scenes) . Over forty minutes without blood, the droning minutes with them were more horrible than when the bloodshed started. <br /> <br /> Well, implicit bloodshed anyway. When college students become whatever they were wearing for their haunted house (one is a vampire, one wears O.R.'s robe and a white pancake) they look pretty much like what they looked like in their haunted house amateur costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, is a masterpiece by comparison. There really is nothing to talk about, nor is there any real fear. <br /> <br /> I've thought about this from almost every approach. If it was supposed to be a tight, suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things moved so slowly), pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters invalidated it. If it was supposed to be a genuine horror film of blood and guts (which would explain the mess) ... where's the blood and guts? And anticlimax is one of the uninteresting endings of a movie I've seen. It's the kind of movie that, although it does not have a narrator through the movie, is backed up by voiceovers because all meaningless dialogues just were not enough. <br /> <br /> This was difficult. ... coming out of this, I wonder if I just watched a Christian horror movie. Maybe the "I know hell exists" of the opening was not like that, but there are some indications (or a wrong address: I'm not sure which one). For all the profanity in the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" becomes a bit absurd, and so does most of the crucifix of worship, God fearing and fearsome of satan, especially after some lusty sex scenes of T & A (a heterosexual, a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo even has a bit of resemblance to a crucifix), then this movie weighs a lot on the atheist field. An omnipotent being can not be so bad as a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
