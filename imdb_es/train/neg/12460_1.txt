We gave up at the moment when the character of George Clooney had his nails removed. We were not apprehensive: after sitting for an hour of this nonsense, we knew how he felt. To say that this movie was incomprehensible, boring and pretentious would be to overestimate it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing corner of a Pseud movie, let alone name it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as sick as we felt when we saw him. What was I thinking? Oh ... and what about those subtitles? - Did we just have a fake DVD or was the original movie made like that? Were the prayers hanging in the air? The movie was tough enough to continue without that, too. I sympathize with the cast, who obviously did everything possible with the material available.
