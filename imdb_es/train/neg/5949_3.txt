It is not uncommon to see the repetitions of foreign films in the United States, but here is the flip side. This is a horrible rethinking of the American movie "Wide Awake" of the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and fun! "Liam" on the other hand is simply weird. I must give credit to "Liam" for one thing, and that's making it clear that I made the right decision by changing my religion!
