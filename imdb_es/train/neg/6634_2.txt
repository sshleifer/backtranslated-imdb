The first look on the cover of this image, it seems like a good rock n roll movie. But do not let the cover fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The plot is just horrible, and so is acting. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a thin love story, so horrible that you see through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it were not for the music, it would have been 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least it was in 1980), and the girl who plays the Groupie is not even pretty! This movie was a big disappointment to me, because it makes many good promises.
