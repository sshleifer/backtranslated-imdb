Really a terrible movie. However, it is to be expected. Clearly a low budget: nothing so innovative, an actress (if you can call "acting" what she does) who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene, a man in a reptile costume almost modeled after a predator , a cabin in the Woods, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there are some parts that are not so regurgitated. On the one hand, the black man does not die when attacked (the first time) and is not even one of the first to die. But that is less. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist with respect to the experiments of Kat and Wes and Steve that I did not see coming. When Steve told Kat that he knew what she was doing, I believed what he had said and what Kat had said. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of the revelation. It could be due to my lack of experience with the genre, or to what is a truly intelligent turn. <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie is pretty bad and do not see it if there's something better in ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap sci-fi movie.
