The only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Ordinary. <br /> <br /> The plot about the character of Gary Sinise who tries to commit suicide is a ridiculous premise and as if it were a kind of hermit or hermit Salingerista In a hut that brings golf balls to the ocean because he could not handle the life in the lucrative professional golf community? you can mourn all you want. I wish these were my problems. I enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene in which the other member of the club in front of his father verbally abused the price of Timmy Price during the tournament is so exaggerated that I'm sorry to see him
