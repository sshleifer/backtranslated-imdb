The lethargic leadership ruins an otherwise compelling story starring the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman joining an extremist group in China in 1928, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and meets with an old lover who now works for Japan All the drama and the forward movement of the story are absorbed by the director sleepwalker style of director Ye Lou. The characters remain still looking at each other for long minutes, without saying anything, the handheld cameras sustain forever faces that show endless reactions for longer than necessary, the editions repeat that the same reaction is triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters when the story begins and we are given little new information as the story progresses, only the silence and the static shots of the lovers who do not speak, who interact through silent dances but do not share apparent emotional intimacy A film that induces a lot of sleep.
