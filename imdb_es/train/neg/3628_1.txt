The dream of an art expert. Overrated, overrated, exaggerated; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve the Best Film of 1951 on its own merits, but was dwarfed by competition from the beginning. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello meet the invisible man; Whatever it is, if it came out in '51, it's better than this crapola artillery. The closing ballet is a trap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less capable (in acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 Worst of '51 (I saw 201 films), and among the 5 winners of the Oscar for Best Film.
