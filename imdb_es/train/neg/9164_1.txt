I should start with this by saying that I am a great romantic. Therefore, I really wanted like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt when I saw it. The Leap Years tells the story full of Li-Ann's destinies, who falls in love with Jeremy and commit to meet each leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that does not seem to be watching another movie by Jack Neo. Then, why, oh, why is it so bad? First of all, I feel that the filmmakers thought they were recording a music video, because they chose to replace the narrative and any real emotion with cheesy mounts, predictable actions and clich√© lines. I am annoyed and embarrassed to have been one of the first in Singapore to see The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled moans in the cruel performances spoke a lot. My hope was to see a romantic movie that surpassed Forever Fever, the best romantic comedy in Singapore so far, and The Leap Years is not even close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years, which is hard but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or your emotions like I did. The movie will make you give up love forever.
