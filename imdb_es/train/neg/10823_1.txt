I do not like to use the word "horrible" to describe any film work that takes a lot of time, effort, talent and money in its creation, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt the novel by Charlotte BrontÃ« 'Jane Eyre' is a A total loss of time. <br /> <br /> The script lacks finesse and power, everything is explained to the viewer in clear terms, leaving little to the imagination. The main actors are unfortunately badly, clearly hired by their star names, and the musical score drippy and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other. It's like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of minimal emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt acts the whole movie in a single tone and that tone is flat and without energy. Of course, the loose and lazy script does not help any of these actors, otherwise excellent, in their efforts to bring a touch of life to this film. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax by Joan Plowright is like a Disney creation that keeps popping up to sweeten the scenes in which it would have been better to leave her out. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the possible second wife, played as a Barbie doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty number. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very big actress, is completely wasted like Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed. She would have been better chosen as Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as the beloved teacher of Jane's school, evokes genuine sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I watched this version of 'Jane Eyre' after watching Robert Young for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an explosive nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> Now I will be interested to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I have read some very good Things on this website. I'm surprised how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire photo book. <br /> <br /> Above all I can say about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography of vivid colors, beyond that, is a complete failure.
