Think of a darker version of one of those children's shows like "Power Rangers" and you'll have this 1990 movie, "Robot Jox." A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and the one who leaves his country wins. The robots are huge and seem slightly better versions of those programs, mainly because they are less colorful, so although this movie is not good, it is not so bad to see it. There are, as I recall, two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final confrontation. There is a twist of the plot halfway through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end, the plot is nothing that will stay with you for a period of time after the end of the image. The fights themselves seem like giant toys in the uproar, but they're still something fun to watch. This movie would also generate a couple of other movies with similar plot devices, such as giant robots and the tournament. So it's worth taking a look once, but probably no more than that.
