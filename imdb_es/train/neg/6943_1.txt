This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime, but when he acts as revenge, there is a video camera that points to him all the time. What man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> The fact that this script could never happen, except with someone who can not get dressed. I destroyed it for me, but it became more foolish! <br /> <br /> I'm thinking that the writers have some serious habits: to cook their brain cells and make them lose the holes in the plot, you can drive a battalion of armored tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: a man seeks revenge for the death of his loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong, and then the unexpected develops. <br /> <br /> If only these people who wrote this story had not been foolish enough to write totally unreal plot twists that could never happen this way. To the writers, I say: seek help for your serious mental problem.
