['Even if one did not realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and died before the premiere of the film, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful to watch. Supposedly it is a labyrinth of the famous oriental villain of Sax Rohmer, but it lacks focus. The potential for satirical comments on the anti-oriental nuances of the Rohmer concept is ignored. In fact, the film uses racist insults. There are almost no real jokes or jokes, only actors who mostly behave idiotically and spit sad lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spit curses and racial slurs for trying to laugh. Most other actors are also embarrassed. <br /><br /> And then there&#39;s Peter Sellers. Play the double role of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to invent a formula to recover his youth and his unconditional British enemy Nayland Smith. The sellers are not one hundred percent bad; he conveys an extravagant warmth like Smith when he talks about his fetish attachment to his lawn mower and strangely misses himself as Manchu when he expresses his love for entertainment in the English music room. But most of the time, he plays both roles with an expression of tiredness, further sabotaging any comic possibility. Vendors&#39; routines where they revitalize their fading strength with electric shocks are particularly unbearable; It seems too convincingly agonizing to be funny. <br /><br /> A few genuinely ingenious lines, a good slapstick bitten by Burt Kwouk (Cato in the PINK PANTHER movies) as one of Manchu&#39;s henchmen, and the funny musical numbers of Helen Mirren can not save this mess. If someone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comic genius, they will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.']
