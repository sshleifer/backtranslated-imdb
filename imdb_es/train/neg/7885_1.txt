I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies. When I want a sermon, I go to church, but I do not want one from a movie. I do not care about some supernatural themes (after all, religion is the most supernatural thing you can get!), But this movie had so much preaching that it bothered me a lot. The landlady reminded me of the witches they had seen in other movies. The bad boy even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a silly ending: the hero entered the meeting and shouted at all those elders, and that broke the spell. If life were so simple. I think that when the movies are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREDICTION CONTAINED HERE!
