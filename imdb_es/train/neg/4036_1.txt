Almost from the beginning, this film is poor and lacks conviction, but again most people would have difficulty showing a commitment to such an uninspiring script as this one. The dialogue does not really flow and sometimes, as in this case, more is less (or should have been). This is also supported by strange scenes (eg, Cemetry's slow-motion walk) that you think could lead somewhere but seem to waste a few more seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange The combination of comedy gangster / situation that I'm sure seemed like a good idea at the time, but if there was ever a case for someone who needs to be honest with the scriptwriter, here I was. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is fine but then he seems to have a character who always plays, so I start to wonder if he was given a script or if he was filmed and told to react in the usual way. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. This reminds me of the Python quote (I think) about Shakespere, about his "comedies": if he had wanted it to be humorous, he would have made a joke. Well, I did not see one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, I did it because I was seeing it with a friend and I was hoping it would get better. <br /> <br /> He did not.
