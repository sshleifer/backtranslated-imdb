It makes no sense near a group of half-naked men who slap each other and hit each other. That's. For about 5 minutes we see this. It is shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the rhythm of the terrible music. It seems interesting but there is no plot and, in reality, the violence inherent in this became disturbing. Also the homo eroticism in this is played but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material may like this, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (occasionally) annoying. Really, what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a gay shorts festival and the audience sat in stunned silence. I really wish I could go below 1.
