IT CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT THE DOUBT CAN BE LONGEN OUT! <br /> <br /> Five Through the eyes can be summed up in one word ... Amateur. This movie tries to make it better to be different from most movies by the type of film 'Blair Witch' ... it does not work ... it just looks and feels like someone has a cheap video camera, a van and I decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist has no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian in a suit of power compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... only the sounds of screams and cries. The whole movie takes place inside a van, which means that a decent scenario is out of the question. The five girls really do the best they can with what they have been given, but in general they look like quite terrible actresses ... although with the material given it is difficult to judge if they can really help ... they spend the whole movie screaming, screaming and moaning ... so much that half the time it's hard to understand what was said and the cameras are so bad that it's really hard to say who said it. This video is painted like a violent torture movie, but in reality it's only five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ... then we come to the end after what seem like 5 hours of constant screaming and the five girls are still alive ... with one finger less. The only thumbs up (do it ... finger ... LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after doing this terrible movie. Do not judge this by the poster ... you will be very disappointed.
