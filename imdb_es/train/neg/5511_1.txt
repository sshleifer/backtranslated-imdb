I must agree with the first comment: this movie is very, very bad. Despite having a very large B-list cast, the cover of this movie (for those who are not watching it on Comedy Central for a day of the week, which is probably the only exposure that this movie will have) tries to blame Dangerfield, but it's really just a paycheck for every 80s comedian. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? Now you can say that Maximum Overdrive was not your only horrible movie: double verification. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movie is that it was written lazily with jokes already told. None of this movie out of its existence is funny. You are better off seeing the dry paint. Definitely, this is something that is based directly on the scraping of the bottom of the barrel and that is still believed in the old adage of video: throw a star of yesteryear on the cover and you will get some rent money. . Keeping in mind that video rental days are changing, consider this one of the last examples of taking out garbage. <br /> <br /> The only use this movie has is if you have trouble falling asleep. It will take you there.
