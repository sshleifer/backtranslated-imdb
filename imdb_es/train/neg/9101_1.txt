This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark". Eliminate the language and themes of "we are not the bad guys" and will be left with the dialogue and devices of the plot that insult the intelligence of anyone who does not describe "Saved by the Bell" as quality television. The dialogue, so ridiculously clich√©d and knowingly dirty, one might think that the script was the product of locking up Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszter in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of all the bad scripts that each had participated in the creation. If that was the intention of Roger Kumble, mission accomplished.
