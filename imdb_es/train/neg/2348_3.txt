Ashley Judd, in a first role and I think her first leading role, shows her rebellious nature in real life in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being an unconditional feminist in real life, you must have appreciated this script. No wonder left-wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; It is also in its political alley. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I'm glad Judd has risen from this moronic fight to better roles in entertaining movies, not preaching the hard-line liberal agenda.
