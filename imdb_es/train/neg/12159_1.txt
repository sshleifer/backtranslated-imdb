I can not believe I really saw this, but I guess I just wanted to know if this movie would unwittingly become more fun towards the end. And he did. the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defense attorney, so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was too strange. Nobody on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst fiscal on earth. Why was he in court anyway? He did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. A simple search of your house would have resulted in the finding of the rings. but it is not necessary to go preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during all the judgment, that was everything. The blonde lunatic was given a real drug to prove she was innocent, but not Brett. the lunatic almost had a Brett altar in her house that could have shown her sickly obsession. But again, do not go. During the court scene, I felt the silent urge to take the tip of the needle from his hand and hit it several times against his head. even the weirdos do not seem as foolish as they are fake "I'm innocent" as she did. And what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, her husband will be sent to jail, guilty or not. the evil, the evil of men.
