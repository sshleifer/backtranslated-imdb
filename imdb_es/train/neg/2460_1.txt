I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. Consistently, it seems that it was written and performed by secondary school children for a school project, and that is also the level at which the humor seems to be directed. There is no subtlety and, more damned for a mockumentary, it never feels like a documentary. And while the lines are not fun in the first place, an attempt at delivery in a dead place would have helped, certainly, anything would be better than the exaggerated exaggeration to which we are subject. <br /> <br /> I 'recommend this to people who like' comedies' in the vein of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; People who think that words like "butt" are intrinsically hysterical. Other people should stay away and not waste time.
