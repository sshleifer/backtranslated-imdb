Seeing "Der himmel über Berlin" when I was a teenager in the late 80's was a profound experience for me, "so this is what movies could be". Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the end of the world," it still holds a special place in my heart and in my mind, a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, later years have seen it. a steady decline in the quality of their work with "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" reaching a terrible low point. No more captivating images or music. There is no search or sample of great vision. All that remains are characters and political statements little veiled, which are reduced to nothing more than clichés, and frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Has the well dried up? Whatever the reason, it is time for Mr. Wenders to intensify or stop it altogether.
