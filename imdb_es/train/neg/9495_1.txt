This is a terrible movie, and no scene has an ounce of real emotion. The characters are not inflexible, they are obviously drawn, they are predictable and the story line is obvious and the typical fulfillment of Hollywood desires. <br /> <br /> William Holden (very sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when this movie was made, but he is playing with someone in his 40s and it looks like he is in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and it was programmed to find it irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. <br /> <br /> The character of Holden: the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (no) Coincidentally, he is placed with obvious elements of the 60s and the hippie is great: high school, high fidelity , the lunches at Yamashiro. But the movie is ridiculously unusual, a tinkling of old nebulae desperately wanting the free spirits they saw at Sunset and Laurel Canyon to find them sexy and their great cars very attractive cars. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture was never so desperate. And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth that he took this embarrassing part.
