Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were about (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And I realized that I had witnessed 26 episodes that consisted mainly of the characters' own hatred, Selfishness and self-pity Actually, switch between alien / robot fights and these dark and depressing scenes that blink and turn off, where one or more characters can simply say or shout "I hate you / I / I do it" 10-12 times in a row. <Br /> <br /> I can not really see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing, actually). I wanted to kick them and tell them to have a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling did not change during the last ones. Shinji really possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an enraged know-it-all that he wanted to break the television screen every time he appeared. Oh, and more than anyone, these two hate everything, and they say it very often. <br /> <br /> For the rest, I'm a big fan of anime and manga, and I've never had such a dislike before. I read that the creator / writer of the series wrote this while suffering from depression, and I can believe it; It depressed me to see it. Is that the goal of this series? Honestly, I'm asking. Is it designed to confuse and annoy the viewer? And if you suffer from depression, why not write a book or a biography about it, instead of mixing it with aliens and wicks? This alien war plot, from what I could see, does not lead anywhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, as I am really fascinated by the number of people who claim to love this mosaic of plots with no way out, I can not help, but I wonder how many of them really find it right and how many say they do it because they have been told yes.
