This movement reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think that's always the story of Crypt. The same goes for the bad performance. Very bad performance. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people did not like it and that I did not expect much. Every time I watch a Stephen King movie, I do not expect much because all his films are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie worked as if it were a true story and the whole book is a lot of reports and theories and so on. It was so good But I noticed that the two novels were not like the movies. The endings were very different from the movie versions. I suppose that from those two novels all his novels have changed a lot and the endings are always corny. The end of Thinner is the worst. Very Cheesy. I want to read the book to discover the real ending. I suggest to all those who try to read Stephen King's novels to watch their films beforehand so that they can compare them. And in that way you will be very satisfied in the book. I intend to do it with all his novels that became movies. I'm sure if they turned into movies, they were really good books ... and the script went terribly wrong.
