As a big fan of the Cracker series, I've been waiting for 7 years for the next addition. I am afraid that this episode is simply not up to the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters' wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation where a soldier, tormented by flash backs from his period of service in Northern Ireland, leaves of partying <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way in which everything is set up and how the killer is taken. Everything is fat or implausible. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good scenes in Flash backs from Northern Ireland that were shot wonderfully.
