I checked this on DVD for a dollar to be able to smile easily while this terrible movie unfolds. Every time you think it can not get worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrible. The plot does not make any sense at all. The title "Cold Revenge" on the US DVD version UU It has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first shot. There are many errors during the dialogues that indicate that there is no intention to make another shot to at least try to make this film bearable. I do not remember seeing a worse movie and, from time to time, I have bad films, well, except for the unstoppable one with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I cheating, although it is bad, Unspeakable deserves the awards for Best Film at the Oscars compared to this garbage.
