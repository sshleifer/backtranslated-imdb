After reading the other comments about this movie, I would like to share my own opinion that this is a hard movie to watch unless you are a total Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> When viewed by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undisturbed neuroses than can be absorbed all at once. It is quite difficult to see. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so unfriendly and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to him, let alone root him while he stumbles from a situation of dysfunctional self-absorption to the next. And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have so much exposed foliage and he was supposed to turn on a baby like Kathryn Harrold, unless, of course, it's Albert Brooks in a production controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its funny moments ----- but they are fragmentary and infrequent. Most of the time, I felt like I was on a trip confined to a completely unpleasant person and wishing it was over. It confirms the problems that can arise when you put too much control of a movie on one person, someone who lacks self-discipline to be able to go back and see what happens clearly. <br /> <br /> As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this movie, is in fact what he portrayed. Six years later, he chose Albert Brooks on the hit "Broadcast News." James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic. Albert allowed us to see James (usually not interpreted as an actor) doing a funny comic turn in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will have gone on to the next complimentary comment. About that I tell you: there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie intended as entertainment.
