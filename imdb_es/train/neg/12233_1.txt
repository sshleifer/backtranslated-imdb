I just do not see how a Concorde-New Horizons movie directed by Jim Wynorski and with the talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just stuns the mind, does not it? <br /> <br /> Well, make no mistake about it. "Munchie Strikes Back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has existed for many centuries. For reasons that are not fully explained until the end of the film, they send him to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has a balloon payment on her mortgage in two weeks ... for a not-so-small sum of $ 20,000. Oh. She can not get the money because she has just been fired. OK ... JUST is the key word in that sentence. What...? Was I planning to pay it with a single paycheck? Maybe it would have been a good idea to have spent the last few years saving for it ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to those that a genius would possess ... but it is not a limit on the amount of desires you can do! Munchie gives the boy a lot of elegant things for one night, but then the boy asks him to send him back to the mall that Munchie "borrowed" from him. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Unfortunately, those foolish parents who watch the game do not think it's totally strange. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to finish this because this has already exhausted enough of my life force as it is. The scene in which Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, will kick a dog that is hitting her. Your heart will melt at its charm when you notice that the dollar bills flutter in your front yard and wonder how it could be snowing during the summer. The credits of "Munchie Strikes Back" promised that it would follow another film titled, "Munchie Hangs Ten". To date, the public that sees the film has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. Heh 1/10
