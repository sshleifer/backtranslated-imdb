This film can be judged from three points of view: as a story, as Amin's profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as a story, mentions when approving the coup d'Ã©tat that rejected Obote, the expulsion of Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as background, but not in a coherent chronological framework. <br /> <br /> As Amin's profile may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this were a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He got it, which proves that Oscar voters do not see the movies they vote for). Ignore the relevant historical episodes of the novel, which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the doctor's point of view. Instead, he tells the fictional story of the Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from Amin's point of view. But the story told is the only incident of which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> Like a fiction thriller, there is no argument to keep it together. The beginning is tense: take cinematographic freedoms with the novel, but configure the story. The character of the doctor is well defined, but is lost in the second half of the film that suffers. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala if he is badly explained, seduced by power? Why he befriends no one is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the adventure instead of the black doctor: an absurd entanglement that does not seem far from believable, but allows the writers of the film to show Amin's ferocity up close. . The man called Pedacito de Caballo at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda drove to the left, not to the right, the license plates were three letters and two or three numbers, and where are the equatorial fangs? <br /> <br /> In short, if you've never heard of Amin, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's performance, but the last hour will lead you into confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book, do not watch the movie, it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so reckless, it was not.
