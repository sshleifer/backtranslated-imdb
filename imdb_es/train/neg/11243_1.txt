In summary, this movie has no value. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a film from the point of view of what someone from the beginning of the 20th century might think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of a story or convincing characters prevents us from suspending our disbelief, so the idea simply fails. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the whole movie was made with actors in front of green screens and we're supposed to be impressed. But as a graphics person, the excess smoothing was an obvious crutch to hide the difficult problem of the sharp edge with the green screen. The color is eliminated mainly without any relevant effect, except to reduce the visual quality. And I do not understand why anyone would consider anything represented in this film to be innovative. In any case, the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar of really bad graphics: they are not up to the old graphics of the Jurassic Park. The models for the robots were so simple, simple and very unattractive. There was a group of rare prehistoric animals on that island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, beyond belief. In fact, I can not believe I did not come out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is not motivated and, throughout the film, is based on distrust and deception. Why is the character of Morris Paley even there? We are not convinced in any way that Joe is heroic; I mean, an airplane flies and saved a person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why are we supposed to worry about Joe wanting to save him? Who were the Nepalease who locked Joe and Polly in the vault of the mine, and why would they do it (remembering that the whole Totenkopf operation was robotic)? <br /> <br /> Making a hole: (1) Why did the Bai Ling character (A great fall from his excellent character in "The Crow") stop the robots that had captured Joe? They were looking for the vials, and they had not found them. (2) Why the hell would they capture Dex but not kill him (he does not even know about the vials, and the bad guys did not know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and, therefore, to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that "they" do not know anything about Totenkopf, however, she has a secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete file in the style of the FBI. (4) The blank space on the map as described by the Nepalese: if they know everything about this mysterious area, why the hell is your map blank in that place? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they burn). Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes. However, Polly is forced to wear a bulky dress that looks very strange. Suddenly, in the same continuity line, Polly recovers her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far am I supposed to change my brain to see this shit? <br /> <br /> We're supposed to be excited about the overproduction of music, even when there's nothing interesting or remotely exciting on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And the performance? Are we supposed to be impressed with a lot of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (he does not have a single line). The dialogue was not camping, and not even going up to the level of cheese. It is simply bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or convincing; They are the kind of people with whom I would try to ignore or disassociate if I ever had the misfortune of knowing them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has a higher than average rating here. IMDb. In my humble opinion I should be competing with "Batman Forever" in the last 100 of all time.
