I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographies and dances in it ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama ... no, the performance was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a serious and quality actor? Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time keeping awake through this disconnected movie. The message about apartheid and the "tribute" to students who died during a student uprising is noted. But as entertainment it was very poor and like a documentary movie it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but to be fair, I hated it
