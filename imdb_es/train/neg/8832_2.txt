I had a hard time making this move. It was extremely slow and, at times, he wondered when the plot of the movie would really come alive. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to flow slowly and I kept wondering when it was going to end. I am usually a person who likes a good indie file from time to time, but this did not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they tried to do a lot with this movie. At one point he seemed to become a politician and I'm not a big fan of movies. If you are looking for a slow motion movie with little or no plot, this is the right film for you. As for me, I felt that I lost 2 hours when I could have been doing something else.
