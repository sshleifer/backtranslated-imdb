I hate being the one that will rain in a parade (even a small one like this) but from the first scene, you could say that this movie was going to be absolute shit. It's really a shame, because I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued by the way they would mix in a movie, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat this: the two main actors (who are side by side on the billboards and the DVD covers) did not have a scene together. They did not talk and they never appeared on the screen at the same time. It almost sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertising <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, all the characters in the film were not realistic and seemed nonhuman. The scenarios were very far-fetched, the plot was shit, jokes were scarce, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor man Tim from the office), nobody was nice, and worst of all, some of the Characters were so annoying because they almost forced me to turn off, since I could not see them or hear them anymore. <br /> <br /> This stinking budget was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could not inject some humor and charm into this, but bless, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How someone could qualify this movie as 'ten stars' surpasses me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on ... I will not even give some of the big stars ten stars, since ten stars imply that a movie was perfect. This movie was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means that it was almost completely terrible in everything. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you want, but if you've seen many movies and seen many. great movies, your opinion will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
