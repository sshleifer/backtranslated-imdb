The interaction between the characters is a moral disaster. In the end, you dislike most of the characters and do not especially like any of them. <br /> <br /> Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really do not care at all. About them. The movie has no plot, no direction or purpose. The only redeeming quality of the film was to treat it as a look at the lives in disrepair of some losers, and that is not as stimulating as a waste of the afternoon.
