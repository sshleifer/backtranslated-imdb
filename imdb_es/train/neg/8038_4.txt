** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher movie that makes no sense with a killer running and dressed in a black robe and what looks like a rubber mask by Peter Lorre. At the beginning of the film, almost the first scene, we were told that young Beth Morgan was in rehab due to excessive drug use after her boyfriend was killed at Tennyson College about a year ago. <br /> <br /> That daughter of the FBI agent (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with capturing the murderer, was also published, her daughter was also killed in Tennyson at about the same time. When the movie "Do you want to know a secret?" Is over, is it never explained what those two killings in Connecticute have to do with the killing in Florida of half a dozen collage students a year later? Apart from that the murderer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly Halloween costume. <br /> <br /> On Spring Break in the Sunshine State, the six students spend their vacations in a house on the beach and, before they know it, they start being beaten one by one. Starting with computer fan Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the murder even spread to the city with a number of people who have nothing to do with the target student, including Gavin Police Chief Jack McGee, who was cut off . <br /> <br /> The masked assassin saves Beth for the end in this strange ceremony in a deserted church, in what looks like the Florida Everglades. Finally, it reveals who is his and what his intentions are, which makes as much sense as the movie, none. Trying to scare your audience, all the movie does is confuse and disconcert with a series of scenes not too convincing. The most effective that have the victim, Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts in his life and end, along with Agent Sacker, the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a vicious cut at the foot of a large splinter of glass that almost broke him in half and paralyzed him, but then miraculously recovered, after being arrested for a murder he did not commit In fact, he had it twice more with the killer, not as much as having a slight limp in his walk! Did not it make sense at all why Oz and Beth left on their own to attack and catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cell phone that Oz had, instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses her head for her, in the Hank Ford movie, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing, as are the two girls at the beach house. They together with Beth Oz end up being victims of the murderers and then disappearing in some way from the sight! For a moment he did not know if they were really killed or if it was some kind of hallucination on the part of Oz or the local police. Until the final scene outside the wall where they appeared in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get an idea of ​​a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting unpleasantly, trying to get it. with Hank while Beth enters without Hank and Tina noticing. That seemed to have bothered Beth even more than her boyfriend was killed at the beginning of the movie!
