This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and that Durant had not returned again. Also, there were actually some indications of character development when it came to the bad guy's family and Darkman himself. This made my heart soften and I gave this film until 4/10, that is, ** / *****.
