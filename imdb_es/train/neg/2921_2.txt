The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by his aesthetic queen aunt Estee Lauder. His aunt (by marriage, we can assume) is trying to locate his lost family in Europe. All they have to do is a picture of a young woman standing next to an ornate music box. The researcher goes to Europe and searches in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenario is real and actually filmed in the place (unlike an Assassination, she wrote where Jessica is supposed to visit a distant place and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, meet a young man who is also looking to solve his own family mystery and come together to track clues and threaten the bad guys. Dialogue, particularly romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw it through the landscape, but the script was so bad that I was left alone to see if it got worse. Did. The performance was also out of the game. I can see why Mel Harris's career never took off after thirty-some years, but it's adequate (although it seems too old for his co-star). But, the support players are directly outside the gambling house of the community. I also lost count of how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? I realized in the middle of the movie that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and, of course, it is. I guess that says it all.
