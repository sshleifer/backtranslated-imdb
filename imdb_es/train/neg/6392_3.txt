Goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis fans should look elsewhere if they are collecting this film to see their usual spilling blood cubes, since there is very little bleeding in this movie. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell the strange story, relying on the special effects of the basement bargain on a budget that could have probably doubled if the cast had taken out their pockets for the change one day. Oddly enough, while it is cheap and very badly performed (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total extravagance of the plot keeps the attention at all times. Imagine how this movie could have been on a decent budget! In general, varieties for the tastes of champagne on a beer budget.
