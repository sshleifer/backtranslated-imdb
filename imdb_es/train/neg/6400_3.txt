The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from the plot, the weak script, the grim acting and the ridiculous continuity when editing this mess together. It has very few memorable moments, but the well dries quickly. As a child, I remember this as Luke's vehicle for the two comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was transmitted in each scene and how this relates to the plot in general. Seeing it again after many years, it screams daze. I'm not so worried about the racial controversy, since I would not mind seeing a film approach that subject with a little lightness. The most obvious flaw for me is that the scenes are arranged as a confusing and unrelated series of comedy bits of 2 minute situations (some not very good in that sense), which were stapled together by the editor after dark in The local water well. The characters change their feelings and motivations on a dime, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and within scenes, making them feel as if no one had any idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was a gem to begin with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
