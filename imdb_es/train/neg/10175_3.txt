I could not go to sleep the other night. So I got up, I put on the tube and this movie was on. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers bit more than they could chew. As ambitious in its scope as it was "Forrest Gump". But Gump read like a fairy tale where an extraordinarily fortunate man guides us through the era. TGMB only relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical in which the actors have to ruin it. The purpose of each character was to fill an archetype of the 60s. <br /> <br /> See how we are presented to Finnegan: hugging his black maid and receiving a framed photo of MLK. Criminey, talk about a strong hand. Why not just give him a shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Is not love free Groovay, man? Oh no, I did not have my period." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA." Uh, sorry. The 60s were not square at all. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we only heard this regret for not going there. <br /> <br /> I can not even remember the name of the black child. He was just a support used to show how racially tolerant the other children are. <br /> <br /> The thing is that period pieces do not have to be so cheesy. Take "Dazed & Confused." See how they present us to the hero of football, Randall Floyd. We do not see it first on the football field. In fact, we never see him play football. We are introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker friends to a party. <br /> <br /> In the "dazed", feminism is not a casual by-product of a chick that runs over. It is much more organic, more serious than that. It has been refined in the ladies' room in a discussion on Gilligan Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane environments. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here indicate that the themes of this film are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this piece of Baby-Boomer porn.
