After having seen this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to browse it, but after reading the other comments, I have no heart. Clearly this is a movie that has worked very well for children of a certain age. Well, let me not be a complete Grinch; it might still work for some children, if they are not too saturated with media and have not become visually sophisticated, for example. To see all LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you're an adult, stay miles away; you will not enjoy it <br /> <br /> The interesting details: Barbara Kellerman as the witch, especially in her early scenes with Edmund, creates the perfect combination of charismatic evil and restricted madness. (On the Stone Table, she passes a little above.) Michael Aldridge in the supporting role of Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry, since Mr. Tumnus also has the kind of polished and skillful performance we would expect from the best BBC dramas And the disguise of Aslan works very well, surprisingly well considering. They got right in the eyes. <br /> <br /> The bad parts: almost everything else, but two areas in particular. One, the casting. England is full of good actors and contains tens of thousands of British school attractions. How could they have finished with these four stiffs? They move like wooden soldiers and talk about them too. Peter has no gravitas or charisma (and is visibly shorter than his supposedly smaller brothers); Edmund is just querulous; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatic, visible and drastically wrong in this part that I can not imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two, the animal costumes. Once again, it seems that they worked for some children. If the children are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting and believable characters, this movie could be fascinated. But for a viewer with the sophistication of, say, a 12-year-old boy who has seen Prisoner Of Azkaban. When Mr. Beaver comes out from behind that tree, there will be cries of cruel and mocking laughter. The costumes just do not work, I could not, and I think that any adult or modern teenager could not, suspend disbelief when he looked at Mister Beaver. The animation drawn later (taps, etc.) works better, it is easier to take. <br /> <br /> Therefore: ten stars for the younger and tender of soul; all the others read, or reread the book and see the best movie that unfolds in your imagination.
