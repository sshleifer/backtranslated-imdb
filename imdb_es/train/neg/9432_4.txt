"Unhinged" is a strange little film, a forgotten film about the golden age of the genre. It is difficult to really write a satisfactory review of this movie simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. The plot is quite exaggerated: three young women on their way to a rock concert face a car accident and end up stranded in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize that something is not right when they hear strange breaths and noises from the attic. Besides that, the mother and the daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, since they fight intensely in front of their guest at dinner. The old mother even calls her daughter bitch and whore and accuses her of harassing the boys at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the movie, when a girl finally decides that it is better to go for help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the "leader" girl. It is almost incredible to hear them deliver their lines in the same tone of wood throughout the film. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The movie is also quite boring in parts and really, really creeps. The murders are horrifying, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as mentioned here, the movie really earns points with its brilliant and disturbing ending. It comes totally from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp" of the camp. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from a horrible and boring performance, a boring rhythm. The isolated, spooky-looking mansion and dark, premonitory lighting give the film a grainy realism, but it quickly breaks down when one of the characters tries to act. It may be worth it if you can keep it until the end, but I tell you it will go faster in the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
