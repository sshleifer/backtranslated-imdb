A "new" columbo without inspiration and without distinctions that sees the man in the mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his girlfriend to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates ... <br /> <br /> And that's what it's about: drawing indifferently and surprisingly loaded with a flat script, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote the very pleasant story of Columbo "Murder Under Glass "at the apogee of the detective; There is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity that Columbo gave to the scriptwriter is the reduction of the suspects through the photos taken at the wedding, which include everyone who was there! <br /> <br /> Despite every possible Columbo trait, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with the appropriate performance of the telenovela. Very avoidable things.
