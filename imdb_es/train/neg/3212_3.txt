I'm a big fan of the comic series, but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I expected the 2000 Heavy Metal to feel a little ... slow, bad dialogue, a lot of blood ... but this was worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the comic book line, but the positive points practically stop there. The characters do not have the energy or the spirit that caught my attention in the comic series. The film only covers a small part of the comic, and the part used is slower and boring than the backs. The focus in the film is on insignificant events instead of the most interesting general plot of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Unfortunately, it was not like that, so now there is another terrible movie that few will see and much less will love. My copy will surely accumulate dust for years until I finally throw it away.
