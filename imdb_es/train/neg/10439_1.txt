I would like to think that I am a very open-minded guy and it costs me a lot (!) That I do not like a movie, but this is undoubtedly one of the strangest and the worst movies I've ever seen. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what is wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually quite reliable when it comes to ratings) ... the only thing I can imagine is that the People must have voted during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While they were being dragged by the head / stoned out of their minds 2. They have received cash for the votes 3. Under the gun point <br /> <br /> I can not believe I lost a good 1h45 min of my life for this Pathetic excuse for a movie.
