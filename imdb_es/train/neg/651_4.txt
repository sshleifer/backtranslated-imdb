I saw this movie a few days ago and jumped happily during the scary parts. I must admit that I found it quite decent ... until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Your boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit guy, does not make any sound while being killed. Do not you think he could have tried at least to kill the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the observation is made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa", I almost shouted on the screen. When your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with HER, you do not comment like that if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle realizes that there may be danger in the future, would not it be clever that Donna, her boyfriend, her Aunt and her uncle get into a car? Drive far, far away, then prime the house with the HRT and the police force so that the murderer has no way to leave? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And in. And in. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters did not have enough profile for you to feel empathy when they were killed and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good for teenagers or young couples looking for a fun night. If you do not consider all the nonsense, it's a mediocre movie.
