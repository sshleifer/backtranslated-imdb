What a disappointment! I hated the mummy but it was even worse! It was very exhausting and incredible and at some point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can not believe that people liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a great tour of the most sought after buildings in the United States. The uninterrupted flow of suggestions and combinations was also not very convincing. I stopped paying attention around 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night turned into a total disappointment. What a drag ... I think I just watched too many movies to enjoy National Treasure.
