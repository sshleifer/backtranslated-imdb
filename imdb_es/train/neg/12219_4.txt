This was a weird movie. It started pretty well. A solid sound track behind flash images of blood and chaos when our psycho did his thing. <br /> <br /> Then comes his "fall". Here I could say that I expected a movie "B" really cheesy. Acting badly, I mean how difficult it is to hold a gun and act like a policeman. These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath, we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... <br /> <br /> From this moment on it is bad to act big tits, the occasional bucket of blood and scenes of wrong death done. <br /> <br /> That said, I gave the film a four because despite its flaws it kept a kind of chill that I could not get rid of completely. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it Film, but I have to admit that I have seen worse.
