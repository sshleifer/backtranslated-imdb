Okay, I must say that before the revelation of the 'monster'. saying that he really did not fit into that category, just a weird thing that had an annoying squeak! And personally I think a grandmother could have escaped from that thing, but anyway. In fact, I was getting into this movie, although the main character, a drunk and a heroin addict, was not an appeal. But scenes like when she escapes from the train, and you can see that the figure on the door was a bit creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster unleashed the moment the monster was revealed, it simply became your average horror, with limited emotions or fear. Little by little I got bored more and I wanted to put out the thing. I like that most people have said that I was encouraging homeless people to do it, especially the boy, who gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie really could have been something special instead of becoming what the other horrors of today are! Just boring and well not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a meaningless gore fest (which is limited, almost none in fact) by all means, give it a go, but for all of you, the viewers Serious of horror look elsewhere, much better movies out there.
