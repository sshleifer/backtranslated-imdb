The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who gets involved with scammers is so formal that I have to assume that was the desired intention. The sets are artificial and I never felt that I was watching a movie. It seemed that the actors were only reading their lines, instead of answering between them. While the film has elements of the first black film (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Since the presentation had not appealed to me, at least I expected an attractive story. Usually, I'm pretty slow when it comes to stories with twists in the plot, but you can see what comes here in the first fifteen minutes. At the time of "Wow, I forgot the $ 80,000", I thought to myself that this is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with declared experience in gambling addictions, behaving so stupidly is irrelevant. If at any time she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
