I love seeing Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this poor excuse for a soft-core porn movie is unnecessarily offensive, lacks something similar to wit and serves simply as a self-promotional vehicle for Springer. Although it lasts about 90 minutes, the film is horribly prolonged, and I should have had the common sense to leave. Simply atrocious
