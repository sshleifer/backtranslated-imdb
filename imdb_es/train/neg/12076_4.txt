You all know the story of "Hamlet". I make. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "To be or not to be" (not the speech itself) has been hit on the floor so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact, it was not so good). to get started). In FACT, I find "Hamlet" a good work but very overrated. It is not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not far behind. "Macbeth (bangs your table, removes the drawers, Puck will recover, OW!)" It's not that bad either. There are many others who are better than this by Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not really comment too much on the film, but I will dissect the absolutely horrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Good. . Mike and the Bots win a card game, they can choose the movie. . . They ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and prepare for the most boring science fiction episode of MST3K (it's true, I have not seen any of the CC Ones). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes the visualization of that horrible Episode, since it is not really a film, but united random scenes (I remember the line of Mike of "Future War": " Maybe this is an anthology of short films without frames "), the team of SOL Crew a Lot came out of many good cracks. I can not say the same here. <br /> <br /> The riffs do not work, the host segments (usually) are, at best, mediocre, and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is BETTER ( I mean, like a quality movie, not like a camp, like "Prince of Space") than the MST3K version, you know the program must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw him was several months ago), maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried And I tried to entertain myself, but I could not. Just the occasional line, like "Hail the boss of Queen Dilbert!" (and when that's the funniest line of the episode, well, ahem), and occasionally, I mean every ten minutes or so, maybe even my laugh. The second time I tried to see it, I did not even laugh at the few jokes I had found funny before, and I just gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie is not horrible; It's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although dubbing is not the best, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY WHY, MST3K!
