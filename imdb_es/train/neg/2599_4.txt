I got the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and that's probably the only constellation in which this movie could interest anyone. <br /> <br /> One of the first Drew movies, it looks very good and it looks pretty many really nice scenes of it, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a lot of sexy costumes, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know from her most recent films. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is pretty average or below average, and it looks a lot more like it was made for television than a movie. There is no real horror or tension accumulated and the dialogues are often corny. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the ending because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe there's nothing to be understood about it anyway. But at least you do not get the end you expected, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
