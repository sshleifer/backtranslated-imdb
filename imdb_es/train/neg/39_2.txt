An actress who makes a film in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is held for a ransom. The producer hires someone to go and bring her back. To complicate everything, there are cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a bloody movie of poor quality. There are large amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploitation film designed to attract the darkest parts of our being, and if the film were not so boring, this film would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and the abuse, and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer. The rhythm is off center and puts you out. There are several story lines that seem to happen separately, although ultimately it is quite a story. Worst of all, almost nobody says anything. Most minimal dialogue refers to the cruelty or protests of a character who "will do what I want". It is a film so calm and boring that if it were not for the frequent cries of the victims, I would recommend this as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need to sleep, or unless you need to watch all the Euro-cannibal movies. <br /> <br /> (One aside.) VideoAsia has just released this as part of its Terror Tales series.Its impression is strangely in a box of letters that seems to be the result of taking its impression of a Japanese font (there is fog ) that was cut to remove the subtitles, its printing does not have opening titles either)
