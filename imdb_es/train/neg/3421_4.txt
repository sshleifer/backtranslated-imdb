STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** The Works **** Just miss the mark *** Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Some plutonium has disappeared and some people Very unpleasant now has the means to develop a bomb capable of being completely destroyed, so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his cocky youngster Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the help of the adopted daughter of Josh, Que (Jennifer Tung) set out to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film that dealt with terrorism one year after the events of 9/11. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even commented later on how disturbing the plot of the film looked like in what happened in downtown New York that day, so there would have been those who would have been in the mood for a movie in which Norris and his side. Kick kick some terrorist ass for nothing else. Apart from that, it's as interchangeable as anything else Norris has been in. It makes you wonder what the original did to justify a sequel in the first place, and if he could get a President's Man 3 he could leave soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one, but at least you know what you're getting and, as I said, it could have been just what some needed to vent. **
