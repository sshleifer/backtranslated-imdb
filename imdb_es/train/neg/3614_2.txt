A schizophrenic has escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York City and soon teachers begin to leave St. Trinity University. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the problem of false leads. Despite an execution time of 78 minutes, this cheap slasher is prolonged until the lame ends where the person you suspect is the murderer from the beginning reveals himself as such. Director Richard Haines barely breaks a sweat with a bit of a stalk-n-slash staging scandal, but he has the feeling that the audience of the early '80s was probably looking forward to it. For all of our amateur anthropologists, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 1980s so you can get to know the culture, beliefs and practices of people living in faraway places. The movie has some credit for the "Final Girl." You rarely see that. Also, it's always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Do not you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest and they catch him. However, he is still working on the high moral angle.
