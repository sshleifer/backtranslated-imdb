9, the movie I've been waiting for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of history of 9 and the strange development of the character. All the amazing action sequences in the world do not compensate for a single unfriendly character. <br /> <br /> The strange sequences, almost launched in occultism, were not only out of place, but also exasperating. The story is about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly become an aspirant to the necronomicones of terror with mystical symbols and ghost lines of green magic instead of giving answers to what might have been devices for stories of great fear? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why ... questions that bore you asking only if you care and increasingly less likely to get away from the theater. <br /> <br /> A movie like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth ... I would see this film drawn with crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on the magic of CGI and the name of Tim Burton to attract the crowd. What ... it's what attracted me, but it did not manage to earn my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been amazing ... with some more rewrites and a little more respect from their own creators.
