The title should have been the walker. The boy spends 90% of the movie walking. He does not know what he wants, or what he is. Go through life stealing the identity of the people for nothing. He does not receive any benefit, nor money, nothing that pretends to be another person. <br /> <br /> No body was able to understand why it was pretending to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing What became clear in this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was shit. <br /> <br /> The director may be a loser who would like to be someone else. But what I really should do is get a real job, because after his movie, I do not think he has the opportunity to become a film producer.
