Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a little funny in this 1970s turkey, but the script is so unconvincing and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (right after his Oscar victory) can not begin to take It's from the mud. As a celebrity chasing skirts in his 40s, sellers are embarrassed to the last degree. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. Better performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young type of studio. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers paid them well, because I do not see another reason to calluses like this in 1970 (a very good year for the movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can not win them all!
