All the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (in my opinion, Magneto and Xavier were the best), and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard that this movie was in production, and my expectations grew more and more until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is The Fountain, although you will not hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not. what ruins the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of many meaningless characters who do not add anything to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), who were thrown there to make the fans believe that the filmmakers had Lee the original comics . <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories and this film did not respect any of them. Any. Not even continuity. Does not respect the project Weapon X, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motivations for wolverine are stupid and are seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I expected from the whole damn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 at school when Stryker's men come in and he just decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, this is a family movie and you will not see the explicit violence of the most violent and frightening hero of Marvel. <br /> <br /> Also, I had a constant feeling of dejá vù with this movie because the origins of Wolverine are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton, so it does not make sense to make a film of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally think that Wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid background story. Because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker has his scars?
