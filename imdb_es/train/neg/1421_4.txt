I rented the English-folded version of Lensman, hoping that, since it came from known novels, I would have some substance. While there were hints of substance in the film, it mostly did not rise above the cartoon level for children. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it was lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the novels of origin were light. But for some reason, there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details derived, careless, little dramatized or deficient. Some examples: The initial scenes seemed to be taken from the "stargate" scene of 2001 and the Star Wars image of hyperspace. The robot in the combine looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> Start by trying to borrow your Star Wars comic style, but fortunately (since humor does not work) you give up. In comedy and plays seriously. In that sense, it's superior to the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated due to the annoying stupidity of Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unharvested half of a field, throwing silage into unharvested crops, instead of working from one place to another and unloading the silage in rows already harvested or in a truck. Corn (maize) was spilling the grain hopper, but the farmlands were drawn like a field of wheat. <br /> <br /> When it came time that Kim's father had to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the English language voice actor, but the drawings They did not show much weight either. Kim's reactions in that scene were equally unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name is not revealed until the scene of his death). It seems that she forgets it quickly. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more feelings than her. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; There is at least a touch of feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, the villains do not comply with their orders. A villainous leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. I can not say if it was removed from Star Wars or if it comes from a previous source, possibly from Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which a spaceship crashes. As it sinks to the ground, the parts break off from the ship. But so many pieces fall that there should be nothing left for when the time comes. <br /> <br /> While in most cases, Chris seems a competent and resilient space hero, there is a scene in which he screams like an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone strong enough to overcome Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout: "help, I got caught and I can not reach my gun". Instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality (almost too often) is D.J. Account. It sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American graffiti. I wonder if it is so well expressed in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the movie exploded. The explosions were not impressive, and they seemed to be due to Star Wars. To his credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the main weapon of the Death Star. The dialogue had a good and interesting explanation of the cause. Many other explosions in the movie looked good, but not the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if they were taken from a video game of the late 70s. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some of Tron's influence is also seen . On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, although that emphasizes the corny sound parts. Art is also good, particularly when it stays away from computer graphics, which often look cheesy. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can leave with many production deficiencies. But the plot here was quite light. A naive child tries to help someone in a crippled spaceship and acquires a great power that he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions fight against a powerful and evil enemy. Makes friends, learns about his special power and becomes a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he could even defeat the evil enemy. The details along the way can make that story rise above the simple scheme, but there's very little more than that in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a caricature for children. But then, since it seems that the main audience is older children, maybe it does not need to be more than that.
