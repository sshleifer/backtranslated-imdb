Normally I do not have a problem with the free swearing in movies, but this really bothered me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else pointed out, get cancer) It was boring, rambling and pretentious. I would not do it if it were you. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like movies that, like most people like, say "watch life." I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens is that a load of Taiwanese leads their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film, and I used to work on a construction site. So imagine. Having said that, William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy boredom.
