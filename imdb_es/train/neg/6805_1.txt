I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago ... I still can not believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie of all. If I list all the flaws in the movie, this review would take many sentences (very funny mistakes, for being so bad). <br /> <br /> You have to be amazed with the ability of the commands assigned to rescue the plane. They did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and what I do not understand is how the production wanted me to be like a hero, but it's a zero ... <br /> <br /> Of course, the main faults will be the landing of a 747, and only need 3 or 4 tips of a type in transmission to land the plane ... incredible ... as well as dead bodies that had almost no blood ... <br /> <br /> But I highly recommend watching this movie, as it is very interesting to see how bad something can be.
