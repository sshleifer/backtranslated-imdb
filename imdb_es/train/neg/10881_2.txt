My friend's mom used to work in a video store and had a preview of the movies before they left, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to see her. Since it's supposed to be scary, but it's actually pretty funny, I can say that somehow weird, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've seen in my life, but it's very funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?" I did not know that this movie had premiered ... I thought it was very bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... in general, the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit a lot in at least ) but I promise you that you will get a good laugh. <br /> <br /> * This movie is a bit horrible, but it's good for a laugh ... especially that guy who has the 'dagger of despair' .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!
