Are the Dukes of Hazzard a great achievement? a $ 53 million movie that is worse than any given episode of a low-cost 25-year TV show. The plot is useful enough, but fun is rarely found without meaning and the casting is quite atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Sheriff Roscoe de Gainey is an insensitive bully, Enos, tired of Michael Weston, a seemingly ideal Willie Nelson seems to be waiting for the check and Burt Reynolds, trapped in a purgatory where he is doomed to relive his old movies as a small player, is a Curious choice for Boss Hogg, to say the least, but has a good time with an intruder and a hundred dollar bill. Do you know that a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences? But worse than the script or the cast is the desperate direction of Jay Chandrasekhar: apparently born without a conception of comic time, unable to do much more than the two basic shots and apparently has no idea how to shoot a car chase and much less to the decent tricks in the film, seems determined to undermine the movie of any sign of life before they materialize. There are a couple of good postmodern moments that revolve around the stereotyped role of the Confederate Flag and Daisy in every episode, but no movie that makes you think of the days when Hal Needham was directing this kind of thing (and bad) can be a good idea thing.
