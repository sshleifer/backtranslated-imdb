This horror movie is really weak ... that's if this is the right movie I'm commenting on. Nothing really terrible happens when a family adopts a cute little German Shepard puppy. I had a German shepherd and it's a really good dog. However, I did not have the idea of ​​getting one of this movie, but of the comedy "K-9". That's another story, all together. This movie really does not have much horror, since the most horrible scene is at the end and it looks very corny. Also, we see that a guy almost puts his hand on a lawnmower. That is all. However, the father suspects something, since his family seems to be becoming quite strange, somewhere where he discovers that if you hold them a mirror while they sleep, you can see if they are possessed. In general, a really weak horror movie, even by television standards ... The television films that do work are available, since "This House Possessed" is quite good and there is another movie in a haunted house about a woman and these strange creatures that is also pretty good. This is really pretty boring.
