This movie was horrible. I saw it three times, and not even everything. It is simply impossible to see, the story line sucks, it is depressing and completely disgusting. I do not write spoilers at all, so if you want to know why it's so unpleasant, look at it. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts of the movie. The little boy in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is nonsense. I saw this movie in movie stores across the United States, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The acting is horrible, and the nudity in itself is lame and unpleasant. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the other main character, has not been in such bad films in the past, in fact, was in some pretty good. The same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
