Yes, there are worse movies out there. Most of them are made for fun, with a shoelace budget or as a television game. Movie of the week, but even if this was the "movie of the week" it would not have more than two stars. It is a bad movie about a serious issue that presents a battered woman who flees from the king of the mud people to the protective arms of the king of the most vicious people. (If it's an attempt to prove that you do not need a man to protect her, then wuss man is superfluous from the movie and should not be in it). It has no suspense, character development and a heroine that could be overcome by a rotton onion. (I think she throws her wedding ring into a boat with an independent tank instead of just dropping it overboard into the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after the husband finds her, proving that she she's an imbecile, she still does infant assumptions that almost kill her.) I'm always surprised when I see the kind of generally high rating that a film like this gets and I realize that Dr. Seuss still has a big market without explode of people you would face. For his job. After I finish laughing at humanity, I cry.
