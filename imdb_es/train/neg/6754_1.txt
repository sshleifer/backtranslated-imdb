The only reason why I bother to comment on this movie is to save you the 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it for rent for Â£ 3.00, I found it interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> Within a few minutes of turning it on, I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast should be kept until winter and then thrown into the nearest firewood, where they could meet more of their kind. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), he should be shot, unfortunately this should have been done before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in stores, run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
