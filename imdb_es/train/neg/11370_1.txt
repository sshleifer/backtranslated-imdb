This video contains a clever way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a shame that the people who did it really believe that Americans are so foolish to believe in it, maybe, as a US citizen, every person should protest against this type of garbage. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... THE QURAN IS PUBLIC! You can read it for yourself and decide if what you say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not even related. The music used in some spots prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what is happening there. They use images that are out of place from their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment, I would like to reflect ... Do not you think you can do the same movie with all the religions in the world?
