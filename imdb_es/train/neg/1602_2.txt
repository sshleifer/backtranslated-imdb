Anyone who thinks that this film has not been appreciated by his comic genius must have been smoking with the two drug addicts in the movie. This movie is NOT underestimated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, since the last two films are well written and funny. The class meeting is not one of those things. The sad thing is that it had such potential (good cast, good story lines) but good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny came out more annoying than fun. The stoner types, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
