I saw this in an artistic cinema that also showed "The Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of the other functions, I decided to give Immortel a chance. I almost came out of this movie, AND I LIKE science fiction! The story unfolds in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner-style sky announcements and some similar cloning / synthetic human debates. Unfortunately, the script did not condense enough for a one-hour, forty-five minute film. There are three groups in this world: humans, artificial humans and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans seem to have the advantage and control the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth "cap" on the pyramid - would not a futuristic floating pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests on the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with the so-called plot, but there is a lot of unnecessary gore and many rough scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, thank-you credits were listed for the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The film is French, but it uses British actors who do not speak French. Therefore, it is obvious that his French dialogue has been doubled. This is a distraction, and I also thought that alternating between real humans and animations was quite distracting. It does not help that the animations are bad, nothing better than a video game. Skip this.
