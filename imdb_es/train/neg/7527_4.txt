There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a parody. Sometimes, I felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow instead of a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has everything to do with "Game of Death". In any case, it is more a sequel / remake of 'Enter the Dragon', which incorporates many elements of that film, particularly the actual footage. The character of Bruce Lee, Billy Lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and finds a movie that was left with the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it is up to his wayward brother to avenge the deaths of both men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long stars as Bobby Lo and does not really have the kind of charisma to take the film. Their fighting skills are very good however. Bruce Lee obviously appears thanks to (no longer) the deleted images simply to collect the legacy. Saying that, in general, the images are edited better than in "Game of Death", but they do not prevent the movie from being a disaster. <br /> <br /> Well, then the fights are actually very entertaining (I dare say amazing) and I make the movie at least visible. But there are so many dumb elements in this movie that really tests your patience. In the first place, there is the supposed villain who lives in his palatial estate ... or is that mental institution? Seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, drinks venison blood, wears a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent only makes you feel sorry for him, you almost expect someone to escort him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this center section is horrible and when the scene involves a naked whore and a lion costume arrived, I turned it off. However, I finished the film and I was glad I did because the fight scene towards the end (like 'GOD') was the main reason to see it. While the story is a shame, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the ending disappoints if the premise was something to go to. What they told us was that the 'Tower of Death' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. This sounded great, like a twist on Bruce Lee's original idea with different fighting styles on each level. Could this be the 'Game of Death' that was originally planned? Do not! The movie should have been named "Generator's Death Room" because that's what goes on in the tower. Of itself, in fact there were one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts lined with aluminum foil, leopard-skinned man and stupid monk. It's as if Enter the Dragon had never been made, with the plot being a bad imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the fast-paced fighting scenes, but sometimes they're so stupid that it hurts. If this was thought, then fine. Thumb up, however, to recreate the scene in the projector room from 'Enter The Dragon'.
