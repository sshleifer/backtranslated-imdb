Next warning spoilers. Magnificent recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Apart from that, defamatory, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; Presumably by a largely Canadian team and cast. I received the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada. There is not much more to be said apart from how horrified I was at how shameful American historical propaganda is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the director born in Canada, Roger Spottiswoode, was forced to make the USAF the heroes of the film, when in reality the real rescuers were a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
