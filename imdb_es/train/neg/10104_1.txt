I only saw the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director in history, but that is not true; The idiot who directed this garbage is the director of WORST. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "Police station" hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight in which the blows are clearly lost around the PIECES TEN. <br /> <br /> This policeman detains the women, the wife and takes them to a warehouse. He tells his fellow policeman to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse with a canvas bag. The police colleague thinks that maybe something is not right, that his partner could be a bad cop who is killing these women, but he is not sure that that is what is happening because ... he is an imbecile! The dialogue is totally stupid, the acting is horrible and the characters act in the most stupid way I have seen on the screen. It is totally obvious to the policeman's partner that he is illegally kidnapping these women, who slaps them, takes them to a warehouse and returns to the car with a travel bag with a body inside and, nevertheless, the companion who is there. all the time, he does not know what is happening! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It has to be one of the worst movies I've started to see and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely NO VALUE.
