What a horrible movie. I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this remodeling. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this movie. Mehki Pfifer is great at E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel very bad for them. The musical background that I have to say did not fit ALLLLL's story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced film. I hope that in the future no director so horrible as this has been able to destroy such a great classic movie. This movie should not have been made in the first place. A tip for all those who have seen it, please tell me that I am right because I could not possibly be the only spectator who did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10
