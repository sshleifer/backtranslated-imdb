In this film, supporters of Chávez (Venezuelans and non-Venezuelans) lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say the conflict started because Chávez's announcement fired many of PDVSA's best workers just for political reasons. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about more than 96 televisions Interruptions broadcast by Chávez for only 3 days in "NATIONAL CHAIN" (a kind of confiscation or private TV signals). Each one with approximately 20 minutes duration. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the removal announcement made by the general in chief Lucas Rincon Romero, general inspector of the army forces, who is a traditional Chávez supporter. . Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Minister of Interior and Justice. After Chavez returned, he held the position of Minister of Defense (equal to the Secretary of Defense in the United States). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chavez's orders about firing at a rally of peaceful people demanding elections. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the people in this rally who were killed by Chávez supporters (civilians and military forces). <br /> <br /> They present some facts in an incorrect order, to lie. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the Venezuelan civil society that even now is demanding elections to solve the crisis and the actions of Chávez to avoid the elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you ... This movie is just a lie or a big lie.
