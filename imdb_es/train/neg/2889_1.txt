The case is the best part of the movie but it just is not worth the purchase price. I was expecting a movie "Based on real history", only to find a picture in the home video of badly recorded films, together with pathetic scenes of acting and unrelated killings. The video scenes had numerous rewind situations that were probably used to extend the length of the function instead of the effects. I started this review before the half of the movie was over and I waited for it to end, just in case it had a better ending, but low and here it just got worse. If I could mark it lower, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save money and time with this.
