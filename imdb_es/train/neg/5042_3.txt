The main complaint with this movie is the fact that I CAN NOT say who is who. I did not mean racism, but these Asians look the same! I can tell some of the story, but that's it. The identities of the peoples are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would care. Instead, I did not see them off the screen ASAP. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide shots and silent faces without emotion occupy this film. Hell, it's boring, not only do I not know these people, they're just sitting there. <br /> <br /> The production is typical of John Woo, a terrible video with blurred scenes. This looks just a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). You might think that with a decent budget, at least they could make it look like Hollywood's 90's. I did not know that the Chinese had these art beatniks.
