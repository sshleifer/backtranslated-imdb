I saw him at the noisy UCSB festival and I was surprised he won the Golden Reel. I was not the only one, considering that the audience had mixed the reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better films out there, but then I knew that the judges were deeply rooted in the area of ​​film theory and other artistic things. While cinematography and editing are on par with many other short films, the narrative is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems that the "serious" student films must include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide: Nick and Kate take charge of the police and include all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and it could be the opinion of my stranger, but the boy from Montecito sounds a bit fake. Does anyone else do it that way?
