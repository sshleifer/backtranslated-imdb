I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but possibly worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like the animation, very caricatures of Saturday morning, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, specifically Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was truly a villain in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What he said was nothing special and his animation was ugly. Also his fellow artist, Lars, was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have stopped smoking during the night. The announcers were very good, but especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined it for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bulky, and very suggestive of an extended television episode. In short, a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of Disney films of the 60s along with Jungle Book. I'm sorry, I can only give this a 3/10, it just was not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
