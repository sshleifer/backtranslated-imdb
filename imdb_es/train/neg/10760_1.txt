This "movie" is the culmination of all that is bad about modern cinema. Unnecessary slow motion, flip / jump / unnecessary flips, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogues ... basically, unnecessary. (Is that a word? Well, it was simply invented by I, Robot). <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (ie, the garage of the car, the spray for the skin) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic functions is to slide the card in the cafeteria. <br /> <br /> What happened to show respect towards women? (That is, the character of smith only degrades the doctor for most of the film and yet she still "wants it." WHERE'S THE STRESS? I'll tell you where, good looks and no admiration or points in common) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective who detects? Smith did nothing but sit and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that triggered a thought, he left. this is such an unconvincing way of getting the story from point b-c-d-etc ... it was fine once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was "I'm snoring you and I'm not listening to a joke? Twice in a scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of a movie that they are something significant And not just a tool to promote rescue scenes Shia LaBeouf (the boy) is in the film for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women and B-knows Smith ... ..... Of course, we must worry about him and whether or not he is harmed, <br /> <br /> What happened to Hero's? Let's forget that there are people, women and children all over the world who are attacked by robots and egoistically save the only person that, in my opinion, I know, and why he had to raise his bicycle in the air to show himself, while the doctor could reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot. <br /> > <br /> Do not get me wrong, I am in favor of the show, but I am also for a piece of realism and sign I have to say that I never laughed so hard in a movie in a long time. so thanks Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the change of the social pendulum to simpler techniques, simpler stories and everything else in the movies ... but mainly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Movies: "You have to die"
