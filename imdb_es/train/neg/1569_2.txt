Weak plot, unlikely malfunction of the car, and defenseless helpless characters. At first I thought that this movie was made during the seventies, since the quality of the image, as well as the history and the drama seemed to be taken from an old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found out that it was really done as late as -97, I was surprised. This is by far one of the worst and least suspense films I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, keep in mind that if you see it, you lose time when you could have done something more exciting. , like looking at the dry painting.
