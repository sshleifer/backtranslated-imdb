I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend, who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The film was completely recorded on video, so it looks like a PBS special. The special effects are fake, but in reality there are some moments of fear in the movie that made us jump to our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the scenes of the "plot" are long and very boring, and I will tell you that I have no idea what happened in the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, be sure to pay less than $ 5.
