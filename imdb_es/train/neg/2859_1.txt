It was made in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie that was made in 1998. In one part of the film there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but this makes the extremely amateur work in the CG be even. worst. <br /> <br /> The writing, the acting, the direction and everything else in this movie is just terrible. This is as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Again, as with the other films, the only terrifying part of this movie is that it was actually made and now airs on the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still can not figure out how to somehow make people who have some acting skills act in these movies and then somehow make them act as badly as everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not sure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in your review ... or is one of the people who worked on this movie.
