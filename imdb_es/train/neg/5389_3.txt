If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. The omega man comes to mind. For study credit, they avoided the big-budget, unnecessary, and big-budget technology that typifies movies of this kind. In addition, the configuration and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to escape an overwhelming fatal infectious disease. What is bad is EVERYTHING else! I get tired of infinitely stupid, careless, weak, ineffective and arrogant characters in a movie. That pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it and I found myself shouting to the television repeatedly: "No, do not do that!", "Why are you so stupid?", "Beware!", Etc. A true lack of character development is evident halfway. A film MUST give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you really care what happens to them. This does not. Also, there should have been a longer and more immersive ending to the movie as well.
