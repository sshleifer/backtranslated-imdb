This was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he could not pronounce his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of the name of John Grisham. No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I did not even see everything. I decided that I did not care who did it, then I realized that there was no "detective" who cared!
