The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It looks little like the original story of ETA Hoffman on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story essentially ends in the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to see a series of dances with characters. <br /> <br /> There is an infinite variety of theatrical productions that reinterpret the story in many ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak ballet script. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version really does not make any sense of the drama or the story (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and mystery in the wonderful first act music of Tchaikovsky). The result is a Christmas party in the first half completely forgettable, where almost nothing happens and where even the dance (what little there is of it) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Excessive pantomime, particularly from Drosselmeier, which might seem passable on stage, seems ridiculous for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II on stage version). Although there are some outstanding choreographic aspects, most of the choreography is insipid and boring. This is certainly not a classic Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely considered a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt that he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. Seeing this film version of his theatrical production of El Cascanueces has only reaffirmed this opinion.
