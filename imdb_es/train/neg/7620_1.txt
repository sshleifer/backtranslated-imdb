I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting, but for me Horror, this was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read Gumby-8's comment and he has to be part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old boy or some insane cult member, no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments of Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Quote: "From the opening animation inspired by" Dune "to the fast pace ... this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeated viewing is not unexpected". <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact that the film keeps the eye in motion, is because you keep looking for any kind of suspense. I mean give me a break. Halloween was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and, by the way, it also became a cult classic. As for "repeat the display is not unexpected", I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another appointment of Gumby-8 the only Fan: "The performance is also an important aspect of the film". <Br /> <br /> With all due respect to the actors, his performance is nothing more than Robert Napton's respective talent. <br /> <br /> The catchy slogan: "Beware of the time between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> This is because there is no darkness or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating of the MPAA "Rating R for violence / gore" <br /> <br /> The only gore you see It's a little red paint on a sheet on a dead body you never see. For all I know, it could be a bunch of grass. <br /> <br /> In short, I've seen horror films from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I've seen what I thought was absolutely worse and some that were very good. The director of this movie also did not make any attempt, was asleep or was hit by acid. In any case, I think the actors deserve applause for trying to save a very poor management job. I would give this movie a .5 rating for a 'B' movie.
