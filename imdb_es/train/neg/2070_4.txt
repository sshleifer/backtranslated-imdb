After too many bad memories, I took the opportunity to skip this episode every time I appeared in the Season 2 sequence. Recently I saw it again just to remind me why. I have always considered that this is the worst episode of ST: TNG (with the exception of "Shades of Gray", which hardly counts as an episode). <br /> <br /> I keep hearing the clumsy dialogue and thinking of the script written in pencil by the author's Writing 101 teacher: "SHOW, DO NOT SAY!" From Deanna Troi's pronouncement and constant elbow reminders about what a naughty and charming rogue is, Okona, to Guinan's explanation of how funny her droid joke is, to the resolution of the conflict, who cares? It is not a plot point that is not highlighted and underlined three times for our building, and there is no credible moment in any of that. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too doggy to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that anyone other than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") can get hold of this role marker. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, for the secondary data plot.) While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being fun decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here. Jerry Lewis was funny in a stupid way.) <br /> <br /> On a good day, you can think of this as a charming little tribute to a minor episode of the Original Series. Me, I prefer to jump to "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
