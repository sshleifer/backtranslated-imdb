The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a kind of allegory for a fairy tale with real meaning, and then immediately start talking about animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the problem of the whole movie. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next is a violent psychopath with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once cared for. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is Undefined. You do not connect with the characters, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fans. It seems that the writer was more interested in concentrating all the drama and complexity he could in this film than in exploring the motivations and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> In the last fifteen years new useless story lines have been introduced. Minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to rationalize his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help wondering if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been more suitable for a television series or a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie, I could just. I could not stand the pure lack of quality any longer and I started to laugh at the characters, the relationships and the whole plot. I touched my partner and he also began to crack, like a young man sitting behind us. We strive to control ourselves, but we just could not take advantage of the terrible quality of this film. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the animation is amazing and the viewers will find themselves admiring the exuberant backgrounds and the charming character. designs Animation almost guides you; When you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
