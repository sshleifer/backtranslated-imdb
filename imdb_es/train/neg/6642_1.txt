this movie starts with an ordinary funeral ... and insists so much on this ordinary funeral feeling that I lost interest after 5 minutes of seeing it and started skipping scenes. It seems to me that whoever made this film is afflicted to the point of being trapped in a permanent morbid trance, unable to contemplate anything other than death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark guys in Southpark, I want a movie that in 10 minutes will guide me in an interesting story, I will not sit down and I'll see 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral ... my grandmother in her last years I was fascinated by funerals, maybe she could have enjoyed this "movie".
