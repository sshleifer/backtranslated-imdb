This is one of those issues that I can relate to a bit more than most people, since I hate noise and have no idea how people in big cities, New York, especially how people sleep in absolute! I'm surprised that people can handle all the noise these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes it an interesting subject. It's a pity that that's all. Tim Robbbins is decent, though, except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking for Margarita Leiveva), it did not seem quite there. My greatest hope for this film is that the casting agents see the absolutely incredible and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is a beautiful supermodel. Even when they are trying to make her look at another girl next door. It saddens me that there may be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without skills or exchangeable talents, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not like this movie very much because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw a new talent. I hope that the producers and directors think about Margarita when they need a new and beautiful actress to participate in a big budget movie. If they can turn Megan Fox into a star (for example, she is not as good and her "talent" as an actor is worse than the one made for Disney TV shows) of 1 movie, it should be easy for her, as is . beautiful and has talent! I would recommend changing your last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more commercial. I hope this makes her career, and if there is some justice, she can appear in a great summer movie or two in the next two years.
