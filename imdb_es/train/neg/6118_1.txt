This is not a very good account of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the amateur! Bo Derek in '10' was at least a comic movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is just soft porn. If you like that, then, move quickly and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was once again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show his terrible acting. Undoubtedly, she is a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this one; This was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time in this movie ... go buy the book.
