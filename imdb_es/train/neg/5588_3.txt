This is an attempt, both by the author Edgar Rice Burroughs and the filmmakers, in an Arab "Tarzan of the Apes". But, this movie set in the desert does not show any of the majestic presents in the most successful adventure of Burroughs in the jungle. The focus is on the love between the handsome English nobleman Jon Hall (as "The 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), and revenge matches his need to merge. The opening states that, although he is guilty of improper conduct, the boy's mother lives, but never returns to the scene. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated, and it looks like missing footage. <br /> <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
