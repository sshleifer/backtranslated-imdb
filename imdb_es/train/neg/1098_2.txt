I got this movie in the $ 5 container at Walmart. I would not recommend seeing this movement. I could give it to one of my friends if I am angry with them and I want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover, flipped through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I had known how boring this movie was before I turned it on. It was my mistake to think that something was going to happen in this movie. It is a group of people who go from one training field to another. The drill sergeants treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of the fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well, here is my rant about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and difficult. watch. It was just one of those movies that you put and you get stuck watching because you want to turn it off, but you have to wait until it reaches the end. He does not do it After I finished the movie, I got over it behind my TV, because I was angry at having lost almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
