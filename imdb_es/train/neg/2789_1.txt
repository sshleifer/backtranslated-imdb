Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video with minimal lighting and a horrible performance. Not only that the plot and the script were miserable. I do not know why this movie was made. I've seen many movies in my time and the ones I really hate are the movies that make me angry. This boiled my blood. The situations were inane at best. If I had made a movie like this, it would have been a short one. Really because those "idjits" of backwoods would not have been in the image. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover in the D.V.D. I am an avid spectator of bad cinema. But this movie is practically impossible to see. I do not care if the films are filmed in D.V. but if you are going to do that, make the film pleasant, not a retreaded tired of superior horror movies (without error). <br /> <br /> I should not recommend this disk loss. If you come across this one, stop by the rental store. <br /> <br /> The movies that make yours really angry get an automatic 1.
