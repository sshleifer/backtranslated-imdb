........ and an extremely bad one in that! How long did this train crash last? 14 episodes or something? Now I can see why. <br /> <br /> I bought the episode "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. That's the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident?) <br /> <br /> I'm not really going to comment on the performance, since these were, I think, fairly new people who really did not get the job down just right right still. At least I've never seen them before in any kind of important show, theater or television. If I did, then I easily forgot them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. It's true that this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did it better than this and that was thirty-five years ago. Especially I laughed at the bad guys (reapers or something like that) of the ship, as it chased the hilarious looking firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines that looked something like a gigantic model rocket. I expected to see Wiley Coyote at the top, while chasing the Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines do not even make it that bad. <br /> <br /> And that was not the worst. The wild-west shootings made me wonder if I was actually watching a sci-fi movie or one of Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste time ... I did ... all 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
