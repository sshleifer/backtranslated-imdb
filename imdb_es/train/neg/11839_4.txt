"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes that feature an intelligent dialogue and some good performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than he expected as Chaplin (in part thanks to an excellent job of makeup and hair of a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as the novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning like Marion Davies (although it's hard to explain why movies never use her stutter in real life). But these elements do not add to a successful whole. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard in certain scenes (the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are especially well made), but not so much in the big picture. Several minor characters do not need to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?), And the party scenes are repetitive and boring. I would like to think that a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized by being a type of standard bubbling flapper, which is not really accurate, and the screenwriter's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed to be connected to the 1930s in "Paper Moon," lacks a similar affinity with the 1920s. He insisted that the excellent costume designer wear only black and cream, which gives party guests a very artificial appearance, and reproduces only the most stereotyped songs of the time (for example, "Yes, we do not have bananas"). ). When Hearst insists that everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It seems as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was filmed. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can make fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
