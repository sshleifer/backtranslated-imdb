I'm pretty sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can not make a 13-year-old laugh because of silly humor, you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose otherwise. The movie is full of predictable jokes (some of them are racist) and very funny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died and that she is pregnant (as I write this, I can not believe that this was really a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors' desk and tries to put it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! DO NOT! The baseline that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should have been at the top". ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
