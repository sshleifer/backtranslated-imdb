Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight compared to dramatic films (just look at Academy Award nominations every year). But still, the good ones are truly an art form. Watch "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle", and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to build something that looks like a romantic comedy. But nobody believes the romance between the main characters, and there's nothing fun to make up for that important deficiency. Modine is much more than a leader, especially a romantic protagonist. I am sure that, as an executive producer, I had the means, but not the good sense, to throw myself out. And Gershon ... I see possibilities of some comic talent, but she had no script and a badly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Useless. <br /> <br /> Others have said it, but I want to repeat: this story is badly conceived, badly executed; the actors are terribly grumpy; and the characters, well, we just do not give them any importance. <br /> <br /> An art form that is not. Go rent "Moonstruck" again.
