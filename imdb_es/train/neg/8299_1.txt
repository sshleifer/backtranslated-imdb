A Christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. So, naturally, I was thrilled when this movie came out in 1994. I saw it on the day of the opening and I prepared to enjoy it. I left revolted and disappointed. The anticipation that sounded true in a Christmas story is curiously missing in this mess. It is better to get a Red Ryder BB gun than a Chinese shirt. And it's not funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but the Buck stops there. Final result: 1 star. Do not even bother.
