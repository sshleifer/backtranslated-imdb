Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. It's a kind of bad showman that can make you feel sick ... very embarrassing. Nacho had done some commercials on television, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney in Madrid (the commercial was about a CD collection by Mc Carney). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like a commercial by Nacho: bad history, bad direction and horrible performances. I can not believe that a filthy movie like this was at the Kodak theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could make this film thanks to his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with the businessmen of Spanish television.
