A new version of the magnificent film of the 1972 play, which presents Caine as the nemesis of his character in the first film. But not doing anything more pleasant at all. <br /> <br /> A low-level performance of the actors, Law and Caine, further diluted by a weak and self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> The warmth of the configuration in the original is abandoned for a super modern home installation. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, which made the first movie look so good, is replaced by a horrendous and reckless arrogance that instantly engenders disdain in the viewer. But this is not the skillful, good and happy to like one, and then the other character that the original fostered so well, this is an obvious OTT murder of both characters of the word go. <br /> <br /> This version It's really not worth seeing Sleuth, watch the original movie and let yourself be dazzled by the opening act.
