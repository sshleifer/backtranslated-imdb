I have to admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A top Hollywood movie. But ... nobody mentioned this until now (at least in the last 20 comments), when it came to the court scenes and the character of Brat Pitt followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are accused of murder. he felt cheated. This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept his false alibi, attested by the priest? If these two boys had been with him, why should not they tell him during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or jury member, would you believe it? Is it prudent to give away the motive of the murderers? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this makes me angry. This movie had great potential. 4/10
