If this movie were about a fictional character, the film could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are shaded in a very unfair way towards Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller events were ignored (Carter was NOT the number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the bigger facts , as apparently the fact that we rob the decision of Joey Giardello by "racist" judges is inexcusable for those of us who have seen the recorded fight, and it is totally disrespectful for Giardello. Why it seems strange to me that Hollywood feels the need to turn a hero into someone who, at best, was in trouble and around the problems much more than any normal person should be (he was arrested several times for hitting women). Ruben Carter never went, seeing his actions in the 60s and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can admire. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct and Washington can act, but the reason they chose this story because their vehicle surpasses me. Is Hollywood so in need of a black hero that they need to force the truth in all their photographs to be credible? (Here is a suggestion, what if Denzel plays a movie about himself? Now that's inspiring.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest this one happen.
