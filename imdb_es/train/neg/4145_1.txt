Well, I've seen this movie twice now, I've researched it a lot on the net, I've asked several people about their opinions. I have even read the original version of Sheridan Lafanu's classic 'Carmilla', a book in which this film is supposed to be based. I feel like the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play while you watch it. As the plot of the film does not seem to make any sense, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine. They continue their lives happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from the "General", a man who has proposed to fulfill his mission in life to avenge the death of his daughters. He states that the supernatural powers are in action and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance meeting with a strange woman causes the Lafontaines to take care of their daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon, Laura begins to feel overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to suffer a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she have to do with Laura's condition and with the General? <br /> <br /> I have invented this game and I would like it to be played by as many people as possible, and let me know what the results are. I even have a catchy name, and I would also have a jingle, but I can not bother with that. It's called the game "this movie does not make any sense". <br /> <br /> All you have to do is, while watching the movie, try to create a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all the questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> You will have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk in the day? light? <br /> <br /> * Why are all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? and why does it shoot itself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why killing zombies seems to be an accepted part of life that Why Travis Fontaine realizes and runs over a zombie without slowing down while driving his car, but when he faces a woman with an obvious hostage in the back? your car, do you accept the excuse that she is also a zombie? <br /> <br /> * And why do you let a girl, who then openly reveals that he knows he's the boss vampire, drive with him in his car? ? <br /> <br /> * And then let her go alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the asylum scene about? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is green goo about? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why is there never a vampire fighting? Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? What is it made of? Why do you kill vampires? And how does Jenna know? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's really fun to try asking so many questions about this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I have my argument, and I have to admit that it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> In the Conclusion <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs. Zombies' does not have any time there where they are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the film seems to know exactly what is happening, however, they seem very reluctant to let the audience know about this. And somehow it is based on a classic nineteenth century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
