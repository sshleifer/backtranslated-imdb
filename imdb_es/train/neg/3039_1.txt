I can always say when something is going to be a success. I see it or I hear it, and I have a good feeling. I did not have a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all excited about this movie, and it does not surprise me at all that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 movies. In fact, it proved that he was right. <br /> <br /> The first thing he threw at me was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black, by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that does not have bad grammar. I listened to the dialogue, I saw the performance and all I could do was put faces. <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of the dance film is being exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not move me.
