This movie was just terrible, the first movie was not so good, I mean it's ridiculously stupid if you did not have enough with the first 5 movies you had to add another one, why not turn this into an ongoing series like James Bond ? , I'll tell you exactly why, because bond movies are actually very good and these movies just suck, I do not understand, this was supposed to be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for God's sake, my son of 1 The niece would not be frightened by such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so-called horror movie. Please, no more of these movies.
