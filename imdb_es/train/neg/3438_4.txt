Haunted Boat is sold only when "The Fog" meets "Open Water". In many ways this is precise. There are fear and strange looking people to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the ability to act is poor at best. Showing clear signs that this is simply a group of friends making a horror movie. What in all credit do the best they can. When you accept the low budget, it is very difficult for special effects, since ghosts look a lot like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. But suffer from using too many twists and turns in a short space of time that leaves you bored and confused. As for keeping you awake, the movie does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant torque every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. And we are willing to wait 1 hour and 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship, but it will definitely do it for one night in front of the TV.
