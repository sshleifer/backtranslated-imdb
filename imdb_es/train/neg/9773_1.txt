When it premiered, I thought it was one of the most profane movies that had been made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other filmmakers like him, there have been higher quality movies, in terms of language, than this ... but this is a pretty brutal assault on the ears. Hey, I can stand it a lot, but this got ridiculous. Only in the first six minutes, I listened to half a dozen uses of the name of the Lord in vain plus an incalculable number of words. I wonder how many people left the theater watching this in 1990. I could not have been the only one. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that some of the main actors include Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. From this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing Godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and General". The role of Lang here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst person of poor quality in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Pressing, somber, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives that people used, including some liberal critics, to describe this story, which is even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics, all extreme liberals, praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most of the critics were upset, and also almost all public payers. It's amazing that someone can praise garbage and garbage in this way. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good and nice characters in this whole movie. This is a bad, sick film: one of the worst in the "modern era". That is, unless you enjoy watching child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, two hours in a row of nothing but atrocities and simply evil people. No thanks.
