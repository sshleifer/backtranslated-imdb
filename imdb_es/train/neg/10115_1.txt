I have made my personal mission to persecute those responsible for this film. I even got the rental company to return my money because I argued that they had perpetrated false advertising. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that the film itself is a p.o.s., but the cover is what sold me. I've done better make-up effects on my kids on Halloween than what the movie really represents compared to the cover. Can you say "raccoon eyes"? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste any more time going into all the details, but, come on, the main character in the movie is a Los Angeles cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent !? ! It is more than insulting.
