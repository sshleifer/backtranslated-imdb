If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt that my money was not wasted completely. <br /> <br /> Then I saw On Stevenly's On Deadly Ground by Steven Segal. <br /> <br /> This movie should see a resurrection though in MST 3K. If Santa Claus conquers, the Martians could explode the head of Tom Servo, one wonders what chaos this film could cause. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a film career. <br /> <br /> The writers of this dreck should be forced to use banners every day of their lives that say "The bitch slaps me! I was a Gymkata writer".
