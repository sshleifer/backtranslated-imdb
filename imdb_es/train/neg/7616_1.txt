The good news is that a movie was made, based on an alleged Aztec myth and presenting an unusually Aztec-American cast (there is such a word). The bad news is that he died at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood left his retirement and trained George Romaro through his classic "Night of the Living Dead", this is what we could have discovered. with. 'The Legend of Diablo' is clearly the forage for any future resurrection of 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' <br /> <br /> I do not think you can even call this a 'B' movie. The production values ​​are so abysmal that I got the feeling that I was watching a long parody of a variety show or an 8mm film in a garden shot by a group of school children. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot line sounded interesting enough to encourage me to rent it. A rural California sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally unties it in the unsuspecting community. His daughters, a hot and another homely, join a gringo FBI and a priest to try to return to close the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene you've seen in previous movies of the undead is poorly portrayed. These zombies walk more like an army of crazy teachers than the undead! Are the supposed infrared scenes from the demon's point of view anything special? and he / she / she / he / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / it / she / he / she / she / he / she / he / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / she / he / she / it seems to go back a lot (instead of turning the movement forward ) And the scene in which the priest deceives the demon out of the cave in rapid motion is ridiculous! Actually, it really seems to have been made for the comic effect, although I know it was not like that! I'm still waiting for the Benny Hill song to start playing and for the whole bunch of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, who calls the FBI The agent becomes downright funny. Then again, that's how most of this cheese ball was! Robert Napton, director and screenwriter of the script, should win SOMETHING for this effort! (How about a blackball for life, like the 'Hollywood 10?'). This, now I see it, has a rating of 1.5 on a scale of 10. I'm afraid this could be a little generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good in this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty sexy like the youngest daughter of the dead sheriff. This is probably the reason why his older, home-loving sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who pitched for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have stuck to baseball. In fact, they could not have done worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it 'Demons in the garden!' <br /> <br /> If I discover that this was actually a project for a community college Film class, I will apologize. It could be good enough for a B or even a B +, as long as the gang brings the college camcorder to the campus in one piece! 'The Blair Witch Project' showed that a great and cheesy film could be made with few resources. 'The Devil legend', however, did not seem to have a very small shoes budget to work with! It was low budget, low talent, low everything. The final scene, and I mean the final 10 seconds of the movie, is the ONLY moment slightly creative or interesting. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have spent it better on a hamburger!
