This movie is not based on the bible. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. And much less talk about it. Do not quote from the scriptures. The final times are called the great tribulation. The movie does not even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven vile and seven trumpets of judgments are reduced to 15 seconds of news of the sea that change its structure. The antichrist was killed 3 and a half years after the tribulation and that's how the movie ended. The only part that was right was that there were two prophets. Of course, they did not use their names because that would be too close to the truth of the Scriptures. The worst part was that he really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take the unsaved to that. I feel that the movie is evil. It's a fake like everything the devil does. I just hope it does not get away from the next movie based on the books that have been left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I've seen better episodes of vice in Miami.
