I agree with everything Calamine has said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it's time for girls to move to better roles. I would like to see them succeed a lot because they were a very inspiring couple in their growth and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their careers, as well as in their personal lives. Then, producers, give girls the opportunity to develop something that goes a little way off the tangent, move them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many facets. This film that is being discussed is not so bad, but as I have seen later in his films, his films are still the same as the typical plot and typography. When In Rome is good for the audiences of younger generations, but the adults who were children when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes, so I think adults would like to watch them make films of different types , maybe some are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolat, that kind of movie: they do not claim to have only serious movies for them, but also humorous, but rather to see them in roles different from those they have been interpreting in their films. recent like East and the minute of New York. (Note: I'm from Australia, so excuse my strange spelling, like recognizing with s instead of with z)
