***** THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS, but that determination would be insignificant in such a classic and well-known story ***** <br /> <br /> The story of CINDERELLA is classified as my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This can not work if history deviates or attempts to launch some interesting ideas along with a magical photograph and dazzling-looking production designs with little guidance and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never breaks. or, rather, it never becomes a swan. <br /> <br /> All the production value that money can buy, can not buy a good cinematographic moment and a spectacular development, or a good performance. <br /> <br /> The entrance of the presence of Cinderella in the dance so badly done, there was no drama of anticipation or emotion of discovery. <br /> <br /> The writing also made me very nervous. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable memory. Why would a girl want to marry a coarse, self-absorbed prince who did not like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's turn in the role of the Stepmother was a shamefully painful demonstration that showed phrases of one line rather than a nuance of acting. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella part had little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence describes this attempt: Very cheap in the 90s, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is glorious photography, matte work and production design. It was a pleasure to review the landscapes, the scenarios and the scenarios as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella stories, choose two gems: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and the Hammerstein Musical Cinderella with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious scenario of the 60s TVs, this is the best celluloid version, without exception. A cast of stars goes out of their way to provide the highest entertainment. Attractive, fun and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Forever: this jewel of Drew Barrymore maintains the historical perspective, alters the storyline but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale. The characters of the directors and all the supporting roles were written with intelligence and acted well.
