Serum is about a mad doctor who finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead, create some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. The angry doc creates some zombies from corpses and has some problems. There is a very long advantage in the whole action with many scenes that allow you to become familiar with the characters. The nephew of the crazy doctor gets into a car accident and the crazy doctor tries to use his new serum on the child. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with good performance but with some direction problems and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this and the effects, although they are adequate, are nothing special. You can move quickly through the slow parts and enjoy some of the action scenes. Beware of nudity and bad language.
