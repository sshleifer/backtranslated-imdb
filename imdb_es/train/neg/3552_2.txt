I have finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 years to see it and well, surely it was not worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is strictly a horror movie: the killer / invisible monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie is like this: the movie starts with the murder; then blah blah blah blah blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; another murder (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The movie is totally predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red herring used in the movie would not convince a 5-year-old boy. And I discovered the secret identity of the incubation at the time I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ending came, I was not surprised or surprised. In fact, it was so much fun that I kept laughing a few days after watching the movie. He is so stupid! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is so similar to the number that the sequence of the "rock band" is one of the few highlights in this sad movie. It is an outstanding scene, not necessarily because it is good, but because it is very funny and useless: the movie that is playing on the big screen shows a moment of rock video with a guy in red leather pants who cut his hair, obviously false, all this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the cinema bathroom by the incubus. The best I can say about this movie is cinematography, which I really liked. But aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it's, unintentionally, hilarious.
