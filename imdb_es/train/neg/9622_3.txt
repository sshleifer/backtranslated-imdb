When I saw that this movie was shown on television, I really wanted to see it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like all those who have grown up in that era, I've seen all the teen movies and summer camps of the 80s. So I could not wait to see this movie that totally falsifies that kind of movie. What a disappointment!! The movie was just a bunch of really bad jokes and pranks again and again, with hardly any argument or substance. And the attempts of the filmmakers for the black humor totally failed: some of these supposed jokes were not considered cruel and offensive at all. The only good things about this movie were costumes, music and acting. It was nice to take a nostalgic trip and see all the styles of summer clothes of the 80s, and the same goes for music. And the performance was excellent: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they did not have better material to work with.
