It seems that the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes subcontracted the writing of this somewhere in the coast, perhaps to MediocreLand. "PP" reminds me of any of the many tedious movies, promising at first but predictable within 1 season of David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they receive are so extravagant that they hardly evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what really makes good medical dramas work: dramatic situations that he's afraid of, "this could be me." They are not fun either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the lines of the plot are dead and can not come back to life. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you that Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical and untrained therapist. Whoever writes their things suspended ethics and transference / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with the wife who bleeds her nose and the therapist's participation in it). No therapist is that bad. <br /> <br /> The women who yearn for men who have gone ahead have been killed, we all have graduated in "Sex and the City". Addison in his youthful aggression towards the boy he likes, very inappropriate for his age, does not seem so natural for a woman over 40 years old, and this talented actress does not believe it and does not deliver it very well . The only successful / tasty developments are Addison struggling with his decision to move to Los Angeles, and the "Voodoo Dr" and his management of widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept could work with a new team of writers.
