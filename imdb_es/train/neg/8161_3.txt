Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery death in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the trap of the 80's the weird / Stupid special effects, including a strange rocking horse with an insane appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the spirit of Mary Lou does bad things to people and tries to take over a person's body. Whether you succeed or not, you'll have to see it to find out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty boring and it's based on a lot of worthless characters. This is not really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the average. the horror movie falls, gore, meaningless nudity, hits the Catholic church. Basic things, boring movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is decent enough to give you 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
