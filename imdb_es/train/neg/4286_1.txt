This is practically the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say enough, because I've also seen Soldier, in which he plays the villain ... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. This, however, is. And if this is an indication of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist ... as a leader, it's horrible. He gets into a fight with random nameless characters every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter could not figure out how to extend the movie to the minimum execution time required for a movie. The villain is the only character, even with a touch of personality, and apart from the fact that he is a demonstrable madman, he hardly looks like a villain. Most of the movie is basically Lee chasing the villain through time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I definitely would not see it again to make sure. The effects are not all horrible ... but they are close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow, the movie also ruins that interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for its own sake. The rhythm is poor. I can not think of anything positive to say about this movie ... I really can not. It is simply too formulated and meaningless. If only I had a time machine, so I could go back and prevent this movie from being made ... no, it does not matter. I just hope that as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to negative critics. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee's fans, and to no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, this is not it. That is sure. 1/10
