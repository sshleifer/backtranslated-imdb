I will be forceful and to the point. This movie is not good at all. The part of my movie buff hated acting, the script, the story, the direction and almost the entire edition. Amanda Peet has shown that she can act, since it was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot stick. However, the childhood part of me found this movie very funny. If you can forget about the inferior quality of production, and if you find funny jokes, then you should be fine. And for those of you who can not get off your pedestal, that is your choice. My inner child has not died, and I laughed a little. Even then, only 3 out of ten, because like a movie, it really sucks.
