Of the many problems with this movie, the worst is the continuity; and reissued on VHS for a university cable channel many years ago, I tried to find out exactly what went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer film and then cut it for a standard theatrical display. How much longer? To complete all the gaps in the plot, as we have it, it will take approximately three hours more of narrative and character development, especially since the movie we have is very slow and is taken very seriously. <br /> <br /> That's amazing; What could the Halperines have tried here? His previous film, "White Zombie," was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate Universal Studios' first monster movies (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and, as such, adhered quite a bit to zombie mythology. America would know about popular magazines. <br /> <br /> Revolt of the Zombies, on the other hand, seems to have been an allegory of the politics of modern warfare. This would not only explain the opening and change of Dean Jagger's character to a megalomaniac, but also explain why zombies do not really do much in the movie, besides standing up, being frightened and waiting for orders, they're just soldiers allegorical, not the undead cannibals that we have all come to love and hate in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to anyone in my distaste for modern war and its politics, but I believe that the film should be entertaining first, and only later, perhaps, educational. And definitely, a movie about zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the strangest movies in Hollywood history, but I can not recommend it, even for its historical value.
