It seems that there is a bit of a curse when it comes to gay cinema. That is, happy endings are not very common. Beautiful thing excluded, gay movies tend to end in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, just end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible piece of nonsense have one or two things to learn about the plot, the direction and the timelines. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a bit confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of the character of Jeremie Elkaim with a small session of psychology. It seems that this film was reconstructed at random without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to know when you are seeing the present or some kind of ethereal flashback. I could only take it long before it became really unattractive. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film "... brilliantly beautiful and completely real". Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer glasses before seeing them, since this is far from beautiful. Because of all the accolades that this film received, I expected something worth watching. Unfortunately, the movie lived up to its title. And at the end of the movie (which did not provide any resolution, I can add), it is clear that the writers, the director and the film have everything Come Undone.
