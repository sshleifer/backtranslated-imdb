The plot is so manipulative that it fully counts on the most incredible and unthinkable decisions of adults in each of the parenting decisions. The children are super in terms of the charm and the delivery of the lines, but as I say, the whole plot depends on each and every one of the adults being complete idiots, and therefore, in that case, give more meaning to their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the actions of the boys of total distrust). Why did lovely little children carry a baby from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and, at the same time, realize that it is the LAST place to be registered? Why the 2 children are NEVER informed and, on the other hand, at the same time that a baby is missing, nobody says anything about them running with food and diapers with all that commotion and, literally, in any other place where they searched? There is simply no possible justification for asking the audience to believe this. Asking him to believe that it would be good for the trial (even the informal environment) is too insulting to be discovered.
