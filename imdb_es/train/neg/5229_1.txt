Boring things we have here. Your 5 minute shorts are better than this. know why? Because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit ... uh ... the last half hour is fine, the rest is boring and it's not funny = (I had high hopes, the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this The movie is quite slow and, unfortunately, it's not funny, just boring klaymen running between us and trying to make us laugh ... it does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next time Knox. <br / > <br /> Maybe trimming this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now it's not good.
