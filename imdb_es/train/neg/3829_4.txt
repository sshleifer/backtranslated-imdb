A prison thief incarcerated near Yuma frees himself from his gang and goes to the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden cache of gold that remains hidden thanks to the scriptwriter). The attempt to update the Western genre with violence and brutality in the style of the 1970s is not even in the same category as some of the new Westerns that emerged in the late 1960s. It is incredibly simple and square, with the female characters simply as sandbags and possible victims of rape. As the former bailiff back in command, Charlton Heston offers one of his most lazy and least inspired performances (he has a good time, trying to read a letter and looking for glasses). James Coburn, like the half-mad mongrel, is also an autopilot pilot, but Coburn has a way of turning even the most boring dialogue and situations into something thorny and disconcerting. It's your show all the way. * 1/2 of ****
