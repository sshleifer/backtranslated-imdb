One of the worst movies I've seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a nonsensical clich√© of an exercise in slasher movies. Try to twist or twist the genre with absurd plot lines of a crazy and psychotic fanatic: the film snakes into nothingness. (spoiler) Should we believe that an idiot with a knife has access to and murders a baseball player in a luxurious hotel without witnesses, security or cameras? The movie makes no sense trying to pull the strings of our heart through the baseball brouhaha, ending mockingly unsophisticated and gruesome. I'm not sure what all the actors thought when they got on board this razzie. This is a great failure as they come. Stay away if you prefer to think about your movies.
