"Problem Child" is one of the dumbest movies ever made. It's not the worst (although some people will not agree with me on that), but it's not the best either. It is a diabolic child of 7 years that destroys the comic in a couple without children (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who adopts foolishly. This movie is too stupid and incredible because I do not buy for a second that a child can act as rude as the child in this movie. It is absurd and absurd, although I laughed several times (I do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm being very kind to that. If there is something positive in "Problem Child" it is that it is better than the sequel, which was horrible. <br /> <br /> ** (of four)
