This movie was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First, the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF continues with this van love. The plot, basically, is: the boy wants to have sex, so he buys a van (which, to be fair, is pretty cool) Incredibly, since he looks like a triton, he scores with many girls! And he fails with some. Then he marks with a really sexy girl and realizes that he loves this scruffy bird that played hard to get it. Then drag racing with the boyfriend of the hot girls. And he leans his truck. At that point danny devito saves the day. Although I did not need it because when I tilted the van, the ginger boy crossed the line first. I gave him these 2 * as I am willing to assume that there is some kind of subculture Vanning of the 70 that I am not receiving and also because there is also a boobage of the 70s.
