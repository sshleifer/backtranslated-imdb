This movie has a lot of great adult stars, but it does not get you interested in the way an adult movie should. Among all the stars you could not get your kicks from any of the scenes. The movie is shot in a middle-aged dream game that is ridiculously cheesy. The acting is worse than that of Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about his son in college, and the dialogue is the worst I've seen in a movie. The plot was also worse for ten times. I would stick to the amateur route. The audio comment was useless since it is a skin movie, but even then that was also bad. Unless you're a Jenna Jameson fan, there's little here. 4/10
