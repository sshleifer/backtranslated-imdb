I must tell you from the beginning, I'm certainly not an authority in the Bollywood movies and I've only seen a handful. However, if you have never seen one, DO NOT start with this one! I've really enjoyed the ones I've seen until this one, but I could not stand this. I must also tell you from the beginning that I could not finish this movie, it was so annoying. So, why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the movie. He is even more upset than Jar-Jar Binks, which he would never have believed would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was meant to be a comic relief. Instead, he just irritated my nerves and wanted me to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his displeasure, he just did not seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in, and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had the incredible ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. No kidding, there was a scene in which several unarmed men faced a small army of men with these assault rifles! And, again and again, they avoided receiving a single bullet And they beat the ruffians! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" look mundane! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so fucking noisy, in your face and intense, it practically made my brain bleed! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of methamphetamine! Crazy camera angles, music and INTENSE action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not take a movie with the plot and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations have no meaning ... none at all! <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you're the hottest and most fanatical Bollywood act, you can stand this movie, but for my part, I can see why it's on the infamous IMDb Bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad!
