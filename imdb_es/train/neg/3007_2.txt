Well, in the endless search for horror, we will find this movie, apparently reedited on DVD recently for some impious reason. The transfer is horrible and the quality just sucks. I do not think this is due to a bad remaster or something like that, I just think the movie is wrong. <br /> <br /> Obviously filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer and no talent tricks, "Slaughter High" starts slow and does not accelerate until about an hour. First, we can see a nerd when he's picked up by a group of ... I really do not. Did not even know what they were supposed to be ... athletes? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly that he should definitely have been chosen as the nerd. Then, there is a "big boy" and a couple of losers and foolish chicks who are supposed to be "good" but are not. It's a mystery why this group of rejections is messing with one of their own, but I guess the viewer must assume that these are "great kids" who choose a dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous since most high school students are played by thirty-somethings. As other critics have pointed out here, the actors (if you can call them that) are a group of Britons whose accents slide several times along this garbage. We have to assume that this group of "children" were the only students in this school, since their "meeting" is only for them in the school, which now is shown as abandoned, it is only for them. <br /> <br /> The murders are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: 'This place gives me chills ...' and 'Someone give me a beer' are highlights ... It's just not good. Skip this unless you're wasted with some friends and want to laugh at a real slasher attempt. If you want to see well, make Bava's "Bay of Blood" 14 years ago and much better. If you want to see a good BAD Slasher, see "Just before sunrise" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10 children.
