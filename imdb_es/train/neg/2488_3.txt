What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a policeman who extracts bullets from himself after being shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the flask that has been fired about fifty times so far) and a secret tank kept by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason take it to Mexico. It was never clarified if they were sent there intentionally or simply were really lost. And you will never hear another script with the word "Butthorn" either. Gary Busey proves the role of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a useful actor, the script condemns the whole film to mediocrity. William Smith makes another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years before. After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s, it was nice to see him expand his range of the communist weights. Sadly, he'll probably always be better remembered as the boy Clint Eastwood mumbled in "Any way you can."
