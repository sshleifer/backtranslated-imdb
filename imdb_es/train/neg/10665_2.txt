Approximately three minutes into this I started to move fast, stopping only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I finished, and wishing I could recover my money from the rental store. The people who write these films must be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on, writers, the bad guys always get in the car with the pump activated by the good's remote control! This has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to add insults to the injuries, the "turn" at the end was so formal, that it could come from any action film written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time. Flees! Run away!
