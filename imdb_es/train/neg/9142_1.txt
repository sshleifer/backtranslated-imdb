I just saw this after hearing how bad it was and wanted to see it for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will not be able to understand how horrible this movie is, although it has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen! I never bothered to post a comment here before, but this shit really justifies it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole plot is ridiculous and pointless. Brother of the main character (either Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly it is never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage killing everyone in sight, because homosexuality is abominable for Christians, but apparently murder en masse is not 't Then another shit is thrown on one of the ex-wife of the gay couple who tries to force him to marry her again at gunpoint. This does not lead to anything, but it gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "movie": "I have no sense, it does not make sense! That's what makes sense!" Sparkly. <br /> <br /> Then there is the performance, which is simply atrocious. To see is to believe. My personal favorite is the civil rights lawyer, apparently drugged, who is clearly reading her lines from something, and still manages to ruin them. Enough talk. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There's the vaguely attractive guy and completely without gummies, and her boyfriend, who looks like that little cartoon man from the bisto ads. Only fatter. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" has also been shot by someone who is unable to hold a camera even remotely, and the number of errors is surprising. It all starts with the main fat man in bed with a pair of boots on. Yes. <br /> <br /> But anyway, we all know how terrible this is, so I'd like to highlight some of the most valuable comedy moments the "movie" offers. <br /> <br /> - When the fat man sets fire to the church and then throws himself like a six-year-old girl through the parking lot to escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I have no idea how it relates to the main characters: sometimes they know her, sometimes not, but she appears in a couple of scenes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The drugged lawyer. I already mentioned it, but it's so funny that it deserves another mention. <br /> <br /> - The dinner of the evil brothers of cookies that he puts for his guests. <br /> <br /> - The anti of the evil brother. gay potion <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end, I will not give in because YOU MUST see yourself to believe it. I warn you to make sure you're not eating at that moment. The main butter tub protagonist / director / producer gets naked. It's disgusting <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally, the funniest thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a movie, the thug of a director even manages to turn the initial credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
