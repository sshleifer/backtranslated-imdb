Without any failure for the actors (all of them performed great performances), the general story was not very well executed. The film begins with a great zinger: a crazy old man forces a young man from an aboriginal girl to leave the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a completely new group of characters ... and we do not know why until the 40 minutes end. It turns out that they are the ones who finally discover the body of the girl ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> Although the story picks up at that point, it really does not go anywhere. After 2 hours, I asked myself: was there a point in this, or just to see the characters fight with the accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. While it is well acted, there is not a strong enough backbone in the film to recommend it.
