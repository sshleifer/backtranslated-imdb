Less than 10 minutes in this movie I wanted it to end as it was painful. All this "horror" movie was about a group of complaining bitches who do stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let the positive reviews fool you, since it really is a terrible movie and you should not see it. <br /> <br /> The plot of the films had the potential to be something big, but it just does not happen. A group of five "teenage" girls drive home one night when they are being chased by a crazed driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes in the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a group of girls complaining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. None of the dialogues is even remotely interesting, so you do not really know these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and I was surprised to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women wore a day under 20, and one of them looked like she was almost 30 years old. At least get people who look like age. None of them offered performances that were not even remotely decent, and it seemed that they were selected from the street or that they were friends of the director without the capacity to act. The "actress" who played the killer was exaggerated, but at least showed something that the other girls did not show: a little talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help at all because these girls are. A bunch of stupid, weeping bitches. That's all I can say about them, and it did not help that EVERYONE survived. If I have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and their car is hit a lot. A girl gets hurt and complains about that ... four of them do not wear a seat belt ... what are you waiting for? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer ... and are you all just conveniently "too injured" to help? Whatever is. <br /> <br /> The filming of the film is absolutely terrible. I do not care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the footage was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed against a window somewhere and the number of times the camera was blurred, shook and brushed against an "actress" was horrible. It was also grainy and, sometimes, you could not hear what the characters were saying (not that it was worth listening to). <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the car of the murderers in the movie (who supposedly received the blow, even though we only heard the accident) is actually the director's car in real life. No wonder they did not show that the car was hit! This movie is so cheap, they can not even show that a car scratches a little. Oh, I have to mention the soundtrack too ... if that's what it was. It was horrible ... sad a second, and then rock hard the next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a group of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. It does not help when the script is terrible, the fear / tension / suspense and (almost not a gore to compensate) are absent, the performance is terrible and the quality of the image and the recording are terrible. <br /> <Br /> This was a horrible low-budget movie. Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
