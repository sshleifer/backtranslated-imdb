Even if 99.99% of the people who have seen this movie are Brazilian, I will continue with English since it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. The worst performance I've seen in a long time. The children are terrible. Especially the child. This was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a single tone of voice, like a 5 year old reading in front of the class. How can someone so bad be the main actor in a movie? The story is so superficial that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that it could be written on a napkin and counted in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teen; 2) Globo's stupidities have washed your brain so much that you think that anything that has the Globo seal is incredible; 3) you have severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs! A shame for the Brazilian film scene.
