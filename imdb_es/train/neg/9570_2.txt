For the first time in years, I felt the need to log in to IMDb today to cleanse myself of this movie when writing a review, because it was a disappointment to see it. The plot sounded amazing when I read it, I expected a minimum mystery thriller, a hunt for claustrophobic ghosts. Unfortunately, everything is so diluted by a worldly love story, exhausting and too many idiots and teeth crunching "nobody says things like this, except in bad movies", dialogues that is simply dying. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick summary of the worst offenses in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The script is largely based on the coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters which is simply laughable. No, actually, he's angry. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to that: Cheap emotion. A long parade of "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Very well, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced real human beings in real life, but has gained all his knowledge of bad movies. Therefore, their characters are boring, lifeless, second-generation clich√©s. They are mere devices of plot, owners of places without the slightest personality. They are "men and women in breakup who still love each other". I've never seen that before, except in 100,000 movies, and it's not becoming more realistic or pleasurable. Think of the dumbest two-dimensional Hollywood rate and you already have it. There is not a single character in this movie that is even remotely new, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - The vague and implausible resolution that swings very badly and needs only one push to knock down, although the word "resolution" may be inappropriate here, because the movie is a swampy mess that is not going to no part anyway. By the time you finish, however, you do not care anymore. The last third of the movie just went ahead, because it was so unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it. Whatever the redemptive features of this film, everything is buried under incompetence. Do not look at this turd.
