The movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of Carlson's Makson Island Raiders was made in 1943 with the goal of improving the morale of Americans during World War II. Demonstrate with the best way that the cinema can constitute propaganda body. The value of this film is only a collection and not artistic. In a propaganda film it is useless to judge the direction and the actors. Watch that movie if you're interested in how the propaganda works in the movies or if it's great fun with Robert Mitchum, who has a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, there are much better and more objective. I rated it 4/10.
