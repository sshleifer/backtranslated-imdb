Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, obsolete. <br /> <br /> The plot says that a mysterious vigilante woman ("Batwoman") is meddling in Batman's field, and while Batman is trying to fight a trio of Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, he is trying to find out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprisingly wrong with this, but there is nothing really special about this, either, since it stands out. <br /> <br /> The Phantom Mask caused Bruce's lost love to surface and mess with his head. <br /> <br /> The subzero was an important event in the life of Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Even the Batman Beyond movie goes out, Return of the Joker, deepening with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman had some subplots, a lot of formulas topped by a mediocre piece on a cruise ship. Frankly, this is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, without the blow and bite that the animated series had in its heyday.
