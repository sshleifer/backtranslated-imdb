College students, who are cleaning a condemned bedroom, are harassed by an elusive murderer. <br /> <br /> The bedroom that drips blood (also known as jokes) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The film production values ​​are quite low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there is even a creepy bum wandering around on a false track. In fact, much of the construction of the story is quite forgettable, except for one or two brutal killings. But the film is really enhanced by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and by a rather daring and unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is generally tarnished. Stephen Sachs is the best of all, as he makes a very good change of character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student. <br /> <br /> In all this is a fairly standard effort, but the end is worth savoring and for this viewer saved the film from being a complete ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
