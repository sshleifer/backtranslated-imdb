This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The rhythm and editing are a perfect introduction into a piece of ensemble, even better than saying Gosford Park. Then, inexplicably, it slows down, loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film only to recover the focus at the end with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle, there are too many margins and loose ends in history, several initiated threads are not finished. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS FORWARD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her after his relationship with her many years ago, despite the fact that he remarried and settled down at home in Morocco. As a builder, he now reconstructs his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Cécile's marriage. Having achieved this, he is buried after a strange accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. She wakes up only after she has burned her old image as an indication that they have reconciled with the past and can start their lives together again. ******* END OF THE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is not clear what vision this director wants us to see because there are many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there is frequent radio Transmissions over the overthrow of the previous Iraq regime. Cécile's son is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, while the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). His sister is traditional Islamic, and enters into relationship with the husband of Cécile. It portrays Morocco as an unnecessary retreat, despite the whole building there is a strange colonial vision that almost glorifies the past. It represents Islam as something backward and prone to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end, everything can be better described as adding a regional location and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material, they are so familiar that they can spin something extra in each scene: raise an eyebrow, body language, radiate pride, uncomfortable behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in today's world. With some notable exceptions of course.
