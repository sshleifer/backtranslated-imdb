Where to start? How about the wrong synopsis? <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the sinister Weapon X program." <br /> <br /> His epic violent past is exceptionally non-violent. <br /> <br /> Your relationship with Creed is so overlooked that it is difficult to understand how they have any connection. They throw us from a point in the initial scene that shows them as children in the race, to a montage of war scenes in which they have fought throughout their long lifespan, and finally to the present, where they are part of a government team unconditional. of the murderers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that shows your relationship as brothers. Nothing complex is established for us to believe that it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We throw ourselves into a romance so fast that it ends before you can blink. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox dies approximately fifteen minutes later. We are left wondering why we should worry about this. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For a fundamental element of this weak history driven by revenge, romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the woods to rot when she goes to look for Sabertooth. Being the romantic he is, this was something out of place for him, but it was necessary to serve the plot to achieve a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the X weapons program, let's say that after the painfully crippling Wolverine procedure is in operation. Finally, he arrives at the home of a suitably older but overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when they find a naked and sweaty man in his stable. Is it any wonder what fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comics, the main reason why the Wolverines' amnesia tormented him in part because he was said to be brutally evil and cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this was the case ... did you really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue your current more positive lifestyle of fighting the villains of the world along with your teammates? <br /> <br /> As implied in X2: X-men United when Stryker reveals some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be upset if he had known about the bad deeds they did together. This film prepares the team quite well, only they do not really do anything. There is no disturbing violence, no ruthless actions, they simply harass a few natives in foreign lands during the ten or fifteen minutes that are on screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead, he was constantly trying to give his brother Sabertooth a leash, which was consequently the violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. Finally, he simply leaves everyone together. <br /> <br /> Here there is no conflict of duality. <br /> <br /> Idiotically ELIMINATING that the character conflict of good and evil FULFILL the story immensely. They could also have given him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were many other mistakes in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the most incredible Deus Ex Machinas ever seen. a script. <br /> <br /> Magic that erases bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently, they are the only thing that can bring down Wolverine. However, he apparently forgot this when agent after agent was sent to shoot him down with bullets and bombs that surely will not work for him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it tried to focus on Wolverine. while pulling a ton of other mutants that did little or nothing. The interesting characters were mere showcases and did nothing for the story. Most were in the movie for 5 to 10 minutes at the most, and yet you find yourself wanting to see more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (the Blob, but not the comic version) can hit a tank missile launcher with little or no physical damage to him, but is a simple Wolverines metal noggin headbutt enough to stun him? ? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optical beams (which instead of being a concussion force) are now more similar to lasers) can burn through buildings, but when they shoot at Sabertooth directly, they just hit him against the ground without even damaging your clothes. Adamantium trenches, anyone? <br /> <br /> The mutant Gambit (which defies gravity), instead of using his signature cards, becomes a kind of crazy acrobat. In a badly edited scene, Wolverine leaves him unconscious ... then, surprisingly, a few minutes later, he finds himself on a rooftop running towards Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, escaped a few blocks, climbed a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match, is a mystery yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some have excused this Weakness of the films by claiming that it was made from a comic book and, therefore, should be weak in character and heavy in flash. The idea that this movie is a comic movie is fragile and superficial because that fact is incorrect. <br /> <br /> The source material of the comic, the true origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth taking to the screen. . It does not sweeten its past or treat the reader as meaningless CGI addicts. It is a well-crafted story and although it was re-told and readjusted over time, it started with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have that magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
