This is the best movie Derek has done and if you think it's a recommendation, then you have not seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it's as badly acting as his other efforts, we can see Bo undressing or auditioning for wet t-shirt contests quite often, the story is ridiculously ridiculous and the film takes itself too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But it has some things in its favor. Bo looks very good, the production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are pretty good, and this greatly improves your camp value. In a strange way, it's actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
