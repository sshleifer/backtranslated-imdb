I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "spiritual" New Age types, who, unlike me, really enjoyed this movie, although according to those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more than this nonsense), the movie is not so good. Therefore, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual," believe in or at least tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body," and you do not mind the frequent use of the term "energy" outside the context of physical or technology, you may like the movie, and you are likely to enjoy even more of the book on which it is apparently based. <br /> <br /> However, if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted with nonsense and inane New Age graphics, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance to the cheesy lighting effects to denote the fact of spirituality, and maybe even expect a reasonable dialogue of no wood, then This is my recommendation to you regarding this movie: Stay. Far. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. Tonight, this movie displaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I personally saw in a movie theater (I do not count the movies I went to watch with the expectation that they were bad, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, it increased the total of films that almost came out to two (D & D is the other). I do not leave the movies, not even this one, but I should have seen it the first time I saw the visual representation of an aura, because the BS of the New Age becomes increasingly thicker from that moment. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people involved with some ancient prophecies, in a search for spiritual enlightenment and with the aim of taking humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. Actually, they talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution, which should make anyone with the slightest idea of ​​what human evolution is shaking. The movie is full of hits with that kind of crazy. Occasionally, people turn to what they would certainly describe as "another dimension," or perhaps "another plane," only to become invisible to those around them who have not yet attained enlightenment. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director sponsors the audience by filming the "ideas" that make up the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better and more enlightened people. <br /> <br /> The good thing about the movie? Some very beautiful shots of nature, and some decent support performances by Elizondo and Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if he considers this movie interesting or acceptable. It really is the economic spiritism of the most naive, and unless it's your thing, it's better that you do something else with your time and money.
