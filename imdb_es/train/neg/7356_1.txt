I entered this movie, just when I was starting, on an afternoon when I was at home with a little flu, otherwise I would have missed it. It probably would have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas, both very good interpreters, and I thought it would be worth checking out. In a way, it turned out to be that way, but only because it's one of those horrible stories that fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents, except her Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson. breast. Unfortunately, his acting skills, at least here, make Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis in comparison. <br /> <br /> The white rat of the young walnut box, the owner's cat, the young walnut box that evicts the owner and restrained in his own house, and a lot of doophus (including the case of the young) in a facility of biological risk, and the absurd conclusion. I kept waiting for at least some scene or element of the plot to contain at least a minimum of realism, credibility or being able to evoke some empathy / sympathy, but this turned out to be in vain.
