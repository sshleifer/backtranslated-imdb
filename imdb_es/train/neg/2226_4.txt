The DD movies were damn cheesy, very stupid and had a plot that seemed very thin, but in those days it was at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy but a mix of melodrama, romance all <br /> <br /> All dramatic scenes are disproportionate <br /> <br /> Comedy is fun but corny. However, the movie keeps you entertained, those days Govinda's movies were loud, rude and yet they had some funny moments that people enjoyed <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is fine < br /> <br /> Govinda performs well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in some parts and annoying in parts Kader is as always Gulshan, Prem Chopra are pigeonholed Shakti is hilarious
