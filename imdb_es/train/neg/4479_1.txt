I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies in history. If not, then it is VERY close. Have you ever seen a bad teenage soap opera? Well, this is like one of those. Except the worst. For example: (POSSIBLE SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> boy: everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to go myself to a different place. <br /> <br /> boy: I will take you to another place. <br /> <br /> ... Following this line, they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personalities of the characters and events. Also, they just get rid of things. Also, the movie ends before the book ends. It is a horrible movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you have read the book, record (the movie). If you like stupid soap operas for teenagers that are of lower quality than those of your average low quality soap opera, do it. So, again, should we expect something different from MTV?
