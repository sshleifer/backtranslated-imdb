I watched most episodes of RMFTM as a teenager in the "Cliffhanger Theater" that ran after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then again when Mystery Science Theater made a riff in the early '90s. Time has not been kind. <br /> <br /> I can certainly make concessions for special effects, which were quite impressive for a low-budget 50 series (the flying scenes of the IMO Cody Command were better than those of George Reeves / Superman in their program of TV). And I can also make concessions to ahem, "act" and fight against choreography. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Men of the Moon. He is incredibly moody. He looks and acts like the guy who comes to fix your plumbing, not like the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the cheesy dialogue works well: everyone jumps out of their lines like chains of firecrackers, without wasting time or pauses for things like "thought" or "introspection". Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after a while, and even for my modern sensibility, it does not bother me much. <br /> <br /> What really irritates me is writing and conspiracy. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the moon, or rockets propelled with baking soda, or a flying suit that has the controls labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow". I do not even bother the content of the resolutions of the cliffhangers that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are stupider than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And for the fact that despite the fact that the dialogue is traveled like an express train, the plot follows the same movements over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his friend are the spearhead of a top secret high-tech science lab charged with protecting Earth (or at least the US) from an insidious one alien invasion. But his office does not have guards or security controls. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk ADEQUATELY and beat the shit out of Cody and his staff ... not once (maybe understandably) but VARIOUS times. They even kidnap their female assistant on the second try. And they never become smarter. To further demonstrate my point, let me point out the way Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around to get into trouble and never really seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does this over and over and over again. Cody also flies his boat to the Moon (the woman's assistant comes to cook), stays for about 30 seconds, turns around and returns immediately. Cody captures one of the atomic ray guns ... and immediately loses them again with the bad guys because he could not bother to block them. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to saving the United States from the Men of the Moon, he could ask for some soldiers with carbines, some helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, instead of working with the local police all the time. This was supposed to be a military operation, but they act as if it were another episode of "Gangbusters". <br /> <br /> Everything is hard enough to digest. I appreciate that the creators were very limited in the scope of their story because of the budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a pretty strong man (although he loses half of his fights). But I just can not help but shout "DOOR! CLOSE THE DOOOOR!" when the gang members simply enter their laboratory, or try to fly the ship and there are NO security measures in place of landing in their place ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Still, it's fine. Of the three serials of the Republic that I have seen, "Phantom Creeps" had a better plan, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (ha!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but it is a good waste of time . <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "Radar" men? They did not use the radar, they used atomic-ray guns. Should not the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
