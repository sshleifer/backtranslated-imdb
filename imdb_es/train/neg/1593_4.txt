Many of the main characters of the movie "Hitokiri" by Hideo Gosha in 1969 ("Manslayer", also known as "Tenchu" - the punishment from heaven) were real historical figures (in order of name "Western"): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji. The name "Hitokiri", a historical term, refers to a group of four super swordsmen who carried out numerous murders of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa shogunate in the mid-1800s under the orders of Takechi, the leader of the "loyalists". (ie, ultranationalist, pro emperor), clan faction Tosa. What was this fight about? Sad to say, you will not discover it in this movie. "Brilliant History Lesson" in fact! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual courtship and dice-cutting and (absurdly) the inner torment of the not-so-brilliant murderer Izo Okada than in revealing the real story. Sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical importance, considered to be the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Gosha closest to providing a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the loyal cause, comes to Takechi's mansion to try to influence him ideologically. It begins by talking about the international political situation, with foreign warships in the ports of Japan and a Japan that is too weak to defend itself militarily. Do you want to know more? Sorry. Gosha cuts this potentially fascinating lecture in the middle of the sentence (!). So much to inform your audience about a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The movie left me in absolute confusion about the goals of the two sides in this fight. During the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate had the central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change, to preserve the feudal relations of society. He feared outside contamination, both ideological and technological. According to this spirit, he banned firearms, those instruments of "leveling" in Europe and the Americas, with which a peasant could have confronted a samurai. Throughout this period, the Emperor was no more than a spiritual figure. <br /> <br /> But, in the cities, which were in neutral zones between the feudal fiefs, a new class of merchants, landowners and artisans was developing: - The class known in Europe by its French name, the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it crashed against the many confines of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became the central figure in the struggle of the bourgeoisie for power against the feudal aristocracy. But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves. When the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853, in the form of "Black Ships" by Admiral Perry of the United States, the ruling elite of Japan was caught in a crisis. His army was no match for these foreigners. In addition, they had heard of the ravages that the British and French imperialists were causing in China. What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements within the Shogunate, generally isolationist, were inclined to open trade with foreigners to obtain some of their advanced technology. This is the point of view represented (barely) in Sakamoto's film. On the other hand, ultranationalists loyal to the Emperor, represented by Takechi, believed that they could exclude foreigners by force, if only they could prevent the other faction from "selling the country." (Does it sound familiar?) Therefore, the murder of key figures of Shogunate is in order, and we leave. <br /> <br /> Takechi's motivations were, for me, the biggest enigma of the movie. Gosha suggests that he is fighting primarily for his personal advance rather than for the loyal cause. Can we take this to represent the tenor of the loyalists as a whole? (Do you mind?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers have favorably compared this film with "Goyokin", which Gosha did in the same year. But, where "Goyokin" is a crackling thread of suspense, with a hero worthy of sympathy, "Hitokiri" is laborious, it is not so convincing and lacks such a hero. Sakamoto could have been the hero of this movie, but we are not allowed to know him, or what he represents, enough to achieve that status. <br /> <br /> In view of his wonderful scores of five previous Kurosawa movies, Masaru Sato's score here was very disappointing, sounding like something rejected from a "Bonanza" episode. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
