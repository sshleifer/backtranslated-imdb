The film that films scenes of a tour through scenic caverns. <br /> <br /> Do not remind anyone of this movie, except for Michael Pataki, who shared extreme pain as JC in "Five the Hard Way". He is the really annoying sheriff who applauded when he practices a nightmare with our rabid doctor. Probably, most of the laughter you will have will be Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures from nowhere. Could Mrs. Beck be more wooden? Seriously, if you take a 4 foot branch, put it in a jacuzzi, you would not be able to notice a difference. Fear and suspense are looking at the clock and wondering when the credits will come out. <br /> <br /> Look at it like a night movie, MSTified, but do not get out of your way.
