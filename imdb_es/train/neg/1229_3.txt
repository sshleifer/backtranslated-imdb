I'm sorry, but other than Kim Basinger did a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a long time. The logic is discarded when 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a shopping mall full of people and then shoot a security guard. However, nobody seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or running back to the mall, she leaves and ends up in the woods with the boys in a chase. I can not even describe how silly it is to see this woman running away from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, crying out to God to help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me, this is bad and a little insipid too.
