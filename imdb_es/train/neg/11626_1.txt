This may be the worst show I've seen. Aside from the lack of flavor of having a comedy about Hitler, it's just not fun or entertaining in any way. It's very similar to a comedy from the 1950s in its cornball humor and ideated situations, but while it can be done as in I Love Lucy, it's not funny here. I think the program was based on the novelty "aspect, it's Hitler as a clumsy comedy figure", but it just fell flat on all aspects. The guy who plays Hitler is so hammy that it's hard to sit alone through that. I wonder what could have made the network think that this was a good idea to convey. I thought the United States had a show without flavor, but the British beat us this time. America would never broadcast a comedy about Hitler, although we did have that program about Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. You may never see this program, since it only broadcast one episode and probably will never be released on DVD.
