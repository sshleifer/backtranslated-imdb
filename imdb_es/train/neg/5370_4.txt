Råzone is a horrible movie! It's so simple It seems that they tried to make a movie to show the life of the reel. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is by many still the girl in "Krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. She plays several times in the movie with soul and this is destroying the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie you should see. I do not agree with young people behaving in this way, but I think you can show how you can finish, if you are disappointing your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film Folket"! <br /> <br /> in general, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a film that deals with important issues. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes, and actually, in these scenes, Laura is acting better. - Like the end where he is holding the gun!
