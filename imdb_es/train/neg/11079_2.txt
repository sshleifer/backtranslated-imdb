Over the course of several years in the search for decent medium-sized movies to rent for my children, I have developed a sixth sense to detect the really cheesy and direct efforts to the video that are really painful to watch (for anyone over eight). I dropped the ball on it and the kids spent half of the movie asking me "why did he say that?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes hurt to shoot them every minute, since the characters did a really bad job of introducing apparently random plot changes. And the next time someone decides they do not have any ability with a sword, it's simply "bringing realism" to a movie, pass it off as a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" It was the head and shoulders above this. Arrgh.
