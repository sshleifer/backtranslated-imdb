Children love dinosaurs. It is part of their culture. But they have The Land Before Time. The original. At least that movie had a heart. Is. This movie is just pathetic. The fact that children love dinosaurs does not mean that they can only slap any old story and show it to children. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more by the numbers. Not so sucking the soul as Theodore Rex, but it is light years away from being an Earth before time.
