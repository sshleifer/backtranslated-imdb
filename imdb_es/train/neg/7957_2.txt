Whoa In Twin Cities, we have a station that shows a "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. The nugget tonight was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's back" about a really annoying woman who ends up being killed when the thugs enter her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to torment her husband. She wants him to seek revenge against her killers, therefore, "she is back". And she will not let him rest until he does. She irritates him unceasingly ... and the spectators too! This movie is truly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. However, I like bad movies (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I really shook my head throughout the movie, wondering who thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so annoying. The plot is silly; the acting is bad; The story ... well, you understand me. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie, a really bad movie, take a look at this one. You will not be disappointed. Heh
