Everything about this movie was terrible. For starters, this movie had a pretty good cast and it seems impossible to make such a good cast in the biggest disaster of the gangster movie genre. The soundtrack was like one of the worst comedies. He had this music through the whole movie and it started to be quite annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLUGE WITH THIS DISASTER YOU WILL ONLY ARRIVE
