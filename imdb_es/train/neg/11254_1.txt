"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an incredibly incomprehensible title) is simply a bad movie; He has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that everything is filmed in a soft and annoying approach. In addition, the film uses music in the same way that, for example, "The Island of Gilligan" or the cartoons of Scooby-Doo: NEVER STOP. Terribly, just terrible. There are also no new ideas, only gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc., of bits taken from old movies and series. Here there is no doorman, the film seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.
