I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life, as well as for her talent as an actor. Therefore, I found it strange that she appeared in a movie that distorted the facts so much. The rescue of his character from the South Pole was made by a charter company in Edmonton, Alberta, flying in a Twin Otter aircraft designed and built by Canada. The trip had been rejected by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard. UU The same company organized a similar rescue a few years later to get a man out of the South Pole base. I feel that the film fairly represented a very exciting subject and documented a very brave woman who faces a terrifying task. I do not see why the producers would find it necessary to ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a Hercules of the USAF.
