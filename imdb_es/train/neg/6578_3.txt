Not entertained, without involving the hybrids of "cruel intentions" and "wild things", but it's not as good as any of those garbage classics. It involves the intervention of Sheriff Artie (Taye Diggs) to investigate an almost deadly drug overdose in an elegant upper class university, but to keep it at the lowest level. As you go deeper, think that it is much more than it seems at first glance. We follow Alicia, the girl who suffered an overdose in flashbacks as well. In about 90 minutes, if this movie was welcome to start, it would have been exhausted. This movie brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But it's the only movie so far that has Miss Swain topless, so the grade is higher just for that. <br /> <br /> My grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain has topless (fixing an error of "Happy Campers"); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-Eye candy: more men ass than tit girls
