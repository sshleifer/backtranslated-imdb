I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this movie crash and tricked poor Stevie Wonder into eternally matching her beautiful music with this theatrical disaster. I am also annoyed by the way he uses blasphemy as part of the normal prose of black professionals. Abuse of his dominance over ethnic film fans is a shame. The scenes that seem to have been created in blue and have nothing to do with the theme or the sub-themes, are reproduced as if a university kid wrote this. I especially detest the absurd scene in which the two protagonists are playing sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and mistreat Snipes. The overacting of potential customers makes one feel as if Spike does not respect his viewers or has no idea what a movie is. The final scene seems to have been thrown to justify the use of a hammer to mark a point. This film also supports the myth that all people in the culture use the word F in an informal conversation. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same group as this one, where he is not growing as a filmmaker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a success. He should dedicate himself to making documentaries like The Four Colored Girls. Shock films do not make an Oscar.
