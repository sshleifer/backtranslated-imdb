Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to see this movie. The story is very thin, and once the friends of the Air Force return to the States with a Cobra curse on them, the action is just a waiting game. Look at Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
