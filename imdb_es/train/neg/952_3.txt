Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent for everyone, including the audience. The lightness of the lines of the frame of mistaken identity of the old hat and the scandal of imitation is absolutely forgivable. Very few people saw these films because of their plots. But, generally, they had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots, not here. In general, they had interesting choreographies, impressive dances and catchy songs. No Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana desperately looking for a star to play, and instead, they called her to take her, and she could not do it. The Scottish place wasted. In general, the Scottish's graceful omnipresence is automatically absent. The photograph was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. CÃ©sar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing the stage, since no one else was doing his part, in the type of role of producer frequently tested by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine, and no one could make David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven as I do, it's enough reason to lose 90 minutes in Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
