I had the greatest enthusiasm in the advanced projection of this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say it was a big disappointment. They made the plot completely a joke and turned the thing into a long telenovela. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot scattered so disorderly that the audience laughed many times before the stupid script that was limited to pay attention to this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of powers almost like the Matrix, an absolute cruelty and male lovers in the original poem) resort to "Fabio on the beach", disguised as Pitt (who a good script and a greater effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure that Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were really decent, trying to get the best out of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it with LOTR or Gladiator and not even hold a candle. A lot of handles for the ladies to pass the glasses, but there are not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about a long battle and a siege. I would not recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged by dirt as it was one of the characters (at least they did it correctly).
