It would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say that this could be a good show. This show is only good if you do not know what the "talent" is ... I will not even say what is offensive (I know it can be offensive to many people) because that is not really what bothers me about the program ... What It's annoying that people see this and think it's funny ... It makes me feel that our generation is getting stupid and I'm really afraid that someday people will see this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple ... it is an offensive, self-centered and spoiled woman (Sarah Silver Men) overcoming everyday life .. <br /> <br /> That's right ... I Like it has not been done a million times ... In fact, almost all the jokes have been made or are racist ... <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing ... I like her voice ... that's ... not the lyrics ... The lyrics are terrible ... who likes to sing about a lot of things ... <br /> <br /> If you like to see a sexy woman shoot down to all l O others and make yourself feel like shit while at the same time you fart and say things about each race, then this show is for you ..
