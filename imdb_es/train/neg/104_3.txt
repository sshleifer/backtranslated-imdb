On the way to a small town that lies off the beaten track (but which seems suspiciously close to a highway), a reporter meets a strange hiker who agrees to help her direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a couple of gruesome tales related to the area: in the first story, an adulterer couple conspired to kill the woman's husband, but in the end they suffered a much worse fate when they were attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers shorten their vacations when an undead person is opposed to looking at his grave. <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes. When making a zombie themed anthology, it's a good idea, but with only two stories, it's woefully short. And that's not the only way that this low-budget movie does not work: the acting is terrible (with Joe Haggerty, as the narrator Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I've seen); the places are not inspired; the script is lugubrious; There is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end ... well, that belief of beggars. <br /> <br /> To be fair, part of the creative work of Sykes' camera is effective (although the trick technique used when the characters run through the woods is a bit abused, and Joe Castro's cheap Castro is enthusiastic: cut an ear, tear off the eyeballs, remove a face, crush the brain and there is a disorderly beheading.These positive aspects almost make the film bearable, but be careful, The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, even for the experienced viewers of the z-grade garbage. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but I generously raised my rating to 3 since I could not watch the movie with the benefit of 3D (although I suspect that an additional dimension would not have made a big difference).
