This movie has no argument or character development or budget. It really sucks to put it in short terms. Since there is no development for the movie, you can not really see how to try to be artistic or try to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons to possibly see it. To be in shock or to leave like a sick monster. Well, it falls short here, too. The girl's reactions just seem silly. It's extremely easy to say that it's fake (honestly, professional wrestling seems more realistic than the shit they're trying to cope with in this movie.) They pull her insides, but she's asleep most of the time, so she's a bit silly. The only one really worth a part is the end when they are quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle comes in. But, honestly, the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, with the exception of the eye film about torture, go see the hostel and hostel 2. Not only do they contain realistic violence, but there is also a real story that attracts you and makes you worry about people. deepest level considering issues such as American fears of foreigners, problems of morality, proving how far a person can go, human instincts and civilization, and many In addition, they are written with care and contain some good humor when the story is not focused on v iolence These are much better options on this piece of trash
