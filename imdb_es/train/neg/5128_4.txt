This early entry of B into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney in ads and posters, but you have to wait a long time before seeing her, traveling on a camel train in Hollywood. Previously, we established George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must join in the attack. I've seen Sanders with so many nice cads that it was fun to witness the turn of an exceptional guy. However, the attractiveness of Bruce Cabot is a mystery to me, in comparison, it is nothing subtle, but I always felt that he had emerged, smiling, under a car, covered in grease and with a sixth grade education. Some people like it that way, just like the character of Gene's gypsy queen. This is a filler of adventure and action, and, just when we have been warned to invade the locals with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their land, there is a final battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of everything This function requires nothing more than your attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who made everything else match better. It was almost more interesting to identify the great cast of cast and a surprise appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of his first roles. One or two or two and a half stars in five.-MDM
