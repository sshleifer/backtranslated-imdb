really horrible ... the main actor did well ... the movie, the plot, etc. it was completely bad and inaccurate, it could have been a sequel to ... anything that had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided like the plague by Carlito's fans ... not to mention Gail, in fact, he ends up with some other bird, not to mention Klienfelt, not to mention how he was caught, not to mention how he ended up in jail. .. they tried to do it like the original with flash backs at the beginning ... but to be honest in qualifying, I was looking for a brand of zero ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to take advantage of what was one of the best films of the 90s ... in general, it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action" on it, it was really boring slow and predictable ... again for any fan of Carltio's Way to avoid this fiasco ...
