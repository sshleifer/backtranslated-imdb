When talking about great combinations of director / actor on the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the departure of nine joint ventures between the two covers the gamut from really good to mediocre entertainment. Unfortunately Kinjite: The forbidden subjects falls into the latter. <br /> <br /> That's sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But, for my life, I do not understand why it was necessary to convert the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy accustomed to having a bit of fun because the romance in his marriage is over. That could have been good for another movie, but it did not help. <br /> <br /> A direct police drama with Charles Bronson as vice president who has seen too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against the orientals. That part could also have used a bit of explanation too. But he will have to overcome it if he and his fellow patient Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese girl. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time on the vice team told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A killer and elegant pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the boy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, in the best scene of the movie, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez saw Bronson and Lopez at a delicatessen store all night and this was the next. his rolex sandwich, sprinkles the place with an Uzi killing everyone, except Bronson and Lopez. I really think that that little incident would have had more than a couple of LAPD cops after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is still a very hard justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie had been better. This was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and the last of J. Lee Thompson as director. I should have come out with something better.
