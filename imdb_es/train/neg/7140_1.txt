You know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should include one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should not only be victims of violations, but are also the only actors and real actors in them. So how on Earth, Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever, could allow those people to get in touch with their cars and ruin their reputation for which they give millions? Stop getting an advantage of cars and make money in your coffers. It is painful for car lovers. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want to get my money back !!!
