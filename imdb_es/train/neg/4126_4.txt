Absolutely nothing happens in this slow, annoying and emotionless thriller directed by Amenabar's regular collaborator, Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow treats the effect of boredom and the search for emotions, actually offers nothing and seems an exercise in boredom. The only slightly entertaining moment is the climax of the movie, which takes about 30 seconds of agony over 100 minutes, and is solved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the way in which the story unfolds is arbitrary and each device or plot of the plot is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or ingenuity. If you are a fan of the genre, look at "Thesis" instead.
