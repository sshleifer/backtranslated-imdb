After watching the trailer of this movie and discovering that Spike Lee was directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I was not alive at that time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more than a history lesson than anything else. What I got was an interesting performance, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of film that really had something to do with Sam's Son. I guess the movie was not about Sam's Son, but it was a look at the summer of '77. Etiqu√©tame disappointed. <br /> <br />
