I've seen a lot of garbage in my day, but by God, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free projection in NY the other night. I can only hope that they show the funny version to paying customers. The big laughs were scarce, the plot was not interesting and the characters were one-dimensional at best. A highlight is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. I had no price and it was the only scene I really laughed at. Apart from that, I can only remember randomness and dead air. Fans of SNL and Samberg may be disappointed. I know I expected more of that. But in summary, I definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this movie.
