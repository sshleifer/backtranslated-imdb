First of all, yes, I am white, so I try to step lightly on the delicate subject of the race ... anyway ... White people who hate blacks = BAD, but blacks hate white people = well (because apparently we deserved it !!). Where do I start? I wish I had something good to say about this movie other than the unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and company. fight with some really big, very strong, really angry and spooky Neo-Nazis and win! the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the pursuit! the persecution is priceless ... This is NOT a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it is not fulfilled ... this is a racist film that reaffirms all stereotypes of clich√©s, the white and maddening guy who is mistreated by his partner Black quarter automatically transforms into a skinhead ... cmon just horrible I regret having seen it. <br /> <br /> Save time and the terrible experience of a badly written image, badly acted, boring and clearly skewed, if you're in the subject, go and rent American History X, now that it's a movie
