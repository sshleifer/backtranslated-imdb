I find it encouraging and inspiring that the team of writers behind such largely irremediable Hollywood films like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DEATH, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK start their career with a low budget exploitation horror movie like this . Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but unfortunately it becomes frustrating exactly because he can not muster the cinematic prowess to achieve it. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a young woman who travels to a small coastal town in search of her father painter who disappeared a while ago. The fragmented narrative does not take long to abandon all hope and plunge into an absurd bewilderment, and for a time it works admirably well to the point where you begin to think that perhaps the Messiah of Evil must be recovered from the overcrowding disorder of the exploitation of the 70s as an example of mysterious mystery. <br /> <br /> The surreal non-minions continue to pile up while the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room in the city to conduct an investigation into the local. The legend of the 'moon of blood', a disheveled and half-crazy alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene in the film) who warns him about his father and who was reportedly found dead in an alleyway. A little later, the blind lady who owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed from the shop all the paintings of her father and, last but not least, a murderous and ardent albino who eats squirrel. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of the movie is precisely this bran. D of artistic surrealism of gangue-basement that defies logic and gender conventions every step of the way. While with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the "intentional", the "unintentional" and the "no" really expected it to come out this way, but it's good enough. 'Defocus desperately. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the double narration that flows in and out of the image in a feverish way, with current of conscience, with drugs, that comes from the daughter while she moves away from her place to search to his father, and the other narrated by the voice of his father while reading his diary. <br /> <br /> While we are still talking about an image of 'undead', Messiah of Evil is different and just plain simple, at least with the current preconceptions of what is supposed to be a zombie movie . The origin of the undead here is a 100-year curse, awarded to the city by a mysterious "Dark Stranger" who one day came from the forest. Meanwhile, Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a scene at a meat supermarket that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD for a number of years (you can already hear the MST3K line: 'the man is dead, only its capitalist food the cans remain ') and a similar scene very well thought out but badly executed in a cinema. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that surrealism works in careful and well-measured doses. How does the absurd work if it is not hidden? within what is perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to simply stain him all over the image and by doing so he overexcites his hand dangerously. When the albino, for example, picks up a girl who goes to the city and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own thoughts. <br /> <br /> The overall level of film production is also quite low: after half the way, the rhythm gets confused and the story is tedious and evidently goes nowhere and is not particularly fast. Add to that the choppy edition, the average performance and Hyuck's general inability to capture the true atmosphere, the empty streets of the coastal city are badly criminally used, and he would file Messiah under "lost opportunity" but still, fans of the grindhouses will find enough to appreciate it, even though it is not particularly bloody, of poor quality or sordid.
