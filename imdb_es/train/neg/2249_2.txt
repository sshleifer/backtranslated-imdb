This is a horrible disaster of a movie. From beginning to end, it is full of bad performance and even worse direction and editing. The only exchangeable parts of the film are some numbers of Streisand, because the parts of Kristofferson are impossible to see or to listen. The main problem with this film is that we never see the character of Kristofferson in his prime or the character of Streisand fighting. The first should be in decline and the second on the rise. The final Streisand number could have been one of the best endings of the film, if it was directed and edited correctly. The only framed photo of his face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the stage plans had been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by the dropping out of NYU. The only worse thing can be the unfortunate script. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is totally destroyed by wrong technical decisions.
