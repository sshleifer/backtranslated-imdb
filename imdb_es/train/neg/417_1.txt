I get to the movies more or less every week, and I regularly visit this site, but I have never felt obliged to comment on a movie before. <br /> <br /> To my list of all the incredibly bad movies: Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector: now I can add the nonsense that was 'Hollow Man'. <br /> <br /> Of the terrible opening titles: a ridiculously long cast of the cast and crew created with Alphabetti. spaghetti - to the final insult - a world record number of clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and acts that have come to the movies - this movie is depressing, and only the stunning computer graphics prevent you from leaving long before the movies. End. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion, it was that of my friends and everyone around us. When large parts of an audience laugh and moan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, she was also sick. The director took the action beyond the realistic rate limits for a violent movie, and entered the realms of a B film bathed in blood. It is hard not to imagine the director as a kind of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's incursions outside the laboratory and into the outside world extended only to two attempts to feel some breasts. Perhaps sex could be the first thing in the mind of a boy if it is made invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes the cinema entertaining. <br /> <br /> [the spoilers are still] <br /> <Br /> Overcoming the sick films outside, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job acting increasingly crooked as a "hollow man", the rest of them, perhaps handicapped by terrible writing, do an even better job of being hollow cast. A longtime team member is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, "He finally broke down," he shrugs a colleague without a hint of emotion. This is on par with the course, and the lab team oscillates between absolute terror and complete indifference with such speed that one wonders how they got involved in the performance. They made their way through the lab corridors in terror, weapons ready, but seconds later, one of the crew members jumped happily down the corridor to get blood for an injured colleague. The leading woman treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humor, even after he insulted her and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to her outbreaks, even after she drowned the Pentagon chief: "He drowned in his pool last night, "reports the same female, spectacularly, fails to join two and two. <br /> <br /> The script is riddled with this kind of misunderstood pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of film clichés, which get thicker and Faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and fun at the end. <br /> <br /> The 'eureka' moment on the computer, the nude woman in the window, the looping security video: the list is really endless: the predictable contempt for strength in numbers, the decision to not kill the two main stars, but simply put them in a place of probable imminent death and leave them to their fate, the good man almost dead that appears from nowhere to save The woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous country. Timer, the explosion of the fireball that just burned before reaching the heroes, the fall that stops before hitting them and, most of all, the immortality of the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The invisible man is burned halfway with an improvised flamethrower, electrocuted, hit the head with a bar that he had just cut through one of the minor actors, and after having apparently survived the Explosion, the fireball and the total destruction of the laboratories, has more than enough life to climb through the fireball for a final outbreak in the heroes of the movies, in whose setting the unbelieving public shrinks in fear and look at their watches. <br /> <br /> That this exceptionally bad movie really did it for The cinema is amazing. Even the name of the film is as useless as the film itself, and even impressive special effects do not come close to saving it, which must be avoided at all costs.
