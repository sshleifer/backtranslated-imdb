He saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. Not so much based on the director, who had not made a film release before, but more based on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (main role in Body double, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) have starred in major films. However, not together, and this fact has not changed exactly because of this. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that can make it a bit attractive is the selection of places where it has been shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this.
