I give this pretentious piece of junk a 1 simply because I do not think there is a worse movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, configuration, writing and leadership. I hope that everyone involved in this film will burn and rot in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Damn this unpleasant waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this film is just a product of my imagination. I pray that I have dreamed about the movie and so that I will never have to see it again in <br /> <br /> my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
