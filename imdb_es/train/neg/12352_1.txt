<br /> <br /> The way this movie got an average of 6 stars surpasses me. The script is so banal and, frankly, an insult to the life on which it is based. The cinematography comes directly from the skilful world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should feel ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show any surprise when participating in this movie, if one looks at her list of songs. In short, a "high concept" style movie that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
