The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of VHS made me buy and watch this movie, hoping to see a good teenage movie. What a crap! Is the script full of clich√©s, dialogues and performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, horrendous? In short, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, in fact three couples, together as a group of friends, but in fact very unpleasant people who seem to be enemies, playing a ridiculous and pointless game called "Taboo", and with each of them writing yes or not for Certain taboo issues. That is: there is no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationship. Then, there is an ellipsis a year later, and the same group meets at a New Year's party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and the turns are so ridiculous, foreseeable, mediocre and incredible that they do not deserve any additional line in my review. One tip: do not waste your time or your money on this garbage, you will surely regret it. My vote is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo Playing with the Killer")
