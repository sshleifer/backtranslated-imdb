I will not comb the obvious peterbogdanovichianas flaws of the TLPS. Instead, I'll take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated film celluloid. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a film that can be supported in its entirety. Only this fact places the film on top and to the top of its scant filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich had shown how staggeringly generous some successful boyfriends can be in sharing the fabulous body and breasts of Cybill Shepherd (his then gal) with his male audience, and not just in one but in Two occasions. Brava The most indisputable of this festa of the cinematographic siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS just has a scene without stereotypical country music scribbling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the film is set in the Deep South of the United States (as if it were not an obvious bleed), so he insisted on that again and again ...) How is this an advantage? ? ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and monotonous country music finally stops massaging your tired ears, you begin to experience a strange euphoria: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. I hope that they can also, one day, snatch a much younger and even handsome boyfriend. <br /> <br /> 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize is not technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all the women who look like this, so that one day they can also win a contest of beauty of Miss Chicago. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury). <br /> <br /> (You think I'm joking about Cloris who won a beauty contest, right? Well, look at her biography and then we'll see who laughs last ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was filmed in black and white, which prevented us from seeing the face of Cloris Leachman in his original and natural non-glory.
