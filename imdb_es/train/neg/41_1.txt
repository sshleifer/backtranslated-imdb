How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? When you can not stop laughing at that, of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I will only add a few things to the hilarity of all this. <br /> <br /> Some comments have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought. It was on some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this takes place, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is made up of a couple of black women, some black men and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa beating the drums ... the Devil God is a big black man with a terrible case with pink eyes. <Br /> <br /> One of the "strangest" moments of the movie is when "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered in what appears to be an orange substance that I guess is blood, which starts scream for minutes and more. (that's really funny), and then the boss of his partner falls to the ground and "Pablito" kicks him a little for what I guess is "shit and giggles" and the eyes really move ... <br /> < But, of course, then the "freak" disappears when you realize that the eyes moved because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I had not laughed like that in a long time, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... take a box of beers and start watching this movie, you'll love it! However, if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, do not worry.
