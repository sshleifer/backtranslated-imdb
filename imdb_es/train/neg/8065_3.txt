Steve Carpenter can not make horror movies. First, the casting was very bad for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movie has no gore (usually a key ingredient in a horror movie), no action, no acting, no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and simple in this that he is sad. There were some parts that were supposed to be fun (continuing with horror / teen comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie had an R rating, and I did not pay attention to it and I realized that it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway, see this movie if you liked it. I still know what he did last summer. That's the only kind of person who would find this film even remotely terrifying. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like the Texas massacre.
