It is a good movie for children who love dogs. It runs a little slow at first, but it ends if a burst of Gooped hit De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is the bird that speaks and thinks it is a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It is the comedy that the film needed most. Watch it in the morning session so you do not have to pay the full price or wait for it to appear at Disney.
