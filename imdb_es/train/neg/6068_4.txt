Vodka Lemon is a lovely Arminian film, but extremely uneven, which will delight some and bore others. Although reasonably well crafted, the film lacks a true "zing", relying instead on many scenes that will seem like a commonplace for the cunning art viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of pure cinematographic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many points of view disoriented and, ultimately, unhappy. You can laugh, but these moments will be few and far between a sea of ​​snowy landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus trips. A noble effort, made ultimately by the lack of narrative cohesion.
