I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a big disappointment. Disappointment because the story was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate film was exciting and, as a fan (sounds perverted, I'm not!) Of 'rape / revenge' movies of the 70s It was unnecessary. Very curious to say this movie. My conclusion: let's continue with the classics! Yes, the story has potential but the dialogues are flat, the actors are not convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it is a correct representation of the university world in the USA. UU., That the void of the characters has a purpose and all that jazz, but it only makes the whole movie insubstantial. Like the scene in which they rape Dawson: seriously he lacks intensity! I did not expect anything in the 'irreversible' style, but still, are not we supposed to feel compassion for it? I did not do it. Not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the picture was awesome. Well, it's good in fact, but nothing innovative either. I must admit that the screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the film, I could not help but think "I want to see" Argento's Hell again. hahaha More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully filmed and in all, but I had the bitter feeling of seeing a longer and boring version of the scene in the dirty bar near the US-Canadian border in "Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with "Lynch on Lynch. I '... the crude lighting of red and blue, the heavy bass music, the general lewd / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into this movie. Too.
