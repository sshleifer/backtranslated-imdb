['Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980s, Personal Best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as one more phase that experimental of Cahill&#39;s life. <br /><br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film launched the same-sex relationship between two attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping back over a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY SMALL relevancy for the movie and it seemed that this had been done simply to keep the audience interested in this bland film. I suppose the producers were trying to counter the boring plot and even more boring configuration of the film (the 1980 Oregon track and field competition). <br /><br /> This revision may seem hard, but it is the truth. The exploitation of the body of the young Muriel Hemingway and the relationship between people of the same sex ruined any credit that had given to this film. <br /><br /> Pepper Thompson']
