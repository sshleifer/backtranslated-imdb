This must be re-titled "The curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a person who did not hate snorers like a shock movie." It's a long and boring story of a frat of frat, a joke so transparent that even Flounder of Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the installment stage, can be forgiven for taking any job he can get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously acted for film heavyweights such as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but, fortunately, not on DVD. Misrepresented garbage like this belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
