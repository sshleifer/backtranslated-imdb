I really wanted like this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and Spenny Rice has a lovely side to him. It's not like I like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. I should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend present the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's pretty boring apart from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really are not too many celebrities in this movie, and most do not seem to say more than one line. In general, this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest seeing it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes free on the third album). Regardless of this production, I'm still very excited to see The Paper Chase.
