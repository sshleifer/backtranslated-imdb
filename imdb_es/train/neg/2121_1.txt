Frankly, it also seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What about Will Smith that I can not take anymore? I guess it seems he's too determined to be taken seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how biased this is, but unless you submit to some new acting lessons, I can never see you winning one. It is a huge name and, therefore, is generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He just is not I give him credit for trying so hard, and for being able to cry with the blink of an eye. That is all. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds were a kind of admirer for me, from the beginning. The suicide call to 911 did not intrigue me in any way. He was not curious to know why he called his own suicide. There was absolutely no surprise. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent chemistry on the screen. Also, I do not know her name, but the Hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a frightened and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screen time, but I would say he stole the program when he was on the show. <br /> <br /> In general, only an extremely simple non-original plot. I could not help but wonder all the way why I cared about any of these people. I never felt sorry for 'Tim / Ben'. Did he commit suicide with a jellyfish? Was he the only survivor in an 8-person accident? Geewiz ... did not see any of that coming ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
