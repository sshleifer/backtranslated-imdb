First of all, let me say that the first 20 minutes are excellent, the monster looks excellent and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame that the rest of the movie is a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS DOWN ******** <br /> <br /> De La escena Initial that we can see in this film is anti-American, normally this type of stereotypes would not bother me (the British get enough of Hollywood), but in this case it is not subtle to make Americans go crazy. He goes beyond the point of realism and his left asks if a Yankee has raped the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The mourning scene was very poor and the part of the movie where it starts to go downhill. <br /> <br /> Here we meet the Olympic medalist and the drunken uncle who enter the memorial and begin to blame the father for the death of his daughter, then they beat him before they all start shooting the ground crying. Hardly a realistic union in a moment of crisis! <br /> <br /> The entire sideline of the virus is ridiculous. If Americans know there is no virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The agent of the US government UU He orders the brain piercing of an innocent Korean for nothing, which makes Americans look evil (or stupid); It did not help the fact that this guy was bizorado for a comical effect. <br /> <br /> The movie is about monster hunting. The special forces of the United States and Korea are assigned to find the creature, although in the whole film they are invisible. The only people who hunt the monster, in all of Korea, are the main family and a random vagabond who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally, a few American / Korean agents try to stop them on the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was only included in the film so that she could make the vital shot at the end. It was a clich√©, you knew it was going to happen, but to make matters worse, she does everything possible until that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that child survive in the end? The monster had been swimming with his head underwater for about 5 minutes! Why did not the monster eat the children in the first place?
