Another speedy villain of Grade Z of the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch-like policeman from outer space chases an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and engages in a gang war in the South Bronx! Mercifully brief, but deadly boring, with the most kitschy effects since the 50-foot Women's Attack. They should also have fired the continuity guy: notice how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappear in every second shot. Laughing badly, but that's why we see these movies, is not it? Sequel'Dollman vs. Reportedly, Demonic Toys is even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
