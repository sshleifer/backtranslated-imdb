This had high intellectual pretensions. The main leader tries to give a "deep" "meaningful" interpretation (voiceover for his moods naturally) and was certainly influenced by the "method" of the fifties and sixties, which, when the script and the direction that was worth it gave amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the story is abysmal. Also, it moves too slow, it could edit at least 20 minutes, including nonsense flashbacks, and the plot line would not be changed. Sometimes, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his character "Uncle" and his interpretation often in parody. An interesting side is only overlooked: the youth / hero relationship, if we admit that the hero is himself. type of child: when he tells the child that he would not let anyone hurt him, something of welcome tenderness arises. But it is failed and only the final scene returns to him. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Instead, take "a short distance" from Foley: you have two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an unconventional movie, but it's exciting , thriller. Here, my hitchcockometer aims surly towards zero at all times.
