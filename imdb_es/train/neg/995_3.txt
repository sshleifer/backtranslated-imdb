Rosario Dawson plays a girl who is raped and then starts decent in the dark until she is given the chance to get revenge. While it's clear why Dawson took the role, it's an opportunity to show off his acting skills and make a small independent film, decidedly not Hollywood, but it's also clear that, apart from stunning beauty, Dawson seems out of place on the paper. Forgive me, I just could not find it. That's not a mistake, that's how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know it's on the screen, but even though I spent most of the two hours watching it, it did not leave any impression on me. I blame the script for this since, apart from the ending, it does not seem that a large number of what happened on the screen seems to have a real meaning. People seemed to have a more than real posture and what happened did not seem to fit. Forgive me for being lazy, but nothing in this movie, except the ending (which I would love to talk about but I can not cause it to spoil), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me. What can I say , this can click with you, maybe not, for me it's time I can not go back. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, although be careful, there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario- please, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
