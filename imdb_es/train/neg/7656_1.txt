Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. I remember spending whole nights in front of the PC screen, trying to escape from that mansion and really startle me at times when the monsters were surprisingly charging. Now, look: I'm tired of the movies "generated by computer games". I do not remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to see them. And yet, I'm such a fan of the game that I could not resist. My reasoning was that if the movie had an argument that resembled more the game, it would be fine. <br /> <br /> Man, those were 90 minutes (what seemed like 300) of my life that I will never go back. If I had that opportunity, I would gladly have spent them rearranging my sock drawer. This is not even in the category "so bad that it's fun". One would think that even Christian Slater had a little more sense than to join this smell bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this girl in a leading role is to have a sex scene, which I understand and support (hey, I'm a boy!), I've seen more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to speak. You will not waste your time throwing it. The credibility of the story sinks below: "I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinski." The acting is not more than a few marks over 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend ABOUT THIS. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend the Video Game. It has much better story, acting and many more emotions. As for the movie, here is a spoiler: STINKS! Wait for the porn version
