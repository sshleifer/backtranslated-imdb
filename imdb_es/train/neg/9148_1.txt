I was looking at the last 100 of Imdbs because I thought I had never seen anything as bad as Plan 9 from outer space or the Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur have defeated both. <br /> <br /> This one of the innumerable amount of movies I've seen is the worst number one movie in history I've seen. Bad direction, bad characters, horrible acts, horrible story There's a reason why nobody, except Sam, says anything positive about this movie. Sam was a horrible and annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that maybe he could overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The Director should feel ashamed of his work. Unfortunately, I have to give it at least 1 star, but it deserves ... The stars will continue.
