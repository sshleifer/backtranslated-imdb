Yes, this movie makes me feel a real horror, when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to see it. The bald guy only gives me the impression of being a psychopath: the actor Junkie and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time to avoid this film, I understand that a film requires money to be created and some films do not have that money, but that is not a justification for a stupid plot and a bad performance. I'm always supporting independent films, when it deserves support, but movies like this make a bad name for this type of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will not trust any nice cover anymore.
