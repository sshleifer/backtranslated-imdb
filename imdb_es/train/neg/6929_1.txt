I read the reviews of this movie and decided to give it a try. After all, I'm an open-minded guy and I've given good reviews to some pretty bad movies. As the final credits went in this one I looked for a meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This movie was mercifully short." That is all that I have. <br /> <br /> It's okay, it's fine. The scenarios and the visual elements were well done and the music helped to create the mood of the asylum life, but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue turned away from the good parts. I found myself laughing at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who was ashamed in front of a large crowd. <br /> <br /> At the time of the "chicken dance" at the end I had just decided to get in and roll with the movie and let the bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. The performance was not bad and it seemed like it had a budget, but there was simply no way to make it visible; Not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have triggered a doobie or drank a LOT of beer to get the full movie experience. Either way, I will not see this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say to myself: "At least I was not in 'Dr. Tarr's torture dungeon." I'm better than those guys. "
