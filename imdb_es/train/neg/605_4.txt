I'll keep this short since a movie like this does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the configuration, this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Project of the Blair Witch" <br /> <br /> During the first 20 minutes of the film, I was really excited, the director did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I do not think he managed to capture the real concern of an empty London subway. <br /> <br /> The characters were a big disappointment. Our "heroine" in this movie is a piece of worthless shit, and you really do not care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was encouraging the homeless and the black man, who managed to giggle me or two (whether intentionally from the writers or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain, remains in the dark during the first half of the movie, but when he reveals himself, I was very disappointed. I will not spoil it, but let's say my 10-year-old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another mediocre horror film that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood Formula. This movie had great potential, but it really did not achieve the goal. <br /> <br /> Just to highlight how scarce this movie was, the characters in this movie were at least FIVE TIMES to finish and kill the main villain. .
