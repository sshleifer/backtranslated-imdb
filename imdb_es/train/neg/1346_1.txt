Dear friends and family: <br /> <br /> I suppose if a teenager wants to be biblical with another teenager, that is his eternal condemnation: just remember the children, "birth control" does not mean "oral sex", I do not care what the honor student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's help cites himself as "a kind of romantic man," he is still hitting a high school girl. If she were my sister, I would eat these guys' knees. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I discovered that Mongolians do not kiss in the same way as Frenchmen and baseball players called Zoo as delicate underwear. <br /> <br /> I think I would almost rather see Richie Rich once again suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slap. Thank you and good night.
