I was very excited to see this movie, anticipating a visual journey about the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, containing the types of wisdom like "Rivers and tides". However, that is not what I received. Instead, I receive a rather uninspired movie about how human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly an unorthodox claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to be in conflict about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed "ethical" duty he has towards the workers who occasionally populate the images, along the periphery. And frankly, the images in general were not that impressive. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all respects, a stupid movie. For people who want to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not for those who want to think about the complexities of the problems that surround them.
