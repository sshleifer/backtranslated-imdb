Well, EYEboy, I must say that I am not at all pleased when someone chooses me and tries to make fun of me, especially when it's someone who seems as smart as you are. My favorite part of your post was "But there's no big bang bang good-guy bad guy here, kimosabe, I suggest you limit yourself to the movie with a lot of bang bang". <br /> <br /> Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have much action, as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies does not fit into that category and it's just a very bad movie. I do not really see a lot of non-American movies, so maybe they screwed me up, and I did not realize how bad foreign films were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Maybe if I judge foreign films according to a different standard, someday I could see how Secrets and Lies could be one of the best rated films in the IMDB. Hmm ... If it's true, that's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
