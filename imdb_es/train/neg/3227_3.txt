This is a delivery in the notorious Guinea Pig series. A Japanese television program of short duration, which was canceled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired by the murder of a young schoolgirl in the program. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any history. A group of boys has captured a young woman. They tie her up and torture her to death while they film her. They beat her, they poured boiling oil on her, they put tweezers on her, and finally, in the "loving" foreground, they put a needle in her eye. This is the simplest of all the guinea pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this movie, more than any of the others, that gave Guinea Pig the rumor of being tobacco. Certainly they gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage's film "8 mm". These movies have become very popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished but equally graphic films, such as "Naked Blood". They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies, which were cleaned up a bit and turned into reality shows. Not recommended, but it will probably seduce those who see something once, and they will wonder why later, I know I did.
