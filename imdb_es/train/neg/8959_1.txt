Some people may consider this film as a work of art: to express your imagination in a movie to create a film full of antagonistic pain and death. Personally, I think this movie is disgusting, it should never have been released. . This film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time, it also makes you ill during the next few days. The terrible images that are shown in the film not only make it catch air, but they are fixed in your mind and it takes days to forget them. It is a pity that people waste their imagination in such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
