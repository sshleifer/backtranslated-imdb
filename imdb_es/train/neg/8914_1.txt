I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious viewers) twenty minutes because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I almost nearly cried for the $ 3.99 I had spent on Blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's performance and her tremendously borrowed Slavic accent are terrible enough to make one grit her teeth. I knew that two hours of it would be two hours too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unlikely actors of surprisingly few talents. While we are on the subject of talent, Breuer's supercilious seems to have been removed from a group of local actors. She clearly has not learned her trade. In fact, she is really horrible. All the public scenes seemed organized, with the extras walking mechanically on their best Sunday. Turning off this movie was much more satisfying than turning it on. Do not rent this terrible movie. You will regret having spent your money.
