This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've seen in my life. From the first scene, I knew it would be a great shock. Start with a seemingly bad girl killing a group of nuns on a mission. It turns out that the people who were inside him were possessed by some random zombies. Well, some years later, some college students are making some jokes. The horrible performance goes from the promise to the main athlete. Things like the athlete who shouted at him to do things in a way that was not chalonte, with the promise to react and do too many things "anxious to be popular." What really took the cake with this is the final battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with guns. For example, guns make a noise without mouth flash, and vice versa. This is accompanied by stop-motion zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery), cheesy music and about 40 weapons that come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is crap. Like many others, you can rent for 50 cents at the nearest low eyebrow movie rental location.
