This movie was absolutely frightening! I can not understand how this movie came into production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, this is all the fault of the writers team. You take the old average plot - we dance to get out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case. But this does not seem to resemble a true plot, or at least someone who cares. With Canadian actors speaking on what is supposed to be an American stage, this movie is not very flat. On a positive note, the direction was quite good and the cinematography was also quite decent. It seems that the production budget was also very generous. My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find the real screenwriters to help them bring the words to life in the film. Net result: how it moves is how it sucks.
