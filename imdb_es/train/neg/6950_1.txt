['We all knew that even before it aired, Ron Moore&#39;s miniseries is not Battlestar Galactica. It&#39;s okay. It simply means that you must support yourself. He can not rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it&#39;s good, it&#39;s good on its own merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, this is what Moore wanted. However, if your miniseries rots, it has embarrassed all the excellent actors who acted on screen, not to mention the large number of off-screen staff. And this is what he has done. <br /><br /> Yes, this miniseries is not a remake. I would not even call it a reimagination. It is a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It has no place in the galactic universe, with the same places, jargon and technology. It does not talk about the search for Galactica by the thirteenth tribe. Nor is it based on the legends and mysteries that sustained Galactica. The Ron Moore miniseries is an action movie from the space opera with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /><br /> Maybe I should say, &quot;just another&quot; space opera, action movie. Because, according to the arguments, his has little original, or even interesting. I could pass this on to you without a spoiler warning. But I will not inflict you that. I will only hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything in the story. <br /><br /> Yes, the creations of man turn against man and seek to destroy man. (I guess they forgot Azimov&#39;s rules, again). They look like humans, so it&#39;s the whole alien thing between us. At least there are no trips in time. Oh, and a lot of fight scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore pulled out of the Galactica, that ceremonial gesture became more corny than respectful. I mean, could not I even think of something of my own? <br /><br /> From the first minutes, I wanted to see something more. I did not care about any of Moore&#39;s characters, since I could not identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons started their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not care. What depress. <br /><br /> Moore&#39;s heroes face an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, instead of sticking their tail and saving their own butts. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe exit, instead of risking their own lives to defend others. At least the dislike is not apathy. <br /><br /> But in the end, the Ron Moore miniseries was just an activity without purpose, a movie on a treadmill, forever running and not going anywhere. And I just wanted it to end. And when it was over, my life force had been absorbed by me. Against my own will, I was becoming a soulless and mindless zombie, probably the kind that this miniseries would appeal to. I needed to recover. I needed, and I swear this is true. I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And happier.']
