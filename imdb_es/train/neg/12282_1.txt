This was one of the most boring "horror" movies I've ever seen. A university student has an epidemic of nightmares related to vagabond spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to offer a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard rate of vampires in the form of a music video of the 80s, this film is full of bad performances and an extremely slow story. Although, being such a bad and often laughable film (dig those mullets and the terrible dialogue), it would be a good material to simulate an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud mention of the film. being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award of the Academy of Sicily Fiction, Fanatasia and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil has a part in the film. It is a giant disaster, although with a small cult of followers (see the other IMDb comments for this movie).
