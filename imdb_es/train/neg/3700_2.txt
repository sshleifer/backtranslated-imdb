because that is the only way you will not think that this movie is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which at least was worth watching) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more of a vehicle to give Rock some time in the movie for a weak comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially since their jokes are supposed to be of the body of an old man, fat, rich and dead, but they show up coming from Rock. When you insult blacks and whites, chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, badly filmed, the performance is weak at best. Rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live video of Rock, you'll be far ahead of the game.
