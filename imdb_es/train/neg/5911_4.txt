POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The Spy Who Shagged Me is a highly overrated and exaggerated sequel. International Man of Mystery came out of nowhere. It was a lonely star that few people had ever heard of. But it was surprisingly original, it had a sophisticated and broad humor, it always maintained good taste and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more publicized and promoted commercially. <br /> <br /> Ok, I admit it, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was very funny, but only after seeing it twice. Or three times you see all the flaws. The performance was fine, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and was not as good as Liz Hurley in the first. Those characters that flourished in the first, (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown to the bottom to listen and do not have many independent scenes. The film is simply invaded by cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated the way they totally ignored some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed Vanessa at the beginning and they made Basil sit down, he knew that she was a fembot all the time. What was the point of that? They killed Number 2 in the first, and now they return it without any explanation. This is supposed to be a spy parody, I do not think any of the characters have a weapon in the movie. It simply goes down a path, further and further from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very unpleasant. All the Mini-Me joke `make fun of my size 'ages very quickly. Fat Bastard is just an unconvincing excuse for rude humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest are insipid or remnants of IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this were the first film in the series, then it would probably be easier. But the series began with a note of dry wit and then fell to a level of rude humor. So I say, just watch this movie if you have not seen your predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is a definite disappointment.
