SciFi has been having a lot of bad luck lately making quality films (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based on Beowulf's great epic, however, he deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that television commercials might well have called it "a shitty Christopher Lambert movie." I did not expect it to be as accurate as a Hollywood production, but nevertheless I hoped that "artistic integrity" would not interfere with the real story (even if it changed a bit to make a two-hour storyboard flow very well on the fringes). assigned times). <br /> <br /> Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (something was researched about it?). Obviously not, as could be said by the huge horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (with the exception of the mullet boy) are using. However, one of the main problems I had was with Grendel's appearance: if Beowulf is supposed to fight against him, should not he have measured sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? The segment of Grendel's death was also deficient in every way? in my opinion, that of the epic was actually better than the garbage invented in the script; For example: Is Grendel supposed to have his arm ripped off the socket by Beowulf? Do not cut off your forearm after it caught fire with an arrow that exploded from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother? Did they combine it with the dragon at the end of the epic where it finally dies when it succumbs to its wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because it is not related to the epic, since there really is not one (apart from the names of the characters). The only way I could recommend this movie is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann). although I do not recommend looking.
