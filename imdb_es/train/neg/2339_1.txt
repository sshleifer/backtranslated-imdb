This revolving movie is more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story and, as the movie progresses, you ask yourself: "What's going to happen?"; but nothing happens. The story about Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. Other people seem to have nothing in common: so, why put them together in a movie? With music you can see the worst movie. When I open the tap and water comes out with Bach's music, most people like to see it, but this is not a movie. The director must learn to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before beginning to direct a film.
