['Although I loved watching it and having fun with the total badness of a movie. I saw this movie through the useful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you turn to the other side of the DVD, they show the real movie, so I gave it a try. Seriously, folks, this is grilled cheese. <br /><br /> The acting, the special effects and the plot in general are very cheesy and unrealistic. &quot;Do not you need lungs?&quot; Crow said when he realized that his head could still speak while he had no body, and Tom Servo simply said sadly, &quot;No, he has neck juice!&quot; The ending is just classic and nobody can play this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the &quot;cat fight&quot; between the two strippers. That &quot;Miau&quot; after the fight or the scene, whatever it was, was classic. So, in a way, this was a fun movie. I think for terror fans, they probably enjoy it. For a good time, look at the MSTK3 version, you will get a great laugh. <br /><br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10']
