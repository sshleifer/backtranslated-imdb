Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time it is a movie that plays for many laughs. On a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, with her feet as one would expect, locked in cement. Rome immediately in the case after being hired by mountain man Waldo Gronsky. Rome is at immediate risk, since it has to investigate some types of mafias, who turn around the tables and discover that he is the main suspect, now must flee and hope to solve the case alone. The burly Sinatra strives to sell us the jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, not to mention sexually attractive to the cunning Raquel Welch, but fails miserably in this vanity project. The frankly laughable outcome that surrounds each woman is quite amazing, every woman in the movie is a shaky head, who likes to lean in front of the camera, Director Douglas, of course, forces him to zoom in the cracks of his ass every time he flexes his posterior muscles. There is even a ridiculously cheesy gay character who begs, this was a movie made by "real men" so that "real men" reaffirm their own sexuality, it is a shameful disaster.
