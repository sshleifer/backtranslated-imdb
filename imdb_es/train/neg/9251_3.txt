This movie is, despite its "independent" status, a stupid Hollywood version of a nauseating mother-daughter relationship. At first it was not so bad, but somewhere during the course of the film, at the time when the daughter goes out with that boy, I think, it becomes a film of union between mother and daughter. I'm sorry, but I do not know of any mother who has that kind of relationship with her daughter ... although it's probably better that way.
