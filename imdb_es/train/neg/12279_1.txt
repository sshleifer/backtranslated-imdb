Although this seems to be a pretty old program (2002), I saw my first episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst program. . . never. <br /> <br /> I am not one of those who make comments, but I was so surprised that there could be a program that tries to please unabashedly, and I only assume that it was their target audience, children under 12 years old. Elderly or people with an inferior IQ. <br /> <br /> The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disconnected story lines, I tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and at the same time trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics! <br /> <br /> Basic story they covered in the episode: Frat House hazing went awry with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be the son of the senators who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually a murder by peanut allergy. The senator believes that it could be his sworn enemy and his childhood best friend who did this because the senator was taking money for his votes for the legislation, but he finally got an awareness and said "no" meant mulit millionaire. Everyone is suspicious, but everyone has the usual alibi (former student girlfriend who fucks a married teacher, so he had to lie, the disgruntled student who was informed by the victim actually had a life-changing experience, the enemy senators did not pay a desperate student to kill the sworn enemy son, he freely gives money to many broken students). All the time, the heroine of this trickle has her niece who is "at that age" and is attracted to a child, with whom she finally gets the courage to talk with the help of her aunt, but only to get rid of he because 'in' girls says that he is not good enough and that to continue with her she abandons him. Do not worry, she comes back with the boy after he learns the truth about life and the girls 'in' abandon her. Aunt also explains that God is the only one she can trust (she was almost sick right now) <br /> <br /> This 'drama' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team discover who the killer is. . . You will laugh at this, sure yes. . . <br /> <br /> He is one of the Frat boys who just a year ago discovered that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and is trying to impress a real father by killing a child and placing a bomb on him. the funeral. . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, the action is cardboard, the continuity is cardboard, the story is cardboard Anyone who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain <br /> <br /> Why the writers of this The programs have tried to include EVERY eventuality in the only program, which means that obviously they do not have faith in the development of the character or in the ability of the actors to carry out a simple plot. Watching this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a selection of teeth, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, I never thought there would be a day when I would say that!) < Br /> <br /> In the words of the beloved Simpsons comic book character: "comic book guy". . . . <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. . . . . FOREVER.
