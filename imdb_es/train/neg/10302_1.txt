Since the "Rugrats" fell from the category of good and funny cartoon series at a mediocre and absolutely horrible rate for two year olds in the last three or four years, obviously, the tyrants of Klasky-Csupo should not have ideas . After numbing all the characters, add even the stupidest, replace some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, she is not Chucky Finster!) And has no sense of continuity (eg: in an episode of Kimi, I saw the Every day, Tommy and Chucky got a new puppy, but in the next episode, the dogs mentioned never appear), one would think that the creators could kill the show out of mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> Everything I will say about this special is that it stinks! While they are not as horrible as Kimi's episodes, they are all even more stupid than them, including Grandpa (my God, he used to be the best character in the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is unnecessarily fluffy, and the only difference between this and other new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Wow, what fun! <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this show before it gets worse.
