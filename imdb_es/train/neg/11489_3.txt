In the United States, there have been very few films about Rome that were not shot in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly after. The Hollywood sword and the epics of the sandals mostly have a Christian theme, which hinders access to the previous Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and found some resistance in Hollywood because he did not have Jesus in her). /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one image that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is established when Rome was just one city among many in the Italian peninsula, and had just expel the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and although the values ​​of production are not minimal, the performances and the characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with the dubbing of wood in English it is very cheesy. At the beginning I had some good laughs. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre, having lost most of the films of Hercules of the sixties. It's fun to a certain extent, but as the movie progresses, it becomes somewhat boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure: if I had seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. that. At that age, I went for anything with Romans and sword fights in it. So at least, this movie brought some childhood memories.
