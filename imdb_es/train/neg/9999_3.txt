This is the kind of movie that my enemies content that I see all the time, but it is not so true. I only see it from time to time to make sure it's as bad as I thought at first. <br /> <br /> Some kind of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747. (That, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing hijacked a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into the Bermuda triangle and sinks low pressure, a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> He has one of those star releases. , the stars falling or just above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!" says pilot Jack Lemon. He is so correct. Except for George Kennedy. He is in all these disaster movies. <br /> <br /> Instead, watch another movie. Oh, no "Airport" the original. That is not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about clogged airplanes like "Flight of the Phoenix."
