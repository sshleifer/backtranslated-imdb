This was the first sequel I saw (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought that before seeing it it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was basically the first script with some additional characters and the situation changed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not satisfied with life on earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has hidden the past from her daughter because she wants to protect her, and when Melody discovers that she is upset and angry. And then he decides to run away, and becomes a mermaid. So she is happy swimming and Ariel intends to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not sound so badly written, but the clich√©s and repetitions of the situations in the first movie are simply very obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, in general, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There is also a full load of other new characters, Tip and Dash, which are two of them. They are not as bad as characters in themselves, just try not to think about Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just do not have the same magical energy as the original songs. Obviously, the animation did not have much work, in parts it is nervous and not much imagination is used for the movements of the characters. <br /> <br /> Another tip: try to forget it. The original character of Ariel while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious and curious teenager has become a bored and bored mother and wife, and her characteristic red hair is tied. This looks much better if you have never seen the original; You will not have anything to compare it with. <br /> <br /> However, in general, it could have been worse, it is not as bad as the truth. Other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But it is for your collection, if not more, but if Disney continues like this, they will lose all their biggest fans.
