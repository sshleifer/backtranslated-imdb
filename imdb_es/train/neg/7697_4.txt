This miniseries is actually more entertaining than others with much bigger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (almost 3 hours) I think the children would like it a little. It has adventure, action, "suspense scenes", and not too much romance or other "spooky" things. When you're young, you're not too critical of the flexing of the rubber swords, the countryside action and the scenes that repeat themselves. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, as was done in the old series for the audience to catch up). Finally, children generally accept more the dialogue of American English that comes out of the mouth of the Asian. actors (Not to mention the fact that several of the main roles are played by non-Asian actors). <br /> <br /> I was going to give this film three stars, but I felt like the director, the producers and the cast. He deserved extra credit for at least carrying out the project. This movie is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort and discipline to do it. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not a recommended use for your time, but you can follow the children entertained while traveling in the mini-van. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell checker seems to think that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While the "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and the OED consider it an alternative way.
