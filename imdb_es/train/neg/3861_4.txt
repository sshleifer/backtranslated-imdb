I'm not a big fan of rom / coms at best. Some have been pretty good (Sleep check for an insomnia), but this is just more of the same but less. <br /> <br /> With a career time of 100 minutes, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. . The only real laugh is when strange men and friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I'm sure there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that you deserve $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (and just because I'm a big fan of Lee)
