I have no idea why they did this version of "Persuasion" when they already had that good miniseries with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I guess they wanted to make a full-length version, but, of course, you had to eliminate many things; Unfortunately, what ended up on the floor of the cutting room was all the ingenuity and the charming humor, leaving a film that was mere melodrama instead of a funny exhibition of English customs and customs. <br /> <br /> Also, the characters were superficial and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing Captain Wentworth as a modern, dumb teenager (and if you're a modern, dumb teenager reading this, let me tell you: running after a man like a woman in heat is not good). That's something a well-educated woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this sensible heroine. <br /> <br /> Some have said that they found this ridiculous laugh; My reaction was not laughter, but indignation. The very idea of ​​such corruption of a work by Austen is below contempt. <br /> <br /> It was scary.
