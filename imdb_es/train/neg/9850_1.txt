I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I've bought. (in my ignorance I thought that this was the Peter Jackson movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and they look terrible. The script promotes that type of film for television, contemplates the type of medium-distance performance. The cast seems to have been taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, have a look at each one and stick to it. Also, I had never been confused with a movie until I sat down to watch this. It is a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration appears in a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.
