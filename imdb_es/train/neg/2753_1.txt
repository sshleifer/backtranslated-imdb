First of all, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is not seen anywhere in this movie. What is a movie without Sam Niel? Did anyone see Event Horizon? D-Wars potentially had a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers, but it sounds great, but unfortunately not. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking the $ 5 more or less that it costs to rent D-Wars and add 10 to those five and buy a Sam Niel movie. Apparently, to send this I have to have ten lines of text, so here is a list of Sam Niel movies that I recommend. <br /> <br /> -jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red october -evento horizon -no jurassic park three <br /> <br /> D-Wars in general is a stack
