A very weak film, mainly due to a bad story, but also a bad performance in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and an irrational behavior by many of the characters. If you are someone who likes to disconnect and simply watch a movie for its creativity or performance criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally I can not do that with a drama and I found it too far-fetched. <br /> <br /> I am particularly upset when a main character, who is supposed to be an intelligent person, acts continuously as a complete imbecile. In this film, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no film. <br /> <br /> The first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and runs into a girl, Mallory Doss, played by Embeth Davidtz, who shouts that his car was stolen. They are standing in the middle of a tropical storm while he harasses her to accept that they take her home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about her strange father who belongs to some kind of strange sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at their ruined hut in the poorest part of the city, they notice that their car is in the driveway. Also the lights of the house are on and some objects in the house have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, she's weird (she looks like a bum, she gets naked in front of him until she's completely naked, right?) yes!). Besides, the father is strange, the house is in ruins, everything should have told Magruder: "Hey, this is too weird for me, I'm gone!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by his story and his sex, takes the case of trying to get his father to commit himself. All the screams are prepared! <br /> <br /> Then, being the best As the flight lawyer he is, he arrives late at the office with the same shirt he had the night before (a fact that all women in the office notify). Is it likely that a successful lawyer acts as a lawyer? Magruder has annoyed the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that the father is terrifying them, the police ignore him. I could have reluctantly believed an assistance. But no help. Not at all, it's not likely! <br /> <br /> It's too unlikely.
