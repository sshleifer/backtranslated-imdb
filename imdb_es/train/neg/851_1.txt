After finishing the book the same day I saw the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the film, due to the qualification. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was good trying to be a movie. I have a couple of main points to not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS *********** <br /> <br /> 1. The casting Jack Nicholson hardly fits the character of Jack Torrence. In addition, NEVER would have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy in a very different way. I can see why they chose Jack Nicholson, however, the smile, the pointed eyebrows, but he is not supposed to look really "evil". It is supposed to look normal, and it becomes evil. In addition, they make one of the worst pairs of movies. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He acted to get drunk. <br /> <br /> 2. The script. They cut so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I expected in the movie were deleted, changed or handled incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book that I expected to see (the hedges, the rocker deck, the elevator) were not in the film, and it was 2 and a half hours! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack died frozen, Wendy was never injured ... The Overlook did not explode. The ending was so great in the book, and the movie ruined it so horribly that I was horrified. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, unless Jack used a rock mallet. You never saw a rock deck during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I did not like about the movie, but there are things that were good. The angels in the chamber were great, the blood coming out of the elevator (it did not happen in the book) was great, but maybe I was too irritated because the movie was not going with the book, to try to scare me. I recommend reading the book, before watching this movie. I applaud Stephen King for agreeing to sign a contract not to dismiss Stanley Kubrik again. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights that I could shout all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least it has the hedges. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
