Music that polishes the nerves like nails on a blackboard, acting so zombie that it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie; throwing everyone in it like real zombies --- with the cast of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as heroes ... a film so outrageously dreadful that if there still were "drug addicts" it could be considered a cult movie --- but, oh so amateur, the scripts could have been taken by the actors, their lines read as they moved slowly through the movie --- banal, illogical games, inspired by the subdivisions of Los Angeles, accessories directly from ToysRus! Was a movie made that is so completely inept? Logic flies to the wind in this arduous, meaningless, meaningless and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that he could not catch a turtle in a refrigerator: low cut, long legs, and amazon! He kept my attention until the end; the way a terrible and continuous chain accident in the fog that involves several vehicles keeps us vigilant until the end ... then, after a ridiculous lightning fight in a prison on another planet, a sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter and unbalanced mentally chases a delayed alien fugitive --- TO THE EARTH! Do not let anyone appear in your popcorn, you could enjoy watching this one. It is so bad!
