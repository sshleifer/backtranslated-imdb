As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can stand ANY film that can be presented to me, but there is absolutely no reason for this. <br /> <br /> Rated as "Super Action" in the Video section of Blockbuster and given the dreaded "Restricted Display Sticker" I guess these are the only methods that the filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from a confident person. <br /> <br /> Ashamed of you Robert Napton! Too bad you exploited these poor Mexican actors who probably promised you hope to succeed in American cinema. You are a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that contains the slightest action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like the 6 of them. And is not he an Asian boy in the background? Why is it always during the day? Why did I take half of the movie to show something ... and, more importantly, why did we see the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
