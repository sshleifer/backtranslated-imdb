In 15 minutes, my whole family was looking forward to Goldie Hawn's character dying, or at least to the character of Steve Martin leaving her. At 40 minutes, we turn it off. There are only a couple of movies a year that we try to be so annoying that we can not stand long enough for the story to set. <br /> <br /> Normally, I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember that I enjoyed the original by Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "Whats The Worst That Can Happen" and the writer of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I think this is what we end up with.
