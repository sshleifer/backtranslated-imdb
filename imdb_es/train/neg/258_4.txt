This is the first time I've seen a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be the last. I could not see why it was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face at the camera, or to say "I'm going to take a shower". <br /> <br /> The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good boy has a woman, then the bad boy uses it. In the middle, officials ruining. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. Do you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a boy, but you do not do your work at home to solve a trivial conundrum? <br /> <br /> There is not a great performance, there is not much plot or story, and the filming is done MTV style. Do not waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
