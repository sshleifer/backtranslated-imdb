When I saw "Kroko" I would have liked to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: main characters flat: absolutely no development, for example. Kroko, the German metaphorical child with problems, remains a pure metaphor without any capacity for positive participation despite several possibilities to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolutionary plot. I guess the movie tried an environmental survey but it did not succeed: the camera seemed shaky instead of motivated. The images were low contrast, gray and dark; I'm sure, but the components did not provide a convincing impression of the social environment. However, the story had some potential, it could have been a good short story.
