After a long period in space, looking for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who got married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plans an evil plan, using crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new land and submerge the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful Superman movies with the unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in Bryan Singer's version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in IMDb. Also, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something embarrassingly ridiculous. Actress Kate Bosworth, twenty-two years old, has been wrong in a bad way, playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five-year-old child. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville." The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. Last but not least, and despite being an excellent Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, therefore, older and older than the rest of the main cast. The corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and it is terrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
