Wow ... What would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; can a) crush and throw it down the toilet or b) make a movie based on Whoopi Goldberg's premise as a hard-nut futuristic policeman associated with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms like "I did not play the trumpet" and blows raspberries on the base that this is fun. That's right, I would choose the option that has more merit: download the toilet. <br /> <br /> This must be seen to be believed. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit into the category "so bad, it's good". In fact, I have it on television as I write, and while I watched it I felt the need to appear in IMDb and register my displeasure. <br /> <br /> Considering that Jurassic Park was made a couple of years before, how did he do it? Do you think audiences would tolerate a man wearing a rubber suit? WG should have just walked and cursed the consequences. Everyone involved will go to hell for this criminal loss of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing, I am about to implode.
