This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material, the army life is always good to laugh, and the stars, this movie should have been a great laugh. It was worth a couple of giggles, at best. Steve Martin has been much more fun than this and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should hold dramatic roles, where he could follow the example of Robin Williams and someday win an Oscar.
