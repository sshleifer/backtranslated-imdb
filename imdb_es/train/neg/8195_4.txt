Every Christmas Eve, I have my children support another sample of It's A Wonderful Life. I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. Then demmite me. I admit it. I like cheesy movies, schmaltzy. I like excellent ones, smart ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual k-ching ka-ching kinematic of Santa in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not make anyone forget about Bedford Falls, but I do not think a Christmas movie should reach an iconic stature to be successful. "Fred" is a perfectly acceptable Christmas movie, with enough humor for adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first class Santa Claus, which helped a lot. It's not a great movie, and it's unlikely to become a must-see for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, a holiday with a little bit of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
