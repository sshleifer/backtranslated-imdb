It is not a 'women's movie' but a movie for the gang. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director about women. Principal Andy McKay simply does not know the woman. Peaks of bad taste, humorous American Pie style, raw history, meaningless, unfounded story, refuted characters. The vulgar fantasies came to life on the screen. Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses agreed to participate in it.
