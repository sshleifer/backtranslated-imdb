I know that slashers are always supposed to be bad, but come on, what the hell is this? It's like a group of 10-year-olds who saved their lunch money and started filming this at the end of the week. <br /> <Anyway, six young people go to the same house to die on the screen. We have the smart one, the whore, the other whore, the black man, the murderer, stereotypes like that. After one is devoured by a One man wearing a mask that rejected the people in the poor box rejected the others. Everyone is being harassed by the boat. There is a pretty decent murder in the middle, but then you get bored even more, and especially to more false alarms. Seriously, we actually know that he can not be the killer when a person is attacked because the guy loves to take his sweet moment for everything. <br /> <br /> After every character dies you expected to die, the ugly standard blonde girl. and his soon-to-be-boyfriend is finally captured by the murderer (they get like, pushed down and then faints) and the murderer reveals himself. I think the writers of this movie just took a bandage and a pen and they put it somewhere in the list of characters. The reason is simply silly and I do not even mean the damn secret. The murderer, of course, yields. too much time to explain everything (and then an additional ten minutes in which the arm is cut for some reason) and, finally, is dominated by a guy with a gun. Hey, it's not fair! <br /> <br /> Really One of the most horrible movies I've seen. I could have more fun watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear. Most likely, most of the 80s fans also sucked, but at least they released some T & A. It has nothing in its favor.
