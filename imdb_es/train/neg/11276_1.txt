I will not waste my time writing anything else about how every aspect of this movie is indescribably bad. That has already been done in great detail, many times. The 'plot' began as a boredom of cockney wide-boy / gangster by cockney very uninspiring and very quickly descended into complete chaos. Anyone who pretends that he can see some masterpiece hidden within this terrible disaster is only fooling himself. It's been 7 or 8 years since I saw him during his 1-week film career before he retired, however, it comes to mind for being the most terrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making these comments, and in fact the only reason I went to see the movie, is because of the fun fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second "heavy" on the Pub scene. It was his hands that pushed a zippo lighter into the face of Rhys Ifan at the bar in 'Russia' (it was actually filmed at the old Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no experience in acting, he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part. After having seen the movie, it seemed that no one in it required any acting experience. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in all the cinema, and this was only a couple of days after it was released. . I've never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and that it disappeared so quickly, and rightly so. In case you were thinking about renting this movie on a DVD, I would advise you to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot and then put them in the eye sockets. This will probably be much less painful than watching the movie.
