After we counted the use of the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, we heard some really bad actors talking about a woman and a horse, and almost acting like 12-year-old children. Being naughty together, well, we turned it off. Trusting blasphemy and petty humor is a sure sign of a lost Hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and untalented writers. <br /> <br /> We gave it a second chance, thinking that it would surely improve. Not given. Later, my boyfriend skipped the rest of the movie in case he has improved, there are still no dice. <br /> <br /> The main character had a great bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it. This is for anyone, except for really immature teenagers, or fraternity boys.
