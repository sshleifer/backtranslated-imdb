What a pity that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this gut. That does not rule it out however; gather a group of boys and some Stellas and have a good time running this time again and again and rolling on the floor with tears of laughter. Great things wasted at night. Al Hunter focuses on a well-publicized theme from the late 1980s, that the hooligans were well organized and not really interested in soccer itself, often with respectable jobs (real estate agents). But how can Clarke convince us that any of the two-bit actors that deviate from other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or that soon turn into a bad quality drama (Eastenders) can make us believe that they are a hard football? The thugs are ridiculous. Should we really believe that the ICF (in which, of course, the drama is based) would NEVER go to another city to fight only with SIX types? <br /> <br /> The ICF would move the metro stations and others. HUNDREDS. Scally by Andy Nicholls needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The acting is atrocious and provides the most laughs. Oldman is so amazing that he is amazing. Most of them look like they should be in a Mr. Matey bathroom bubble. A true inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera that thinks they can flick-go for it.
