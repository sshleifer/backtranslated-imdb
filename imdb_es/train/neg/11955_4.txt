"Visitor Q" is a failed attempt at a black comedy that focuses on what could be the most dysfunctional family in the world, including physical abuse, beatings, murder, incest, sodomy, necrophilia, and the nursing mother who cares for her husband and her adult daughter, etc. The film is so scandalous that it got some critical acclaim and established a small cult following. However, with the quality of the home video and a slapdash production, "Visitor Q" simply does not hold up as a curiosity. The genitals are blurred and the sanitary devices are clearly visible, the makeup is horrible and everything else is, at best, amateur. A waste of time. (DO-)
