Stupid and simply strange movie about a child who is traumatized when he discovers that Santa is not real (???). Grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice. One Christmas, he snaps and prepares to kill the naughty people, dressed as Santa Claus, of course. <br /> <br /> Bored and simply bad movie of Santa assassin. If you're looking for gore, it's not here. Only some of the murders are shown and they are not so bloody with VERY false effects. Most of the movie only contains Brandon Maggart talking alone and slowly going crazy. The script is trite, the performance is terrible and leads to an end that left me gawking at the television. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I was not hallucinating. Final really VERY poor. <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas movie, rent "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70s, NOT the terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
