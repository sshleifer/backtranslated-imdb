Horror / science fiction that is interesting because it is laughable. F / X pretty good ... for what you manage to see. A thriller made for television that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but mistaken scientist who manipulates stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrific results give birth to a hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to see the new and brilliant experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering in amazement ... The creation of Coombs, by the way, is his own son fused with a hammer, he lets go to hunt one by one to his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
