!!!!! ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I would say that the only way to do this is to say, ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿In fact, I would say that the only way to treat a film like this, in which a remarkable man is opposed to the gullible public, is to treat it as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough commits something resembling a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely serious movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma necessary for the role of the title and the romantic secondary plot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau) lacks any kind of screen chemistry. But to be fair to the cast, they were not helped with the script that fails to play Archie as the brazen man who is fooling everyone into believing he is a Native American. The producers and screenwriters have made the big mistake of having the film focused on the plot that Archie is an Englishman. That's why I wrote "Possible Spoiler", it is not revealed until the end of the movie that the title character is English, but it is obvious that everyone who saw this movie knew that in advance, therefore, there is no surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is charming and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major ecologist of the 20th century if the truth is told. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly THE TWO TORRES, if you want to classify it as a green message), there has not been a great ecological film. In fact, most environmentally concerned movies suck and that includes GRAY OWL, a film that, as expected, had a serious problem finding a distributor.
