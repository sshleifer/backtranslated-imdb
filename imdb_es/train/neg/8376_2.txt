"Little Man", now on DVD, is a failure of Wayans Brothers. It is the story of a criminal smaller than a dwarf played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a robbery. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, elaborate the genius plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant it in the lady's house. Then he goes through all kinds of "Alone at home" or "Children's game" like the chaos to recover the jewel and be treated like a baby. I was surprised at how low the mood was in this movie. The jokes have been made elsewhere so many times, they are not cute or fun. I almost think that the movie could have been more fun if they did not use CGI and they used the little actor that Marlon's face got stuck on. When seeing the deleted scenes (less CGI), this actor was fun as a Mini-me, but they chose a different route. Some cameos and Tracy Morgan do some funny scenes ... Spend your rental fee $ in Borat if you really want to laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
