I would have given this movie 1 out of 10 if it were not for more. The performance of Claudine Barretto. and I will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino is here. and end. <br /> <br /> I REALLY EVITO watch Pinoy horror movies because the stories lack originality and I really believe that (some) writers do not pay enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant?) . It was as if they "pushed" the film forward when its narrative stank. and my kindness, the creative exhaustion led them to cheat other films. why?? Why did this movie get a good review? I would not give much merit. The movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more strange because it's about Filipino folklore ... it goes on my list of the "most likely to happen" category. I just wanted them to spend more time improving the story lines and correcting those flash back sequences, no matter if the lighting sucked, it would not matter much if the content would blow you away ... SAYANG.
