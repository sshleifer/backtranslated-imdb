This story about three women is a very sensitive study on: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is around 37 years old and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the eldest who is the mother of Muriël . They live together in the same building. They have different life expectations. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a town and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a child. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so expect something, for example an accident, that could dramatize this story. As the times pass, you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing else. This movie is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.
