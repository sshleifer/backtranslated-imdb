This was a horrible movie! I gave him 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and one for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... Apart from that, the story just sucked and the cars that ran through the cities were not so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably what Lo What bothered me most, I rarely saw something like that built.
