The documentary entitled Quick, cheap and out of control is a very interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved with their work, showing great love and enjoyment for their own work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, should be the topics on which these people worked / studied. . They were interesting for about five minutes, then they became boring and lasted too long. <br /> <br /> However, the video was filmed in a very creative way. I really enjoyed the movie of one thing with one voice copy over another. It played excellent and also coincided very well with the music.
