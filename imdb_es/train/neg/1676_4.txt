Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three actors very committed giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for its endowments, a drug addict and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make films for adults, simply does not have an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the events that led to and the consequences of a brutal mass murder that occurred in the late 1980s in Los Angelos, to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and that finally He was acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the fault factor, regardless of the result, varied quite high in the "He did it" zone. <br /> <br /> There's no one to sympathize with in this movie, like everyone else. He's a selfish criminal. There is simply nothing remotely interesting here.
