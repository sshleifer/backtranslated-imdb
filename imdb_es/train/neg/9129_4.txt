There is no way to avoid it, this movie is terrible. I've seen the old movies of Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I'm familiar with the characters and their origins in series, but it's still just great. However, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines with his interpretation of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy and strength simmering through a Stoic fa√ßade; is a performance that I put on par with Peter Cushing's interpretation of Van Helsing, but made in a tenth of the accumulated screen time of all the films of "Dracula" of Cushing. If the film was made in a more serious and comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP through the AVENGERS television show of the 1960s, this could have been something special. If you are a complete of Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something you should see, but it is a pass for any other person.
