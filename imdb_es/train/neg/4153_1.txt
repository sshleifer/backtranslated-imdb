I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the performance was terrible and if there was a plot in all this, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember that an EAST movie is bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and piqueros! ;) Even that could not prevent this movie was a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lie down in this case) in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with the general effect "zombie". Since apparently in this movie, zombies are so common that running over a couple here and there, and talking about it casually in a service station (one with an internal repair windshield but no indoor bathroom), the genre of films Zombies is not even a factor until the end. Even then, a cameo of a dozen zombies tearing off a girl's clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> To the vampires: apparently, all zombies are men and all vampires are women, which is fine by me. I'm not sure how vampires are coming out in daylight, or why / how a soldier vampire came to stand in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake in his heart, waiting for the Queen of the vampires to leaf through it all the time. The last segment in the old convent did not make sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire "Do you think we did the right thing?" By killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that of putting it above. <br /> <br /> The acting and special effects were also at their lowest point. You could almost see the hoses from which the fake blood was pumped during the first plane of the zombie that was run over by the General. Speaking of the general, where did you find these Kenny Rogers in a similar way? I have no idea what the General was, apart from generally confusing and out of place. <br /> <br /> In general, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong need to lose $ 3. Just my $ 0.02.
