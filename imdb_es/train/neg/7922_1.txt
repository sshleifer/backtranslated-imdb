In a distant galaxy there is a planet called Ceta. It is native people to love cats. But the people of the dog wage war on these people who love the cats and have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people to eat. This is one of the most wonderful ideas for a movie I've seen. Let Ted Mikels make a film more incompetent than the standard already low that established in previous films. It's like I enjoy playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can it go? The only losers on stage are the United States the spectator. Mr. Mikels and his silly handlebar mustache have people who STILL keep buying this shit. <br /> <br /> My degree: F <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Comment by Ted Mikels; The story behind the completion of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds of behind-the-scenes images; Filmography of Ted Mikels; and trailers for "The Worm Eaters" "Girl in Gold Boots", "Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (nudity), "Blood Orgy of the She Devils", and "the Corpse Grinders"
