I read in the newspapers that W.Snipes was bankrupt, so it does not surprise me that he participates in low budget projects like The Contractor. It's just the next action star to join a growing club: the moneyless action stars of the '90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he is the protagonist of a cheap action movie that was filmed in Bulgaria (we are supposed to believe that the location is London, as only a complete imbecile would buy that). The story is that of another 1000 movies: good forces good retreats The man is again hired by the government to do a wet job. After the government wants to get rid of him, the good guy escapes after killing the bad guys (was that a spoiler? I guess not!) The star of the movie: the girl (Eliza Bennett) beats everyone else of the cast. A star is for her, plus a star for the eyes candy Lena Headey, 2 stars ago. Only for fans of Snipes! All others: avoid!
