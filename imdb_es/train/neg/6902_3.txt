In spite of the favorable comments that this film has obtained in New Zealand, any exaggeration that surrounds the production is unfortunately not deserved. In addition to a plot of only clichés, the film is disappointed by its weak performance, accents and lack of tension in general. <br /> <br /> Although it has the general look of a big budget (for New Zealand), the feeling is decidedly a small Kiwi town ... <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen The Brothers ? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who do will choose the similarities immediately ... I have heard comments that scenes like children playing basketball, etc. they were filmed to make fun of the cliché "guys talking" shit ", but it seems forced ... <br /> <br /> I think Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but once again, his delivery always seems merely timid. <br /> <br /> Those who have some doubt that the culture of the Samoans living in New Zealand has been affected in a deep and hopeful way by the discourse, the American culture and everything that is find among them will be decided at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> Robbie magasiva always looks good on the screen, but is disappointed by the script ... <br /> <br /> He always rubs me off incorrect way when a "comedy" has scenes that are configured in such an obvious way, you feel like having a good moan in the punchline cliché: look how you want to be a white boy ... <br /> <br / > I know someone who found this movement However, that person has the brain of a tadpole, and I would struggle to spell his name if he were offered a million dollars ... <br /> <br /> That sums up a bit the mentality of this movie, it's fine, but it's not great, it's fun but it's not funny ..... Wake up New Zealand - this is NOT a 5 star movie despite everything that shines (white middle class fault? :-)) opinions .... <br /> <br /> My advice? If you see it, get drunk first !!!
