Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The editing is the worst of all, the sound effects were terrible and the sound editing was hit. Most of the film, all that can be done here are the effects of kicking, with the confusing noise that is heard in the background. I had to turn my volume to full volume for her, what was going on ... and what was I supposed to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can not believe that people really put some green for this movie. It makes me think that I could take a piece of shit in a box, send it to the producers and then have them fund me a movie. <br /> <br /> Dolph, it was something usual, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad and the movie stunk. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, directing or editing a movie, look at this!
