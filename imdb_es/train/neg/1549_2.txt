While Leon is cute in SNL, he is only on for a minute. Like most SNL movie scenes, it can not fill 90 minutes. It has some nice moments (the ones you've seen in the trailer) but the actors are wasted to a large extent. Tim Meadows does the best he can, but the plot simply does not have many high points. Will Farrell has a small part. Farrell may be the funniest man in the world ... but not in this movie. What a pity.
