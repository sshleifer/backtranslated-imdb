To begin with, I must point out the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why or why. When you finally discover things, you simply realize that it is nothing more than a twisted opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate children ... The characters are quite poor and the actors (especially the young ones) do not help. A lot to make them look believable. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is an excellent actress, it does not matter if the film is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing that can be said about "Cold Winter Sun" is that the debutante Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he has filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
