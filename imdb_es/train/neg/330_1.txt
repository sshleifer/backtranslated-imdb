I wanted to hit the television. Seeing it was torture. I hated it. Never look at this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. Normally I like him, but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating movie in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is odious. The only remotely fun part is the rocking chair with the black teeth that get all the girls. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE SOMEONE. If you even like Adam Sandler a bit, do not buy it. It will only make you hate it. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. It's a waste of the $ 1.99 I paid for it.
