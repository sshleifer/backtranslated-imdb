This is really an insult for the victims and their families of the killer BTK. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a film of real events does not make any sense, since real events are more interesting than this invented farce. Do not even waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful description of events that should not be a joke, which is really what this movie did. If I was allowed to give a -10 to this movie, I would. The performance was horrible and it seems that it was filmed in an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
