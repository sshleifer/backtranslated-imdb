Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm starving for good TV and I applaud TNT for providing these "opportunities." But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I suppose when it comes to the film Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing is, the irony is that it just does not translate well on the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), King's experience can not be filmed with the same impact as stories when read. Many people would not agree with this, but I am sure that in the bottom of their hearts they have to admit that the best story of King filmed is nothing more than a pale memory of the person they read. The reason is simple. King's average story takes place in the mental scene of the characters in the story. He gives us glimpses of his inner thoughts, his emotions and his views sometimes fractured or unreal. In short, King takes the reader to places where he can not place a Panavision camera. As an audience that watches the King filmed, we have less than half of the information that the reader has access to. It is not too difficult to say that One becomes a character in a King story that he read, while One limits himself to the little voyeurism of that same character when it is filmed. As King writes, Hollywood will try to film everything that comes out of its word processor, regardless of whether they should do it or not. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and prudence to carry out the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is similar to turning lead into gold, or some arcane Zen domain. Oh well, better luck next time.
