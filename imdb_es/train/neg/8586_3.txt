What a disappointment ... we must admit that it is the best prequel, but the story is weak, the plot is hasty and the final result is just a collection of pieces, poorly made and crossed out as amateurs. There are numerous continuity errors that flagrantly collide with the original films, and the appearance of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now a cheesy nonsense that will be ridiculed for many years. I will not complain about the abysmal dialogue, since it is about Star Wars ... the three original films had style, feelings of worship and funny stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were superficial attempts to earn more money, and this lack of love is amply demonstrated. Absolutely disappointing.
