The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a parody of "Airplane!" (Two years before the fact: good). of what happens when the vegetables, or in this case the fruits, attack. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of magic film (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse shooting, people looking at tomatoes off the screen, people throwing tomatoes the size of a ball of basketball to the actors on screen), tomatoes attack everyone in their leafy grip. <br /> <br /> Then, it depends on Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies who do not want any government to save the day. Of course, there is a meddling reporter (Taylor) who appears in the worst moments, dancing and singing Army soldiers, Japanese scientists with voices bent, some guy dragging a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, the San Diego Chicken before it became big. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not so good. In fact, it is likely that you can recover better after seeing this. Part of the dialogue is indisputably bad ("Please, pass the tomato sauce", it is not something to say in front of the tomatoes) and in what refers to the "Love of puberty" ... well, I can not blame the tomatoes to shrink. Listening to him <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I liked the main song and the initial credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at the same time that it was pretty well executed. ... that is all. <br /> <br /> Three stars. It is not a "Murder" comedy, but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
