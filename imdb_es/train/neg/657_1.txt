PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> storyline: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who is a little in love with her. Now, she is preparing for her prom with her stupid and annoying friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one because the killer escaped from prison and nobody bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> pros: I got some good laughs from the movie because of the terrible dialogue and the silly character that moves. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely obsessed with her (does not seem so great) has escaped from prison. Her reason: they do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> cons: Let me start by saying that I'm a big slasher fan. I can usually have fun even with the bad guys. I even like some horror movies PG-13. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally qualified as PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So, the fact that this is a silly slasher movie that is rated PG-13 has nothing to do with me not enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movies that do not even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. It is a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills his entire family. A few years later, he tries to compensate by ruining his prom and killing all his friends ... Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone would care about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, has cramps and I do not care. This should have been a lifetime feature, not a new version of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a slasher movie with terrible death scenes. I do not even care that it is not so bloody, some of my favorite killers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not so bloody, but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters who die in the same hotel room off the screen, a woman who is stabbed several times without stabbing, and a foreground in the face of a bad actor while screaming in agony. I'm sure the 10-year-old girls were terrified, but I was not. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. There was Donna's boyfriend, unreal sensitive, Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee that you'll never meet such a sensitive boyfriend in your life, unless you're a gay man. Then we had the annoying friends of Donna, Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the DEATH PROOF characters were annoying, try to watch this movie. And I do not mean Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's SHE TO ALL THAT performance. <br /> <br /> Add to all the predictable plot twists, a terrible soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have quite a bad smell.
