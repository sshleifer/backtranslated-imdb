I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos' work and the photo in MacDonald's TCM Magazine with her angel costume looked great (awesome wings), so I thought about watching this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived notion about it. I thought he had a nice start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary who does not know he exists. The scene in which she appears in the costume party with her simple angel costume with an uncooperative halo and wings that do not stay is truly captivating. I was even with the movie when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a true angel. But after a while, it began to fall apart. Eddy is "asleep" for the rest of the movie, so everything is a dream. Whatever happens from then on does not matter, because he is only dreaming. The rest was a less plot and meaningless. I had to force myself to continue with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some crazy hallucination was simply strange. <br /> <br /> Eddy "woke up" a little earlier and the original story continued, or if he had really married an angel, I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of his true character. <br /> <br /> There really were not enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald interprets was like nails on a blackboard. Completely wrong for his operatic voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing what the real stars were.
