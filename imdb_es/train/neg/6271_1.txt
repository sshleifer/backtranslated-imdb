There are no words to explain how bad the WEEKEND OF THE NIGHT is. It simply challenges the description. Something about a computer that can turn personal objects into silver balls that enter the victim's mouth, that kills them or turns them into zombies. Everything is so strange that it is impressive. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I am not inventing these things. The computer also controls things like cars, although there is nothing that links the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is total garbage. Bad surreal garbage. Spectacularly, bad trash unique in its kind. There are many sex scenes thrown here and there, which are not very hot or erotic. There is even a scene in which a woman apparently makes love or wants to kiss a tarantula in French, which made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there, with the equally unfortunate video straight to the house BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it is fun to watch and try to make sense of what is happening.
