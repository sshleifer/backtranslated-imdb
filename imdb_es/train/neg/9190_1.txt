This is by far the worst movie I've seen. I've seen some pretty horrible movies in my time, but this one takes the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I create a word to describe how you will feel after seeing that this atrocity has not yet been created. Please, do yourself a favor, if you ever feel the need to see this and see thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, multiply that number thirty times and you will only receive a small fraction of the horror that you would be in the store. for. In short, I suppose you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are willing to feel scared by the worst performance in the business and an absolutely useless story. <br /> <br /> Real ranking, -10 Disgusting
