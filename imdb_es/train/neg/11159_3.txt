I saw this movie in an "advance" and I must honestly confess that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep. This photo was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break in the middle of the movie. I could not blame them, if this were not a true story, there had been no need for the second part of the image. Just before the movie moved forward in time, approximately ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
