This movie is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends is infected with a horrible virus of eating meat. Suddenly, the friends face each other in a desperate attempt not to contract the disease. <br /> <br /> "Cabin fever" is a horrible movie. On the one hand, it tries to be many genres at once. Is it supposed to be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a horror movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can say it. There is a serious scene at the beginning and a second alteration becomes funny. When the movie tries to be funny, the humor is quite insipid, excluding the ending. I really liked the ending. <br /> <br /> But aside from the end, I was quite disappointed and disgusted. Violence is worth shrinking, more away from the screen than frightening. The changes of tone within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in one movement. What are we supposed to get out of that? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Is that supposed to be fun? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateur. I did not care about most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was horrible. Like a horror movie, I did not know what I was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense, or scary. In the end, you remain indifferent, thinking: "What just happened?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to that question.
