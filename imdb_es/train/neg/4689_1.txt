Truly awful movie made by cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff. Enough decent movie, but for a time bomb movie totally devoid of any kind of tension. Ford, as someone put him here, strolls asleep even though he has his characteristic smile. There are some details around: the former Canadian army or the RAF, bombs disabled in the war, his wife is leaving, but none of these previous stories adds up to much. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why are you trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what period of time are we talking about here? The second world war or the postwar? I assumed the latter, which makes the bomber motive even more prominent. In general, however, only a horrible movie. There are a lot of good time bomb movies to skip this one. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting moment, almost at the same time of execution.
