Gadar is a really silly movie because it tells a false story. It's too unreal and it's a typical sunny movie that aims to attack Pakistan. The aim of the film is to divert viewers so they can think that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own shortcomings will not work. And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad. Most likely, the Sikhs will love the movie because they are wrong. The movie sucks and stinks with power. I think that only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10 I would, but the lowest one is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not look at this stupid and boring movie. Disaster.
