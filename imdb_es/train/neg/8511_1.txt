I could not, for my life, continue, understand or understand history. As the plot progresses, it also remains incomprehensible. I'll guess and say that there was a preproduction story / story problem that was never solved. Producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a film about a serial killer and the killer's search for the police. They ended up with too many things happening in the time limit of a forbidden movie. Very bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things and an excellent cinematography. In fact, a well-made movie with which one could enjoy and relax for a couple of hours.
