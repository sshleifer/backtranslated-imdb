The first time I saw this movie in MST3K. And although I made fun of my jokes, I do not think this movie was so bad. Of course it was a bit difficult to understand, obviously it is low budget, but had a plot very similar to Hitchcock and I can honestly say that when I saw the version that was not MST3K, I was really entertained. This movie is clamoring for a new version of Hollywood.
