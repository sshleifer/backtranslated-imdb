I felt that this movie started well. The performance was right and I felt the situation of all the characters, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. We never got enough information about the father to really feel his pain for all his involvement or the accumulation of animosity with Tobe. I mean, in a scene you see him admiring her for the tension and in another scene he almost takes her head off. Another problem with the film was that it only unraveled and lost all focus at the end, and I begged it to end. Any film with such a long and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or higher just for the performance. We are analyzing the general quality of the cinematic experience. In the case of this movie, the ending is so bad that I seriously contemplated simply leaving the theater. This movie attracted me and then it spit on me.
