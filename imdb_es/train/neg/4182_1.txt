This movie is not as horrible as most of the Sci-Fi Channel movies. I'm used to seeing gray CGI spots and amateur special effects, like fake blood close-ups that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other variation of syrup. However, I thought I had seen all the possible minimums that the science fiction channel could reach. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand inside a rubber sock that is frosted with syrup? Those are the main alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the sock rubber puppets. A talking hand comes out of the entrails of the victims, and the vampire on the vampire hunter's team can talk to these puppets in rubber socks in Transylvanian. How did the alien vampires of Transylvania learn? And is not Transylvania in Romania? So, should not they be speaking Romanian? Why does a small city have its own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and pass the rubber socks with your fingers moving clearly inside the heads of the aliens; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to use the faces of their victims. Then there are the simply ugly ones who seem to have many facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into the space colonies so they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think about everything. The above is fun and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third class cast of the Network TV rejections that make up this team of stereotyped angry heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why do almost all Sci-Fi Channel movies have to use main characters that are annoying, abrasive, rough or just unfriendly? I found myself hoping that the rubber socks they talked about would win.
