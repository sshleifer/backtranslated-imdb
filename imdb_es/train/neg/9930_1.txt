A ruthless and painfully amusing attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Blazing Saddles of Mel Brooks to his own weekly comedy, this is really as bad as some say it is! <br /> <br /> The track of laughter Only serves to remind the viewer that it is not surprising that everything in this supposed comedy is meant to be a joke and how desperate it is for laughter! <br /> <br /> However, it is interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to pass himself off as Cleavon Little. His shame is noticeable in every scene. It was much more fun in the HBO Devil movie than in this piece of cheese! <br /> <br /> Truly the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
