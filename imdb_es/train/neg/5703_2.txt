All in a moment, Disney makes one of these movies that surprises everyone. One that keeps you thinking until the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie will surely become a ghost and kill and rape your people. It's terrible. If you want a movie of "action" meaningless, meaningless and predictable, keep going. I think young children can enjoy this, as they like when ALWAYS Good wins. But to me, I like the films in which it is a release who will win. This movie never lets the bad guys have the advantage. In the end, when the heroes stay in an "inescapable" hole, you simply KNOW they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, you never have to think about a riddle or a track for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it may be. Watch this movie if you want to see some impressive designs, not if you want to see a good performance or a good movie. Go see a Superman movie, it would be much shorter and the children would like more. For example, the scene where Cage is fleeing armed armed men, and the bullets are deflected by the handrail of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just A LITTLE LITTLE) This movie shows the decadence of movies and the film industry to cheap jokes and boring and unrealistic actions, which this film offers in large quantities.
