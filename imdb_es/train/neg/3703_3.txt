I did not expect much from this movie, but boy-or-boy, I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good act here, you can not get the feeling that his character is real, I think the movie would have been a little better if the drama or the romantic scenes had been less part of the movie and more / He got involved Better mood. The film is as if the filmmakers had a bad hangover. In the "making of" they do not show a single smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave him three out of ten for the few smiles he gave me, but I never laughed!
