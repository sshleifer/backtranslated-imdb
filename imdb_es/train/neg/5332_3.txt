OK, the description of the "Indians" stereotyped in this story is simply INCORRECT. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the movie. I was thinking, OK, ... it was never so tanned in real life. It is one of the most obvious brown "Indian" makeups I have seen. It's as bad as the 'Indians' in 'F-Troop' and the old Hollywood westerns that were played by American Jewish and Italian actors and not by real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is fine, but it's usually sparse History and mediocre songs, as in all of Elvis' later films. He did them because Colonel Parker had him tied to long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money as possible from Elvis! I still think 'thank God' that Elvis stopped making movies forever shortly after this movie came out. It's great to see the character actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, however. <br /> <br /> The "Indian" makeup of Burgess Meredith is absolutely AWESOME. It's the worst of the group for sure. What were the filmmakers thinking about? Was Mr. Meredith doing this just for money or what? Although I love certain Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand watching his movie with future television co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change of habit' in which Elvis plays a doctor in the city center. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, at least Elvis made FEW good movies, but the mediocre and the bad ones outnumber the decent and good ones. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you thank you very much!
