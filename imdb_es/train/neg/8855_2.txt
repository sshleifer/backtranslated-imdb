Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. I admit that a pretty good movie for werewolves started slowly, but gained momentum on the way to a good ending, then the presenter became a cute werewolf to be killed by the camera. Yes, that made an entertaining horror movie safe ... forget all that, since this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh, of course, somehow they manage to say that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something wants to know what and why things happened as they did, but they go from the small and cozy retreat of the first film to Transylvania or Somewhere here where they must fight the evil werewolves or something like that. I often wonder what the hell Christopher Lee was doing in this film, however, I read the triviality here where he says he's never been in a werewolf movie before, but I'm still reading the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into the hell of "An American Werewolf in London" that could have been possible. It was established in London after all. Hell, werewolves do not seem to figure much in this movie except for a rather strange and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the girl started talking loudly and this guy's ear started to bleed.
