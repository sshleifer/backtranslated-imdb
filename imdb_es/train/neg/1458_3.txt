The back cover of the DVD (this one was lost when it came out) acclaims Hitler, the Rise Of Evil as "A Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well, it does not matter the Post but really, whoever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art should be fired. <br /> <br /> I do not have anywhere to start. Why try to paint the image of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was evil, but now his character is presented in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the soft and subdued way in which he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are Well, then you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned within their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: this is the second time in his honorable career when he ends up playing an old and unsuccessful leader in a failed film (or, in this case, television production, to be exact). The first was, of course, the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes would only fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is fine if it is on TV and you have nothing else to do, but believe me, it is better to leave it on the shelf of your local Virgin store.
