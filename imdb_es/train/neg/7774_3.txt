For a half hour or so, I remember thinking, "Hey, this could be Bill Rebane's best achievement!" The initial sequences are atmospheric, immediately there are some moments of fear to enjoy and our director even refers to his own stinking "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill," with three old and extremely bored millionaires who lure nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in a elimination game. Naturally, the participants begin to fade quickly and one by one, and it takes too long for the remaining greedy greedy before they realize that the old ones are sadists ... or that there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange narrator who tells a lot of nonsensical things that are not relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there are some good T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and that silly bimbo (Shelly, I think it's called) It is very fun to watch. After the first half hour, the inevitable inevitably occurs and "The Cold" becomes a Rebane-production textbook with delayed plot twists, silly dialogues and a total lack of enthusiasm. There was no budget for bloody murder sequences, but our director with multiple talents (?) Tries to compensate this with endless images of disco dancers and an amateur rock band. The movie also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them is a bit satisfying. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live happier and happier.
