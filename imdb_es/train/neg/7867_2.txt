Okay, I've tried and I've tried, but I DO NOT GET this Guy Maddin thing yet. Tales From the Gimli Hospital left me cold, that movie about the Austrian villagers and that of the ice nymph was pretty but I had nothing in the history department ... and this movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. I am glad that Maddin appreciates the silent film, but I do not like his films for the same reason that I dislike the Quentin Tarantino films: they are empty tributes to better and more imaginative films, films that have advanced or disappeared. New terrain - and they are all stylish and without substance. No amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that Maddin is an unlikely original David Lynch contender, although he has an advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write embarrassing dialogues, because most of his films are based on intertitles . The conclusion is that Maddin's program is an intelligent and intelligent film making for aspiring big movies.
