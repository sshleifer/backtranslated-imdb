I've seen 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I'm continuing, except maybe hoping it gets better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is coming out of the commercials, with no real humor. While we were sitting watching these shows, we all speculated about what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of the cave woman with an attitude was really a great moment, yes, for us. She is coarse in a theater and she is tough with strangers, and the truth is that she needed a slap. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a good critic, and I like everything, but I must say that Cavemen is comparable to the Old show, my mother, the car. I give it a 2, just because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.
