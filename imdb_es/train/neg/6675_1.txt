This weekend just happened I saw "28 weeks later", which was very good. After that I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you it's one of the most boring horrors you've ever seen. The scenes were not realistic, there was no script or argument. The alien creature was unreal. And the soft fight scenes compared to a fight in the school yard. And to make matters worse, the guy named Cody had a dirty, uncontrollable tongue that distracts attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; I prefer to go and see 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Regards, Mesake C.
