From the moment the movie starts, there is already a discrepancy. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and it is also an international film, one would expect the right accents to be presented. This is not done since most of the cast sound American. Also, it seems to me that the performance is rehearsed at best, the story line is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very precise in costumes and set design. If you want to see a movie to get an idea of ​​what it was like in the past (although lack of accents), this movie is worth a rent. If you're looking for a film as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
