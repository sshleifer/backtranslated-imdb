Anita and I seem to be little more than an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of the novel and the script, to express her prejudices, her complaints and her general antipathy towards the English. The general feeling of Indian superiority over English in this film is disgusting. <br /> <br /> The English in this film are portrayed as overweight, violent, ill-spoken, promiscuous, involved in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor and foolish food: revealingly, just By resorting to Indian culture you can "redeem" the local priest at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Indian families are beautiful, intelligent, educated, can speak many languages, are loving and loving parents, and fodder for grammar. The film is so insidiously damaging that I'm surprised the BBC has funded it. If it had been the other way around, an English family in an Indian community represented in this way, the film would have been seen as racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow shot up so high on my forehead. , I thought you would stay in my hair. First, the scene of the gossip among the women in the celebration of Divali - insufficient text: the English are dirty and promiscuous - and the men - insufficient text: the English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the meal with Anita, where Neema's family lies about the cutlery: the subtext: the English are so stupid, you can make them do anything. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt for anything, even English. Weddings are an object of contempt - it is evident throughout the entire film. The character of Anita was drawn so frightfully, almost the trope of the fallen woman, that I finished the film feeling angry. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Bend it like Beckham" where humor focuses on loving. exaggerations of the behavior of a community and the customs of someone within that community, and it is a film about two girls from different backgrounds who come together. Instead, Anita and I seem to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, since the English are almost a version of the Indian untouchable caste, and this is underlined by a series of attacks on the "other" community of the film. : English. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and I are a job full of hate and based on complaints. On that basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
