The twisted ends can be really great in a movie. It's especially interesting when the turn is right in front of our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. That kind of twisted endings are what make people think. Then we have turns like this movie. In this respect, whether you pay attention or not, you have no idea what will happen. When they reveal this type of random turn, instead of shock, it is a somewhat confusing reaction. This movie begins as if it were an interesting version of the horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's just a boring dialogue and a stupid turn. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods and hitting the trunk of a tree. They end up in the house of a creepy old woman, who hates men, and are greeted by her welcoming daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange things happen when these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense advances towards a silly slasher. <br /> <br /> This movie is too caught in your dialogue. and it's always among a few characters. We have the three main girls, the spooky spinster and the old woman, and important conversations do not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite maddening to sit through your conversations. We want to know what's happening, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (almost nothing). <br /> <br /> Holes abound here. The house in which these girls stay when they get into their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere ... oh, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill them. Why did not they take the worker to this family that was driving to the city? Did you have a car? How is it that these girls never question the possibility of leaving and simply stay voluntarily, rarely even control each other? Why did this have to have so many silly turns? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a movie with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely there, but it's definitely silly. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 79 minutes R for nudity and violence.
