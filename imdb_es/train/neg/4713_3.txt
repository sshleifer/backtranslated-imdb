As you can guess, according to my rating and my title of this review, I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people will say: "How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever seen it?" I saw this show a couple of times because I'm studying film and animation and this just does not work. I hold a candle by my standards. <br /> <br /> First I want to talk about animation because it is one of the most confusing things I have seen. Like the first two seasons or just the first season had hand drawn animation. I thought it was a good show to see when it was drawn by hand, but then it changed to flash animation and the quality went down a lot. <br /> <br /> So that's a blow to my eyes but lets look at the history of the show. It's too hard to be like Dexter's laboratory, but there are differences because instead of a redheaded scientist there are two and both are women. There is a dog that speaks (why?), And the attitudes of the parents change a bit. I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean to curse, but I want to say that I do not know if there is a limit to the words). Everything else, however, is perfect, even a DeeDee character, Johnny himself. Just try to be Dexter, but it seems like an imitation without a heart. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about the jokes. Do you remember in the Dexters lab some of the jokes involved screaming? Yes, shouting may be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also had shrewd comments that made me have to go back and verify to get the joke. Johnny Test simply forgets all that and just screams 50% of the time and stops the music every time a stupid joke or a line trace appears. That's not comedy, that's stupid comedy (I know what some people are thinking, are not stupid comedy three stupid things? Look at that and Johnny Test on your back and laugh more at the first option). Sometimes jokes are based on strange situations that, like Chowder, drive me crazy. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: the strange is not the same as comedy, it only makes you think "What am I seeing?". <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is evidenced in all the accounts. Do not watch this program if you have any respect for comedy in any form, form or form.
