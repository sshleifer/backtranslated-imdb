I saw it by chance one lazy summer afternoon. I was playing on the HBO family programming channel. At first I was attracted, so I thought it was a Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote control, so I could find the 'INFO BUTTON', to find out what the hell was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy it in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is an artist of voice-overs. Of course it has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it works only as part of a larger visual package. Attaching his voice to a cute duck made the observation difficult. As for the rest of the cast, without inspiration. I guess working on this movie did not attract the very good voice about the talent that exists. <br /> <br /> So, weak voice talent, strong animation ... to whom was this film directed? Gay teenage ducks? I do not understand it. Is there really such a shortage of role models for young and future homosexuals that we should turn to animated ducks? Nice story, and like the title, this movie seemed hard to love, like an ugly duckling.
