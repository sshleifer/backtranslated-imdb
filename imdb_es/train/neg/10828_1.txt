That is not only my verdict considered in this film, but also in most of what has been written about it. Now do not misunderstand me either, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough like the 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share or artistic things, I swear. <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is poor, and I'm honestly puzzled as to why it seems to be so acclaimed. Long-winded, indulgent, meaningless and meaningless from beginning to end, there is so little that could credibly be what people love about the movie. There are some high caliber actors just, and none deliver an average performance or worse. Also, my wife (who confessed to Tom Cruise) tells me that it is her best performance in her career by far. But the plot is so unattractive, winding through the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a slow pace that even when representing significant events that change lives, they seem so useless and uninteresting that you find yourself crying out for someone to explode or something A) Yes. . <br /> <br /> It does not help that any of the characters is very easy to identify or empathize with (well, I did not think so, but most people do not like it). All of them develop their rather uninteresting life stories, demonstrating their defects and emotions of character with such intricate details and developing their deep and meaningful relationships until the ninth grade with many solosquios along the way. Yadda yadda yadda The soundtrack is also serious, with that quality so irritating that it sucked the marrow that until now had been considered exclusive to the music of Alanis Morisette. <br /> <br /> In general, it was as enjoyable as three hours to force her to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' while being beaten intermittently in the ribs by an angry nanny goat. However, the bit with the frogs is good.
