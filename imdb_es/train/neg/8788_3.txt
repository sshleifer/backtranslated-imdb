What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and low profile story manages to catch your interest at first and then gradually disappoints you more and more until you stay scratching your mystified head by the time you reach your exaggerated conclusion. . Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault; It was a pleasure to see him return as the protagonist of a new movie once again, looking a little wrinkled, but still achieve a solid and sincere performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with his wandering spirit in life after death (it's not a new idea), apparently being contacted by her through that funky electric business you see on your television screen when nothing is transmitted. br /> <br /> The idea that spirits communicate through radio waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I will not comment about what I think about that, or about them. Let me say that I am totally in favor of the suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying fantastic movies like this, but what I can not tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be happening, which is where it was. He left stranded when the credits finally began to roll. Much static in fact. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, there are movies like this that completely disconcert me, but if a film does not clear up, I tend to consider that it's the filmmaker's fault, not mine (unless I saw it when I was too tired to concentrate or something like that). Well, for WHITE NOISE I was wide awake, with bright eyes and hairy tail, so guess who is to blame?
