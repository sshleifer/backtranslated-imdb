Lipstick is another failure of the brilliant film. I'm trying to think of something good that I could say about the movie, and I'm having trouble finding something. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing at the end of the movie. It was the best part. The writing and the script were not the worst I've found, but it could have been much better. The lipstick was very pleasing to the eye. The sets were very bright and pleasing to the eye. The cast was fine. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only viable character in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this.
