Jungle fever is too stylized, stereotyped, and essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong with the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there is a lot of talent in this film, it is mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. In addition, instead of simply showing racism as ugly and stupid as it is, Spike Lee chooses to wave it like a flag in the most irritating and plaintive way. I did it through most of the movie, but I could not finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.
