Seriously. I have just finished my first Demonicus visualization and the words have failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw the name of Charles Band in a movie and my heart was racing. It was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. It was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movies came to the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still moved stronger than most of the junk that we otherwise had to put up with. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious Californian path duplicates for "the Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be "an ancient cave". I mean, they did not even try to dress the thing with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was more than just an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator, as indicated on the cover, they invite us to a guy who wears the latest Halloween clothes from Wal-Mart. There is a corpse that looks very good, that occasionally comes alive and wags your fingers, but does not even learn to stop until the last five minutes. Why could not he be the villain? Instead, we have the frat boy Joe with a plastic sword. Auch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is related to that gut. I love movies that are so bad, they are good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a movie that is so bad, it's just bad. This, however, is simply inadmissible. A perfect example of making money, instead of making a quality film.
