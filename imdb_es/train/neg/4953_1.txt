I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I must do it after watching The Batman animation. It's absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early '90s, so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? I look forward to writing a letter of complaint to WB. The original animation was dark and melancholy, exactly the way Batman was meant to be. WB had to ruin this with some Batman guts of the future. Now they produce this nonsense. The Joker does not remotely resemble the Joker of DC comics. DC must sue. I urge everyone who agrees to send me an email or write to WB and use the power of the people to recover the original formula
