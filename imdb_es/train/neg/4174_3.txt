Whoo-boy, that was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. Granted, I was on Sci Fi, and I do not see much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a thin plot of shaving and two-dimensional characters to the fullest. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, the plot and the surroundings were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, more fun, the blood was unnecessary, the special effects were horrible, and the end? Well, the only unpredictable thing about the end was when, suddenly, the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts doing it with the vampire woman, which, by the way, is not so good, considering that it happens for about three seconds, during the which are closest to "What the hell?" then "man, that's hot." If this ever appears in repetitions, God forbid, DO NOT LOOK AT IT.
