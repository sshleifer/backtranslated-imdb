I was very disappointed in this movie. I do not know much about the real story, so I was eager to see it captured in a movie and educate me about a small part of the story. With such a powerful real story and great actors, it seemed like a safe combination. Well, somewhere the script failed them. She was so scattered, is this movie about her childhood? your love life? your own disability? Your ability to speak? Your passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all those things into a good story, but this movie was not. I was cold seeing people who were not unpleasant not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other small complaints: 1. The hard-hit soundtrack. It's the seventies. We already achieved it! 2. If you are such a phenomenal public speaker, why did not you treat us more than a fragment here and there, and even mostly in montages?
