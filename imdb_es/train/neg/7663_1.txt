Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (generally great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE !!!! Personally I just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You are in Here is an idea, only my humble humble opinion like the movie that is made public, but it follows directly with your previous choices, a film about the most brilliant neurophysicist in history. Invent a pill to cure all the diseases that man has known and obtained. The deciding factor is that they must be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would love that. Seriously though, you owe me $ 7.50.
