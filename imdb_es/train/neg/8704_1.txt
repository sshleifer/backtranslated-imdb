In general I like dinosaur movies, but this is pure garbage. Without a script, without dialogues, without acting. And the brave Colonel Rance, who tries to prove that he is hard and curves his mouth, looks like a twin brother, the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not a waste of money when I watched the movie on TV). And I really can not understand 7 people who qualified this sh * t 10. They must have joked. My advice, if you see this title run from it!
