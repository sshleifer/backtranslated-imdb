I have not seen this movie in years, but I thought I would comment on it anyway, mainly because the memory of not liking is recorded in my memory cells. The original GETAWAY was not a prize to start, but at least it had the distinction of being 1) A film by Sam Peckinpah, 2) Highlights Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) It was a relatively painless way to fly an hour and halftime. <br /> <br /> By comparison, the 1994 version is presented as little more than a piece of vanity for the red-hot Alec Baldwin and his soon-divorcing wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife, Allie McBride, also split up shortly after they made their version of the film and one can imagine the Baldwins in their marriage counselor discussing who the stupid idea of ​​making this film is. <br /> <br /> Let's know and let's get out of the way: Alec Baldwin has never been or will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake bothers me is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin's part to show off challenges our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. As someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a piece of satire meant to parody the genre of action / adventure theft. By contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger and company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, since only the unprincipled villains and villains of Michael Madsen and James Woods appear as real people. <br /> <br /> The movie is also decidedly cruel, energetic and unpleasant on a fundamental level that is hard to put into words. A visit was more than enough, not only because he had nothing new to offer, but also because of the ingenuity with which it was made. Peckinpah's movie was actually a small, stylish entertainment that had a lively atmosphere, where this version is a slog that takes too long to get to little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for its existence and some of the most uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the movie difficult to enjoy. <br /> <br /> So I do not know, this was probably one of the movies that helped. to start the wave of remakes of big budgets artistically insensitive and overwhelmed around an actress / actress of the brand of that time, which in itself is not something really good. I always prefer to see a filmmaker, at least try to come up with a new idea for a film and fall for something original. This movie just made me want to get my eyebrows off, and it's telling that in the next 15 years since its release, Mr. Baldwin has become one of the biggest Hollywood idiots. Thank God for "Team America" ​​for putting him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
