After a promising first 25 minutes that make you feel warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling could still be there, but as others have said: The plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to see it. <br /> <br /> The film speeds up, and you get the impression that you are moving fast, or that the producers decided to adjust it in less than 1h40m and had to cut many scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an objective in itself, but as a spectator, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, it simply is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors and, despite the bad script, I think the actors' performances are mainly good. If I could qualify only the first 25 minutes, I would probably give it an eight. As it is now, he puts on a four. ... and that's good! <br /> <br /> If you like romantic comedies, anyway, you'll probably have a great time. If not, I recommend that you see something else.
