Oh boy, where do I go with this? Herendous acting, weak plot, stupid deaths, nonsense nonsense ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... this is hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, your time or your life in this pit of evil. <br /> <br /> It's just ... damn it, this movie is horrible! Tom Savini, WHY? Why would you waste your life on this shit? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather snort and break my head against a wall than see THIS ... this sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please, follow my advice and stay away from the k @ of this elephant of a movie. Do not you know that? I should not even have to call this a movie thing! Just stay away!
