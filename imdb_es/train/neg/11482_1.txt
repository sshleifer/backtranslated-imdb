In everything you've seen when Harry met Sally, then avoid this one. Not only will it make you hit your head against the table, because, why Bollywood can not make a good remake? But it also bothers you with the so-called funny moments in it. Miss the charm of the movie. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act as if he were an actor's hell. The plots that have been collected from the original, do not seem effective either. The part in which both bring their friends and play a note does not seem attractive. What can be more disastrous? you want to spend some money, this is what you can get. Otherwise, put a little more money, and look at the original. It's too good to get lost ..
