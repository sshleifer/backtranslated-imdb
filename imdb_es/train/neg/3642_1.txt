Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with making boring social comments in a real event, but it does not have the balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid player), or that media and music lack all influence is the obvious message (we even have a ridiculous scene of the two children). burning ALL his CDs, speaks of subtlety!), but the movie only gets away with it because it is 'fiction'. Nice try. Yes, it is a great idea to alleviate the influence of the media, but how do we know the children who have really planned and executed a school shooting without influence of the media? or the video games? We do not do it, and we do not do it with this film because, once again, these children are smart enough to completely renounce the media, but foolish enough to burn a Nazi symbol on the ground. haha, somehow, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The movie hits you in the head with your representation of normal families, it's almost disrespectful to think that there was not a serious flaw in the family Dynamics of the children that have really come out and They have shot their classmates. Why are everyone so preoccupied with making killers look "normal" when they are so obviously not? A completely false and false representation.
