I heard about this movie and I knew it was not very good. But I started watching the movie (in my movie channel) and I was interested. This could really be a great dark satire in today's media morale. The small featurettes in each contestant were good. It accumulates to something that I would not like to lose. But when the so-called show begins, everything becomes unlikely, cheap and quite silly. This is where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead he is involved and assuming that people are so stupid. <br /> <br /> The ending is so bad that I give it a 1. Even if the movie starts being promising.
