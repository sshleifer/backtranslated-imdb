Hollow Point is a movie that is worth a half price rent or if there is nothing else at a good time, without thinking. There are the necessary explosions and the hammy performance and pretty ladies. A pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the lovely Tia Carrere. This cast and a cheerful touch make it not a great movie, but a fun one ... on a scale of one to ten ... to 4
