['When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor&#39;s wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this is not a comedy, it&#39;s a ridiculous masterpiece . of stupidity. The title is well chosen, except for one thing: you could add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give it 0 and a half of 5.']
