This was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no substance, the main character, Martin Cahil, has zero values ​​of redemption, in fact, everyone in him, including Jon Voight, personifies the sprain. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is disagreeable, although artistically made. Filming is black, at least the impression I saw fits this category. A disappointment.
