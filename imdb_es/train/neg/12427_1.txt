I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, acting HEAVY, REAL, REAL, stupid, real criminals who were not even funny at least BIT (unlike the first 2 movies only at home that were very good). all the explosive traps are weak, pathetic excuses for badly copied ideas from the first two, which meant that the people who wrote this movie were lazy because their paycheck did not exceed $ 20 per week. This movie is absolutely bad, it's not worth even renting it. In fact, do not even see it on television! Go use your eyes in a more useful way to see the first two! I just give this 1 star (out of 10). Just trust me when I tell you, if you liked the first two, and you're not a completely stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie!
