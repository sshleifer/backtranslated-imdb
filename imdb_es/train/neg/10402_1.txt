Well ... tremors, the original started in 1990 and I found the movie quite pleasant to watch. however, they proceeded to do tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one. Now, only God Himself is able to answer the question "why in the name of God would they create another one of these dips in film dumpsters?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact, it can not even be considered an epitome of a bad movie, since it does much more than that. Even though I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I waited fervently for the little girl in the ring to crawl on the television and kill me. Did you really think that dressing the people who had seen the other movies as if we were from the wild west would make the movie (with exactly the same occurrences) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
