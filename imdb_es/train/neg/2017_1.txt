The plot is plausible but banal, that is, the beautiful and careless wife of a rich and powerful man has an adventure with a psychotic piece, then tries to hide it while the psycho stalks and blackmails. But, what develops from there is superbly illogical. Despite the resources available to the regular couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have only one domestic agent, his lawyer and the local police (who say they can not do anything) at their disposal while struggling with suspense and terror. They do not have private security personnel (only a sophisticated security system that they mishandle), house or garden staff, drivers, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private nurses 24 hours a day to take care of the hero when he suffers. Injuries that threaten life, leaving the man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is represented as having the brain of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most improbable and irrational way. The production is an insult to the spectators who squandered their time with this folly and a crime for having wasted the talent of the veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offer.
