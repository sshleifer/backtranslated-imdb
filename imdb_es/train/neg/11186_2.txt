I wanted to see this movie, but one weird ridiculous scene after another forced me to turn it off. The character does not seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking one night (through a graveyard, I think) when he is attacked by spirits, who walks away. Once this test is over, he moves away calmly and meets a friend who saw everything. When asked what happens, he says openly "attacked by demons, nothing serious," as if this was just a little more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I turn it off when they are going to ask something ... A demon or something, I stopped worrying, a question. The answer can only be rented to someone with the energy of his death, and the priest observes in what seems to be a vague annoyance when a man is tied and hung up and they ask a question to the body of a dying and dying man. <br /> <br /> 0 of **** stars.
