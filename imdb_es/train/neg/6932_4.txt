I've waited a long time to see DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after seeing it, I felt really disappointed. It is not the baroque film I was expecting. The trailer (which I saw on a DVD of Something Weird) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no outstanding scenes in it and the look is interesting, but it does not even come close to other Baroque films, like Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and there is almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TDR TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk. -More than anything else. It was almost like looking at a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or encouragement or something, instead, we see / hear the main characters chatting incessantly about boring things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
