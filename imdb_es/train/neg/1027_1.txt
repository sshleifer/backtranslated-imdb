Normally, I have much better to do with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed in this film that I spent an hour registering in IMDb to remove it from my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a profitable bet ... well, this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should dedicate himself to music, what a horrible performance: there is NO presence as an actor, he is NOT a character. I can not blame everything on Justin: the film also has a terrible plot and a poorly scheduled edition; It is definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to ask myself what really motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan really read the script before taking the role. Did not he see how poor he was? So, what could motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting sometimes is more about who you see yourself with, rather than actually developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really tries hard to come to an agreement with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience says: "What the hell is going on here? Do you expect me to believe in this shit?" <br /> <br /> In summary, apart from Justin, a great mis-executed lineup - very disappointing.
