Very funny to see "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural garbage film. It's like an answer to the type of movie b by Jess Franko. Bodybuilders counterattack (face to face!) The aggressors. The blow very, very stupid! Action: Incredibly bad scenes of shots (shots) directed look even better than hand-to-hand fighting. Ridiculous scenes They keep scenes of incredibly stupid beauties. The erotic scenes are very little erotic. The main luck of the film is beautiful landscapes and scenes of festivals. t miss: the joke of Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of the film and the list of relatives of Franco Columbu at the end. Special attraction: naked breast. Forgotten: Franco can sing!
