This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. They tricked me into thinking that it could be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman for taking this role. I was physically sick after seeing this movie. I do not really understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can slide over the top and get the best. That way, the worst movie you do is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this mud. The gags like the hair doll and the shamelessly discarded jeans ads added to the film's lack of humor. I'm glad to have avoided this movie and seen it on TV. This shows that you should avoid January launches at all costs.
