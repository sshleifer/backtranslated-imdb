John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie), falsely accused and persecuted by the skirt, change their identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones." Mr. Chandler is supposed to be "Reverend Smith," but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith." At no time neither of them is as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; although, Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, in terms of his career. The beautiful blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), an adult of her days in "Our Gang", is a great interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's low-budget films of the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
