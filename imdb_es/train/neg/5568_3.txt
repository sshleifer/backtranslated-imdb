Dolph Lundgren plays a former police / boxer who searches the perverse scene in Boston to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought of in the community, however, along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed perverse sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good at this movie, in fact, based on his performance here, one would forget that Lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. That said, the material does not give Lundgren anything to work with, in fact, Lundgren is left to dry completely in a suspense film that is predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact, the film works best when it focuses on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, in fact, if the film had taken the time to explore their relationship, the film would have been pretty decent. However, the film is mediocre, the action does not exist, the plot has not been explored enough (too boring B around Lundgren's investigation into his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily bloody and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is really good (just like newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film only moves from one sequence to another, which makes this film particularly disappointing. However, if there is anything else, it shows how underestimated Lundgren is, as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (poor)
