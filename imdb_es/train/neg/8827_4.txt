I love 80's slasher movies and I remember when they released "Silent Night / Deadly Night" from our theaters, I felt very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what I expected from this type of movie. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous by today's standards, the development of the character for a long time, but in general it was laughter to laughter! <br /> <br /> The scenes where he loses because Santa Claus, also known as dad, is feeling his mother and later when the mafia is shown torches lit, not the lanterns as in the 80s, But the real torches! - It really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes in which I was watching the children in their neighborhood gave me a spooky feeling of another nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who were some of these character actors. It took me a while to realize that the main character was the adorable teddy bear of the Brothers.
