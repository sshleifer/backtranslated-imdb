Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character in this movie. It's just in that. Most of the screen time is dominated by jokes without grace. A running gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also many erection jokes, where the line of the blow is that someone has an erection. This movie is as fun as Kirstie Ally's British accent is compelling. <br /> <br /> This movie started out as a weak action movie: five minutes of later history and then bam! Jokes without grace. But, apart from the terrible writing, the film is also badly directed and the acting is terrible. In addition, this film makes the old clich√© of the bad comedy of having many well-known B movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, even though he is considered the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a pharmacy that sells for five dollars. Even that is too much.
