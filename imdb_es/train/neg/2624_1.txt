To say that this movie sucks would be insulting to skunks. As the other commentator says, this movie is an insult to anyone over 7 years of age (it's especially insulting to gays). It's horrible, and not in a "bad as funny" way, it's just horrible. No, I have to say it: STOP! (Sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the opening credits to the final titles, there are barely more than 10 seconds of this movie for which it is worth opening your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the performance is about the superior assault "look at me, I'm being funny" The school and so on. The pieces are badly made (if any) and are poorly executed, it is horrible on all fronts, apart from the music, I do not remember thinking that the music sucks (apart from the songs). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the manufacturers, they put their cards on the table rather quickly: the opening credits include the title "Also starring Ertha Kitt as Betty's voice, the meteor" (since the meteor in question never occurs). never say anything, just make an occasional purr noise, you may have deleted Mrs. Kitt's contribution from one of your records) and the second line of the movie says something like: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus. "Uranus -" your anus "geddit? geddit? eh eh ?? Your anus? Humor is really so cheap. <br /> <br /> He says strange things about the "comedies" of that period when it was perfectly permissible for the hero to deliberately shoot dead people on the street but not say "sh * t" aloud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pennies (approximately $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel cheated
