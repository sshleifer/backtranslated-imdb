Damn, I thought I had seen some bad westerns. I can not overcome this one though. Hell, I think I'd prefer to have my eyes opened for a triple Trinity function to cry out loud. I do not think I can see Ben Hur again without laughing. Really very bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like stupid westerns with well-known stars, check out Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much more fun. 1/10
