This film is the first year effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it has some problems, as with all low-budget productions, it's a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not terribly new, since it was made in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th from part 2. But, the performances are sincere. So many big budget movies only make the actors follow the movements, it's always good to see the actors really trying to perfect their craft. <br /> <br /> The story is about the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others swear to keep the secret, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, the friends are killed one by one by a frightening stalker known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You have to look. <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably should not bother. But if your taste runs more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people perfecting their craft, then watch "The Bagman".
