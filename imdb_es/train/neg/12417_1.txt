Any movie that starts with a cowboy fighting with a calf can not promise much. As for the stereotypes of the kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, well, I was there and it was not like that. Okay, all the kibbutz had only a small part of something that is shown in the film (like the young people who assault the kitchen at night) but it can not be shown that all the kibbutz are full of all those, say, naughty traits . Each kibbutz had its own problems, but almost no kibbutz had all of them. Israel's opinions were great. I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and the performance was also good, so you can see that it was not all black, just a misrepresentation, probably also on purpose.
