The writing of the journalists and the demanding and reckless fearful press officer and the grandmother sobbing were ridiculed and loaded with clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors, but surely someone must have said "you're kidding, I can not". Di This! "<br /> <br /> This episode had a perspective on the press and the perspective of the police, while the perspective of the police was sufficiently standard, the perspective and the characterization of the press were exaggerated and in some points They were incredibly amazing. <br /> <br /> I realized that it was a HBO co-production, if so, maybe the stereotypes of the deck can be explained from that point of view, <br /> <br /> I was completely cramped during the press conference scene, it lacked credibility and it did not seem remotely true, 40 minutes after the first episode and I'm still waiting for the suspense. <br /> <br /> Skip five days. of 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more suspenseful, even if the crime is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This story had unforgivable moments that can only be described as incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> For a press officer to start a press conference without a researcher present to answer the questions of the press. <br /> <br /> so incredible that it felt like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Then I started looking for journalists called "Scoop" and for Perry White to make his appearance. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 Hunter before "five days" arrived in Australia, without realizing it was a prequel and waiting for Bonneville and McTeer to go around again. <br /> <br /> Shaky head.
