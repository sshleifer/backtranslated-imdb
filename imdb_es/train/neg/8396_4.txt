... but I've also seen better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable: a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred. Three guess what happens. This is not a total bomb, the cast is pretty good with the professionals John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine giving the best performances. It is reasonably well done, for a low budget movie. Just do not expect nudity, insults, blood or blood (the movie has a very mild PG rating). I never got totally bored, it's good to see him on a quiet night. I saw it in the video, it was a HORRIBLE impression, very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Still, I did not hate it and it has a great ending that surprised me. Basically, nothing happens until then, so he catches you off guard. It's worth watching but only if you're a full horror movie.
