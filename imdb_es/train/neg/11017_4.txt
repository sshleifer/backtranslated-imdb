A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive. The unfaithful husband wants her dead and decides to take advantage of her phobia by putting her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, the queen of the B-horror movie Brinke Stevens transforms into The only reason to see this amateur garbage movie is Michael Berryman in a small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage are pretty fun to watch. Special effects, for example, are ridiculous. The decapitated head is truly horrible. Better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course I do not expect an elegant entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be nice.
