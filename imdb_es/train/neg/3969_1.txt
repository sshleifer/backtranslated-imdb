I'm writing this because I somehow felt led to believe that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst I've seen, it's certainly not good. <br /> <br /> A weak script, weak actors and weak direction. Even if they can not afford the cast of big names, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to see a simple actress throughout the movie with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and poorly written. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks used repeatedly here were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains is not worse than some of the Masters of Horrors episodes. But it's still not up to par with quality films. Dark Remains is only recommended for horror fans who do not want to miss any movie of the genre, even if it is a bad movie. As for any other person, you should invest time in something more valuable, which should be extremely easy.
