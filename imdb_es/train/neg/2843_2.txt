Oh, yes, Sakura Killers is a ridiculous and ridiculous ninja movie, make no mistake. But it is also incredibly nice. This is due in large part to the impressive presence of one Chuck Connors, who is considered the protagonist of the film, but in reality only shines in some scenes. I suppose it's supposed to be some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi guy ("The hard ninja-hunter" exclaims the copy of the box) but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says that this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration. <br /> <br /> But in reality, his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, have a dialogue so horrible that 'Brooklyn', as we call it The Colonel, Tends to shine in comparison. Pay special attention to Dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splice' with which Sakura is involved. If you know something about cloning, you will die laughing. And yes, this is an important point of the plot, friends. <br /> <br /> A very funny movie, Sakura Killers is a difficult gem to find. Nor will I ruin the end of the 'trick' for you, except that it is a perfect setup for a Sakura Killers 2. It's a shame that Chuck Connors died. :-( Because it has the softest ways to fly ninjas.
