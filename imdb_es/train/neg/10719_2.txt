I would not say that this was totally horrible, but if it were not for Netflix, I would not even have this in my house. Steve Martin, the eccentric president of a chain of health food stores, collapses. He just is not funny. He is another in a lot of SNL rejections that can only find work in the next SNL movie. The delivery trainer with the Elmer Fudd lisp is as fun as it is original. Amy Poehler simply performs the same movements as she would for a 7-minute SNL skit, which is as fun as SNL lately. The only thing that applies to this movie is that Tina Fey is easy to see. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard that your character could not get pregnant. The theme might have been open to other comedy attempts, but it seems to simply continue to simmer, not really entertaining or creating laughter.
