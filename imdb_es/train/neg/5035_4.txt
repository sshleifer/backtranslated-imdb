Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner and she is discovering her sexuality with children. But it turns out that all the guys she spends time end up murdered in this generic movie of the 80s. It depends on local bailiff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying daughter of two shoes, lover of the mysteries, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th of part 3), to get to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the aspects of mystery and melodrama of the film and less on the murders themselves and, therefore, is able to differentiate itself from many of the Slasher brothers of the ' 80 It does not hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by stating that the actress is over 18 years old and, therefore, to convey that I am not too perverted). On the downside, the film is hampered by some plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grid theme that is used a bit too often and an ending that is a bit anti-climatic. But the good overcomes the bad (barely). Give a rent to this, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows off her tits, her bush and her butt <br /> <br /> My rating: C <br /> <Br /> Code Red DVD Extras: an introduction to the star Aleisa Shirley and the director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both the director and the theatrical version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; gallery still theatrical trailer for this movie; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, and Balalaika Conspiracy
