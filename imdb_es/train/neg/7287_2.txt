<br /> <br /> In his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his cousin, but his family forbade it. Many decades later, the elder has raised three children (two boys and a girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother # 1, and jumps into brother # 2's bed. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three brothers are trapped somewhere on a remote island. But no, they are upper-class Europeans who go to university and are engaged in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated woman and the two brothers. We never see any flirtatious moment between any unrelated man and the only sister. All flirtatious moments are shared only between the brothers and the sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was incest. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls everywhere, but no, he just wanted his sister? If the incest of the movie is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE (slowly) will thrill you to the end.
