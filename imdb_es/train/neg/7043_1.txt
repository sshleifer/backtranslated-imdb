I was ready to laugh throughout this movie as an experiment in the Mystery Science Theater, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many enthusiastic friends of the biker, and from there they decided to make a movie casually. <br /> <br /> It is often inadmissible. A lot of images of cyclists riding on a dirt road, with the same music that plays repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon probably would have encouraged things. Maybe he had other commitments the day it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, cyclists terrify a small city. Fights, murders, a cowardly cop, a silly mechanic, etc. One of the motorcyclists always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. . One of the scenes shows a motorcyclist assaulting a woman, shouting in the lady's face: "Everyone is the same! Everyone is the same!". We returned to the scene a minute later and he again declared: "Everyone is the same!". Could not the writer think of something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys have killed the bad guys. We also learn that the wedding between the middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college, and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still going on (but with a different girlfriend). End.
