OK, the picture looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg, standing next to Danny Glover, parodies the famous farmer and his wife by painting. Then you put this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It's supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit that I laughed once about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: a battered and mistreated neighbor, a boring legal trial, racisim, talk of lynchings and death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to anyone's opinions, do it here. You can not even force yourself to see this shit. SHIT! I said it, SHIT! Whoever names this must sue.
