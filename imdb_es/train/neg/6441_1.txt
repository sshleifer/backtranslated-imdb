When I looked at Wrestlemania's letter this year, I was very excited and could not control myself because I was filled with emotion. <br /> <br /> Start ... and finish. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry at hell for how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will go down like a classic and then you expect the same thing and you get the average trash they have from time to time. The only time in the whole show that ruined me was when HBK left !!!! That same moment of HBK losing JOHN DINNER !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a big loser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 when it beat TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after watching Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to see it again (thankfully). Once again, I have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the best I've seen in my life), which was a pure classical Wrestlemania. It definitely makes up for 'Mania 23 and it also gave us many memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you've seen ANY of the Wrestlemania before this, like the ones that make you a fan (Wrestlemania 20 became a fan), PLEASE, do not look at this and make the same mistake I made and leave WWE behind. And if you see it and you're angry, start watching it again and look at Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
