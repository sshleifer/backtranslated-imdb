I thought this would be a good movie, since I like zombies and horror movies in general. But I did not think it would be a piece of shit like it was. The only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and is run over by a damn car. The movie seems to be written by a porn director and full of porn actors, I would never call them actors! The costumes seem to be stolen from a local play. It looks like a road movie without almost monsters. There is no fun at all in this piece of shit, only horror, but not in the way the director intended. I'd rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again !!! ugh!
