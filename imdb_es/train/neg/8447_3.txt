I do not know what I missed here, but I can not believe all these positive comments from so many people in this movie. I thought it was silly, and a bit exaggerated. I liked the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, however, the others were just ... bored. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, I really like them, but this was a little bit lower in the alphabet for me. I saw someone compare humor and horror in this with "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", as well as "On a par with The Re-Animator". You must be kidding. I did not find this funny movie, I tried it, it made an effort, (possibly too much effort), but it failed in my opinion. The moment I was hit with the third or fourth sentences, I rolled my eyes and looked at my watch. <br /> <br /> Definitely tributes were made to several other films, which is always great, something like an internal joke for us terror fans. But here it may have been simply a lack of original thinking. It is true that there were some nice special effects, good blood, but they can not carry a full movie. The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut, and in the early stages of the mutation: Chet from "Weird Science" (after he became the monster) and one of the alien beings / creatures from "The Explorers". It just did not work. I thought it looked like something some children in the Grade 5 art class could have designed. Then there was Brenda, the woman Grant impregnated and chained in the barn. When the help finally arrived, it looked like a giant tick waiting to be exploited. The design, once again, was totally unimaginative. A round flesh-colored balloon with one face in the middle. * yawn * <br /> <br /> Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies these days, the more I wish that George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only author / director authorized to make movies about they. So far, she is the only person who does it well, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but that was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style of Zombie. Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie movie for me because of his ingenious ability to make his actors moan, complain and complain as if their joints were dry and lacked a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles fought against them. effects. caused by the rigor mortis that had begun to settle right before they were re-animated. The people of "Wheelsy" just did not have the right motivation ... they were horrible zombies. <br /> <br /> So in the end I give "Slither" a 3, for a couple of laughs and some nice blood scenes.
