How hard is it to write a movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in reality, it really did not matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and devised; the kind of "funny notion" scenes that are drugged too far from where the sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go "pulling the pull" at the end, what would have been appropriate if ANYTHING previous to that point would have been worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see how some people can enjoy this OK, as many people will take the garbage they are fed, but I would highly recommend waiting for a DVD in this. It's NOT worth it for the $ 23,978 you need to take your family to the movies these days.
