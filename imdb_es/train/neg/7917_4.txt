"Cemento" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition that has a bad man in a bad way until his concrete drawers dry quickly. While we wait for the cement and the film to dry to discover what it is about, periodically we go back in time without rhyme or reason so that we can see the events prior to the cement issue. A boring and boring film in general, "Cemento" suffers for the lack of a story, a clumsy execution and the most omnipresent of the failures of the filmdom; There is no reason to worry A time killer for the needy at best.
