This is a really silly movie. It could be fun with the fresh-looking aliens and the country setting, but it just is not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens listen to the War of the Worlds broadcast when a small rural radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill human beings, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act ridiculously. The cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space ... not really what they do. These are not aliens, they are stupid idiots with modulated and annoying voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice is also the alien of Jack Nicholson who always wears his sunglasses. Apart from the aliens, the acting is terrible. Obviously, the writing is aimed at children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 minutes PG for soft language.
