I can tell (on the one hand) the amount of good films starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The endless chase scenes, the tenuous dialogue and the terrible failures in the continuity made this film a prime option to get the shipment in MST3K. <br /> <br /> And that's the only way I could see this ...
