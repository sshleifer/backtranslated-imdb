A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), Eileen of 10 years (Blaze Berdalh and Gage of about 3 years old (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine, apparently without realizing the semis they roar down the road in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor on the other side (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets But a little further on is a sacred ground that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead come back in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good, it was For a long time, characters and situations were developed that made you care what happened, this film discards the whole development of the character and simply reproduces the blood and the violence.The animals are killed IN THE CAMERA (I know it is false but it is still repulsive o) a small child is hit by a semi and his chest is opened during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); life and attacks and kills people, including their mother (I DO wonder how a 3-year-old boy could hang it); A ghost runner (do not ask) tries to help the family without any reason ... The film simply makes the public take care that every dreadful death or violence comes to your face. It simply does everything possible to surprise you. ** END OF THE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Acting is useless. Midkiff is as horrible as the father: he's handsome and amateur but he's totally blank. Crosby is not much better. The two children are simply annoying. Only Gwynne alone saves this image with his good performance without effort. <br /> <br /> This image shows a total disregard for the audience that makes great leaps in logic and that the characters do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box-office success in 1989 that led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theater back then and I was disturbed how the audience continued to encourage violence and I was simply appalled by what I saw. . A sick and repulsive horror movie. A 1 in everything. <br /> <br /> When you think everything is over and it can not get worse, the Ramones sing a title song !!! ("I do not want to be buried in a pet cemetery"). Truly beyond belief.
