This movie does not make any sense at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive through huge NYPD vehicles. The characters do not act in any way plausible at all. I will put my comments on the chat panel, but save time and money, this is stupid. I can not stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses elegant editing and great music, and does not bother to have a plot that comes together even at the most basic level. But it's good to see Denzel W. prevail over Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There is even a sweet child with a video game that is nice.
