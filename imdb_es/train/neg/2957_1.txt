What a mess!! Why was this movie made? This and other films of his "caliber" should be teaching tools on how not to make a film. Children may like it, but anyone over the age of 10 can or disapproves. To make matters worse was the fact that a great talent like Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were completely wasted in a movie that did not deserve any notice.
