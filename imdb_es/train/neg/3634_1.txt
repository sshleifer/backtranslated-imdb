Bored children's fantasy that gives the star Joan Plowright the billing, but little to see. Sappy children pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a dancer and a baseball player (yuk), while the best friend, Hazel, runs for mayor, she is 13 years old! Totally pedestrian in every way, plus the added disadvantage of the juicy presentations of the girls and the baseball guys. Without a doubt, a smaller effort for Showtime --- without limits?
