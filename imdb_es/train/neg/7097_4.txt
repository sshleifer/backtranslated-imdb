['This movie has such an inexorable price in class B to all its scenes, effects, etc. that makes you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It&#39;s like watching some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars (apart from the content). <br /><br /> The story can be described in one word: FLOOR. And, my God, I do not remember a villain so uninteresting for a long time. We are not given a reason why it is so evil (an innate defect, they lead us to think :) nor any real conviction or style to its evil. <br /><br /> If you&#39;re out on Connery, go rent &#39;Hunting Forrester&#39;.']
