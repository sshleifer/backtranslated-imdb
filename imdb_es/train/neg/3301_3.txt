The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to be to start by throwing the plausibility out the window and continue on that path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a movie that makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are being stolen by a highly efficient gang of "military-style" thieves. Two police officers begin to investigate the case that soon becomes more complicated than it seems at first. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish films, the cast is mainly made up of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in all the Swedish films of the last years! But it's fine, I suppose since Persbrandt is one of the few who performs solidly here (as he usually does). The problems with this movie revolve around the story itself. In the first place, theft is felt primarily as a background. Rather, this is more a film about a young policewoman struggling to prove her worth in a male world (as has not been done a thousand times with a decent actress instead of Sophia Helin). There is also a completely incredible twist of the plot near the end that seems as plausible as the landing of the aliens. But still, I thought it was a nice touch considering he was half asleep at that moment. Specified things a bit (and actually saved the qualification to take another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same as with most other Swedish films of this type. Simply, the action and the suspense do not meet the standards to which we are accustomed in other movies of this type (mostly Hollywood). It feels cheap and quite weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget about trying to make the "Hollywood action" as they do now. Because this becomes another forgettable effort of the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
