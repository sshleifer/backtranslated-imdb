This movie is yet another in the long list of no budget, no effort, no talents movies recorded on video and with a dazzling cover to trick tenants tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what watching this movie is like, take a video camera and some red coloring and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and "attacking" the people. Congratulations, you just did "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it. <br /> <br /> I have seen a bit of budget, filmed in video films that showed the talent of filmmakers and actors or at least in an effort, but this has none. Avoid it unless you are a true masochist or you enjoy the badly made horror movies.
