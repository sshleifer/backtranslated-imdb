I think this is one of Kenneth Branagh's weakest Shakespeare plays. After such great efforts as Ado About Nothing, etc. I thought that this was poor. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???) but my biggest complaint was that they got into Bard's work and cut part of the play to put on the music / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You just do not do Shakespeare and then you get into the play. I'm sorry, but that's wrong. I love Cole Porter as the next person, but heavens, do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this and see "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest.
