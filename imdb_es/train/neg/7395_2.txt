As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first job of a young director. My question is whether this is the work of a normal boy who loves movies or if it is the work of a film student, since there is a reference to the Porto Arts School in the final credits. <br /> <br /> However, the director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this film a total ignorance of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you're studying film is how to tell a story. You learn that, as in the novels, in the movies you must also build your story in three acts: the introduction, the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story must have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there must be a climax. You learn that this is true for an epic 3-hour movie, for a normal movie, for a short movie and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second commercial. You also learn that there may be levels of subtlety in your approach to the academic structure and that, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> In general terms, TIM WATCHER presents his main character and then, the End of the movie: the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in AMÉLIE by Jeunet. There is no second or third act in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film, so you can not even try to justify the lack of respect for the academic structure. You expect them to tell you a story, and that does not happen. Worse than that, TIM WATCHER defines himself as a warning; and one without real purpose. It does not make a point, or at least, it is not valid. His point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The situations described are completely simple and their approach is Manichean. <br /> <br /> I expected much more from this short. The film begins with a fairly good sequence of credits and you quickly realize that you are seeing something with better production values ​​than the usual Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this film, but judging by the list of acknowledgments in the final credits, the merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where it is difficult to have the doors open for young filmmakers. <Br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with a good score. That is all. There is nothing else No plot. And that is a pity because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly, you can see in the regular Portuguese short the diversity of places and so many extras available to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison may seem, I must refer to the BMW shorts as a good example. of how you can tell a good story in a short film very conditioned to the placement of the product and to the cinematography with first level style.
