['The only reason why this movie has a rating of 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a plot thinner than the depression of the era of cabbage soup, the horrible performance and the special effects that seem to come from the television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, it is surprising that Widmark did not kill the director for putting this black mark on your resume. Even by 1950 standards, the special effects are atrocious, except for a couple of submarine underwater sequences. I can only assume that he was nominated for the best special effects because, except for 20,000 Leagues under the sea and THEY, there was no one else doing effects. It certainly was not a contest for Disney that year if this was their only competition. I would not recommend the film, not even for underwater movie fans, since the most realistic scene in the submarine was limited to a shot in which you can see the sea water dripping down the raised periscope. There are other much better sub movies that you can enjoy in this era, like the 20,000 Leagues or Torpedo Run mentioned above.']
