This had to be one of the worst movies in history. When Kate appears and Jed is with a group of guys and everyone starts to applaud ... so to Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands across the pavement, it looked like she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's performance is so bad in this movie, I could not connect with them or feel that they love each other. The other 2 women, however, were very good and eclipsed Andie. Anyway, this was such a cheesy movie. Usually, I like this kind of movies, but I just could not get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's performance did not help the film. Also, she is all gums. Lancome must make up with a spatula because she looks glamorous in commercials.
