I knew it was not a good job between me and the D wars from the moment we met. First his title was lazy. D war How to write, Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you really can not be so cheeky with your title unless you Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever it wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the demented progression of history. Here is the movie, a dreamy reporter reports on large snake prints, recalling a time when he and his dad got into what must have been the competition for the gremlin shop and a dreamy reporter finds a box that shines. The old store keeps several terrible truths. That Bauraki, a supposedly evil snake, was tricked into having the opportunity to be a god. he tells the boy that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles his lover is reincarnated and gives him a piece of junk jewelry. The store also reveals that despite its obvious whiteness, it is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, a dreamy reporter remembers him perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this girl at random. Cgi hijinks follows and in the last ten minutes my brain melts from my nose. Why? Continue, dear reader, if you have the Balls. <br /> <br /> so that Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having a better Asian friend and in the scene where she starts to go crazy and make a lot of posters with Asian characters in them, she tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what they are doing. It is a Korean legend and is reincarnated as a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that night, his dragon tattoo starts to hurt, he calls the police because he seems to be suffering from a heart attack. Look, in this crazy, crazy world, apparently they handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse says she's crazy. Now I have a new phobia, and that is that if I ever have problems, the first responders will assume that I am crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of discord with my hard lover, Dwar. There is a scene in which Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafe with a cheeky black friend. In the scenes before the divinity Miffed Near, Bauraki killed an elephant, slipped through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. Look, people were afraid to leave after it happened on September 11, but we should all harden after it was worth risking our lives for making a decision about coffee and cakes. As usual, there is no way for a giant snake to stop me from consuming caffeine. If I stay inside and I fear for my life, the terrorists and the serpentine deities win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying dragon in the helicopter battle, my cruel lover Dwar treats me with a scene full of vinegar and pi $$ to finish it off. Bauraki has a fortress of its own and is just below Los Angeles, I suppose. They do not really say it, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car accident that would kill minor men and when they wake up, yes, Dragon Palace. A bit of late dialogue later, a good dragon snake god appears out of nowhere and the snakes fight / make love whatever. And I'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I'm disproportionating, I'm not. There is no mention of this in the movie, suddenly ... there it is! A few seconds later, a good dragon becomes a dragon god, lights Baurki, Sarah becomes a ghost and leaves with the dragon god, the dream reporter stays in the middle of the credits from nothing ... thanks to God <br /> <br /> Now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy who looked like a turtle crusher and spoke exactly like a Star Wars tuskan mugger. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted when he wanted to, but it could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that was not useful. I could enter your dreams when that did not help and could set ten soldiers on fire at random, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like it because he hit a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan mugger noises. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors were great ... if somehow it meant terrible. Jason Behr, whom I thought was amazing in Roswell, gradually discovered that I can only act one way and that is pretentious, Spacey and Patrick Dempsey "ish". <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this disgusting prostitute is Dwars Her main actor, Bauraki. That giant snake acted his heart. I would dare to say that he was better at playing a demi-god of the bad CG serpentine than John Barrymore who was playing Richard III or Hamlet. There was excitement in each scene, stealing the thunder from its cast of lower mortal support. When he ate an elephant, I felt as if nobody, past or present, ate an elephant with so much feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this damn project. Yes, damn it, my favorite actor in this movie was a cgi snake. I have the balls to admit that, right? <br /> <br /> Here we have to wait for Bauraki to get more work and not be a cast of guys, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotions different from those of dreams, and that I will never have to see him again. Blue Monkey <br /> <br /> Then, D-War is over. I want to recover my CDs and be friends
