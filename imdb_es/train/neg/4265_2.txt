I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after seeing Mongol, which is absolutely amazing, and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations of a Sergei Bodrov film. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it was not like that, at least I expected a great epic battle at the end, but even that was a big disappointment, just a little run at random, waving the swords. ... There are so many good warrior movies, this is not one of them.
