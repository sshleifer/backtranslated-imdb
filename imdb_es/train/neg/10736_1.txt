The film begins quite with an intriguing scene, three people drink and chat in a bar. They are all inventing a little scandalous stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most scandalous story is the real one. However, beyond that, the film is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation passes barely half time in the film and, frankly, there is not much to see. The rest of the time, the director is delaying in a Russian town abandoned by God, full of lamentable and creepy old women. Of course, these images are fascinating and somewhat impressive, but admiring them lasts too long, sacrificing any possible argument or development of the character. I found this film as another example of a lousy or lazy creation of films, where, instead of trying to make an interesting story, the filmmakers concentrate on strangely fascinating images and some almost unrelated stories (example: the story of a merchant of meat) leave the viewer to find out all the odds and ends. On a surface it has an artistic appearance, but in this particular case it is just a lack of talent.
