Before this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous among fans of horror for his unforgettable performance of the man and boy Peter Bark, and the pleasant and sordid giallo Strip Nude For his killer None of the two films was a particularly spectacular piece of film, but both were entertaining in a special way (and the fact that they presented a lot of blood and nudes did not hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite a bit of splash and the strange place of free naked flesh. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film reside during filming, is confusing and boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin does not shows, the movie is a real struggle to sit down (it cost me four tries). Finish), with endless scenes of disagreeable characters arguing among themselves and making very little note. <br /> <br /> The film's only point of interest is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to wage his mega bloody film Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen that movie, then there's very little reason to bother Massacre.
