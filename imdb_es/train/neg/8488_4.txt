Encompassing virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the constant struggle to express their identity in a restrictive society and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace played by the fascinating Tilda Swinton, this film should have been excellent. But it's horrible, terrible if you consider the potential! The performance, apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black, goes from being tolerable to atrocious. The construction of the plot is awkward to say the least: the modern-day programmer is a boring one-note character, but half of the film is invested in setting up her character, and then, when Ada finally shows up, it's for narrate the events of his life. Do not present an attractive story (although Swinton almost accomplished this). You never know her completely as a real person, just an icon of a graduate student's story article. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, like a digital dog and bird, are dismal and distracting, considering it was 1997 and not 1985. And, finally, the script is just bad. Bad dialogues, often pretentious, especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me writhe: cold and distant characters, and no attempt to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Amazing! But it does not seem to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Although we are not given any clue, then or later, why it could be dangerous, and it never seems to be really dangerous). <br /> <br /> In addition, despite being computers, Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, it is clear that none of the people involved with the script had knowledge of math or computers, any reference to these topics would be It presents as a complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> A scene, towards the end of The movie is pretty good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness for the fragility of life, but her joy in that life. It is poignant, passionate and insightful, seems to have detached from another movie. <br /> <br /> So I am disappointed with this movie, because it is a missed opportunity for a small and fascinating cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may want to rent it, but be careful. See Orlando for another much better examination of the gender roles in history with a great performance by Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of In the movie, Ada asks that her memories not be preserved (in what I thought was the best scene of the movie). But then the modern programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories to his little girl (hence the title of the movie). Am I right, that the programmer violated Ada's wishes without even fighting for it? Or is this another point of confusing plot that I am misinterpreting?
