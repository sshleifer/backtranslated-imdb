In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as seems possible. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of the life of man but clearly fictitious, does not even touch the surface, and is still a very mature story for a modern retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, plays London, and his performance is both robust and sympathetic. He is not the problem here. Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "base" for this film. The life of London here has been divided into a series of episodes, which the film jumps lightly. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold seeker in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese war ... colorful events, no doubt, but almost no It gives them nothing like depth treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santell (who also directed one of Susan's early films, "Our Leading Citizen", in 1939) is indifferent at best. To make things more difficult here is a DVD of very poor quality, with an unpleasant-looking print source and a sibilant sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the extras on the DVD: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, with hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Hopefully these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
