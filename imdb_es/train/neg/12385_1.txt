This movie is so ridiculously idiotic that you can really laugh at it. But no, even this is too much for these lost meters of celluloid. I found it as an offer in a magazine and that's why I've seen it. I'm sorry for the time I lost to see this. 1 out of 10 (because they do not have a lower rating).
