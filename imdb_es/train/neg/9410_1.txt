While you can suffer it! If you like to see people wake up, get up, get dressed, bathe, prepare dinner, look at each other, have sex in the dark and then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like sticky floors, rooms close and kitchens, long minutes of silence ... if you like to get bored for two hours, feeling the emotion of "true intimate false art", then you will like it. But if you do not do it, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "While you're here," but do we want to stay? This German film received the prize of the Torino gay film festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, since the festival presented many talented films. Maybe being nice to a German, as they often do not get rewards? Well, "The Lives of Others" did it ... but this one is excellent but it's not gay. So maybe it's a matter of fashion. Are the Germans "in" again? It does not matter that? Or maybe just for the eyes of some directors?
