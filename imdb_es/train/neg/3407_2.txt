Okay, forget all the technical inconsistencies or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle being thrown accidentally by a peculiar robot with a heart of gold. Forget the horrible special effects and one-dimensional characters poorly constructed. Just looking at the premise of the story. The very reason why the movie existed in the first place, and you will see how bad this film was put together. <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-old children look at this insult to intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message he tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse, is that the cable movie channels KEEP IT SHOWING! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, let alone see it? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is that I do not bother to spend the energy to see this thing. Not worth it.
