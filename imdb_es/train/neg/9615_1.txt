It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not. He not only left the plot, but he also invented his. The things he chose to leave were so incredibly incredible that I was glad that he chose to set aside some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was confusing, inconsistent and choppy, to say the least. I do not want to say anything bad about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber was no more than a Kramer of the mid-nineteenth century, and the less said about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, look at the wonderful adaptation of the 1999 BBC. As for the screenwriter, I think he read the Cliff Notes!
