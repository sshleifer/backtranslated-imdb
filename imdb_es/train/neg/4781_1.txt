This could be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study the German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even a clumsy leader in the Soviet style as a fatherly divine figure was better off. Disappointing. The loss of faith, recovered in the church at the last second just in time for Dad to be "saved" by the Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, he seemed hurried and not melodramatic enough. A few celestial and misty shots of the angelical Hoover in the corner of the screen radiating and nodding, would have added much. The best aspect is that Hoover only saves the family and children who deserve it. The WHO has "proven" its worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people were represented as nice and even good, but Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have been taking them drinking spirits to prove the justice of their condition. Finally, the bright and happy scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from depression) had to be shot at the end. Then we could see how Hoover-God had saved not only this deserving family, but all that really deserved it. Amateurist at best.
