The first notable problem with this film, clumsily titled, is its casting. Ann Nelson plays grandma here. Three years after this, she would star in "Plane!" like the woman who hangs up while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is fifteen years old and has problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the hell is going on with this family. First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and her grandfather bought an RV, cheap, and took it to all the tourist traps in the California desert. The RV soon has a mind of its own, leaving the road and such. Then, big rocks begin to throw themselves at her. The elderly couple is afraid, but remains in the vehicle to move the plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, Grandpa suffers a heart attack after being stranded on the roof of the recreational vehicle when he leaves for another unplanned trip. <br /> <br /> The Boston mom starts talking to some Native American mommies she has in the house. She imagines herself as the author and makes abundant notes on the moldy corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother semi-turning around, but her mental crisis occurs off the screen, like Gramps's heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the endurance patient, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own story. He thinks that mom is fighting (this was done in 1977). Apparently, mom is making the astral bodies of Native American mummies fly through the air. One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt starts acting like a madman. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes the grandmother and Matt to the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now, and the trio faces the invisible (and inexplicable) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of building the scene. The only professional here involves the RV stranded on a saline in the desert. In the distance, the couple notice some stones rolling towards the RV. This is a pretty spooky little scene that eventually gets overestimated. As the rocks begin to jump towards the vehicle, the special effects become obvious. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the RV leaves the highway, then turn on again, become eternal. The scenes in which the grandfather is trapped on the roof of the mobile home while traveling on a dirt road last forever. Mummy's conversations with the mummy take an eternity. Matt's out-of-body experiences take an eternity. This movie lasts an eternity. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press the fast-forward button at least a dozen times. As the scenes progressed, it was obvious that Flocker was padded. Cut the fat here, and this would have arrived in an hour. The final "explanation", that the spirits of the mummies were trying to kill those who are close to Matt, never has water. Did they inhabit the RV? The filmmaker never mentions the fact that spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they never kill anyone! <br /> <br /> While thinking about Nelson in "Airplane!", I also thought about other movies. . Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this. Boston is terrible like the child, playing a fifteen-year-old boy like a cute ten-year-old who has a smart line for all these adults who fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flocker has written and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise for the public to feel uncomfortable. This is not scary, and like ghosts, you can also walk ... away from this tape in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is not qualified, and contains some physical violence and blasphemy.
