Hi. I'm Paul Raddick, a.k.a. WTAF panic attack, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this horrible movie of God that drove Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized shortly after. <br /> <br /> Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship. and it fails ... or so I thought. Sandler meets babies who like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babies were supposed to be engaged, but, in reality, they are executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler did poorly on Going Overboard, but he did better on Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was a hot girl. Spanglish is red hot, going overboard is not a Dooley squat! End of document.
