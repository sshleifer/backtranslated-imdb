I noticed that "Fire" was on the wire the other night and I started seeing it because I could not remember anything specific about it, other than that it was a horrible movie when I saw it in '85. Twenty years later, the movie is still horrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Listening to that song again made me want to prick a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted on them. And to compose this musical assault, the character of Rob Lowe played the saxophone, and there was a scene in which he played a solo that went on and on as if it were Charlie Parker, only his high-pitched tone and his performance more reminiscent of a monkey that played a kazoo All the characters were intensely unpleasant, although I must say they did a great job of selecting equally unpleasant actors to portray them. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was attractive, and at first I felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but almost at the end of the movie she decides to have sex with the character of Rob Lowe's, who would probably be voted with a higher probability of transferring a variety. of sexual diseases if such a thing were voted on.
