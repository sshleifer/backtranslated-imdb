I just saw it, me and my upper half could not believe how horrible and badly acted it was. If someone else thinks it's good, then you should be happy easily. In fact, I gave up one night to see this, everything has been done before. THAT IS TO SAY. The hostel comes to mind, but at least that did not make you tremble because of the bad performance and the lack of story lines, the same old things, re-incubated, I read a lot about this movie, I even recommended it to my classmates, my Guilt, someone said it was good! There is no more gory, horror or wobbling in disgust than your average "scary movie", it must be said, do not bother with this movie. get mary poppins. Now that's scary! I'm leaving now, I'm going to the movies and I see something more terrifying than this, maybe, little sunny lady
