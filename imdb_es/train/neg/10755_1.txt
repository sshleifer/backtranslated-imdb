I really can not think of any redeeming feature of this totally bad performance in Asimov than the artistic direction. Forget the disaster of product placement, Will Smith's unconvincing performance and the huge holes in the plot. This was not only ridiculous and painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mix of production values ​​inspired by MTV and an absolutely bad dialogue probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> Too bad science fiction can be so bad it can still be done after we have Bladerunner, Minority Report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs to the list of the last 100. Really horrible
