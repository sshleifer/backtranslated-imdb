I just rented (yes! I paid money to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. As another critic said, Mrs. Colagrande, leave the movies, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a melon. No, that's not fair to the melon, which probably has more in its favor. She does not know how to act; It affects a look of disgust ALL the time (it reminded me a lot of my young sisters-in-law always disgusted with Europe). She is not charming; she is not pretty There is no real story. And the edition! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty bad when you're watching a movie and, just to get over it, you press "forward" on your remote control, and STILL nothing happens! I mean! ..... I continued screaming involuntarily, "Cut! Cut!" What were you thinking? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a movie together and they PAYED to make love on the screen! Pretty good deal for THEM; I try quite raw for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw up now ...
