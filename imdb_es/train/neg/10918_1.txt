Manmohan Desai made some entertaining, though illogical, films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made some dice like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies he has ever made, the dial He became famous. Mard ko dard nahin hota but the movie is so bad that you shudder <br /> <br /> The British do carricatures and the movie looks so strange The scene in the British hotel is very stupid <br /> <br / > The movie has many stupidities like Amrita attacking Amitabh and then the whole scene, more towards the climax, the movie becomes even worse. There are more gems like the statue of a horse that comes alive, Amitabh masks, haha ​​and more. <br /> <br /> Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad. The music is good. <br /> <br /> Amitabh does her part with style, nothing different from COOLIE, LAAWARIS type papers. Amrita Singh is fine. Satyen Kapuu is fine. Prem Chopra is as always, Nirupa Roy is again his habit. Dara Singh car is also as usual
