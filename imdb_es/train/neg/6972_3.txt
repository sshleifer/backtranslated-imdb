When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant insect that chased some nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey", I knew it was not in any great Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese-ball movie, which always does a good job in whatever role he assumes ... The FX are pretty cheesy, there's not too much plot, and I'm still not sure why this movie it's called Blue Monkey, because there's nothing in this movie to do with Monkey. But come on, people, what did you expect? It's not really as bad as it seems ... If you enjoy the old black and white bugs attack movies in the style of the 50s, this is basically an updated version, without the special FX updates.
