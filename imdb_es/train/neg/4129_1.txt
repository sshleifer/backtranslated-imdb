After seeing about half of this, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I held it until the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is bad, much worse than the performance in the T & A movies of the 80s. <br /> <br /> There are several humorous attempts that fail miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Maybe if you are a teenager, this movie will have some appeal, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the movie will look after the first 10 minutes. The rest of his time will pass in agony waiting for the final credits to come out. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
