Often there are mismatched couples (in the general sense of the term) in Huston's films: "The African Queen" "Heaven knows Mister Allison", "The roots of Heaven" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (see the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things were fashionable at that time, as "Sayonara", the "world of Suzie Wong" and "the tea house of the August moon" are witnesses. Huston's effort could be the worst of this pretty bad lot (with the exception of "Susie", maybe). John Wayne fits perfectly into Ford's world, in Huston he's like a bull in a china shop. Your Japanese partner is totally insipid. Even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those completely in love with every Huston job should choose this, among all their other great movies.
