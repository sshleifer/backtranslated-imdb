Andy Lau stars in another secret police tale. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for the police and is also near the top of a gang of drug dealers (Lau). The film begins when we see the police try to make a drug raid just to see how it is smashed to pieces. Then we are introduced to the young mother addicted to drugs and her daughter who lives near Nick, his friends and police, and in 45 minutes I turn off the movie and put the news. Well acted and great to see this is a movie as unfashionable as I've seen in a long time. It's not bad as such, you just do not care. I mean, I really did not care at all. In fact, I started doing something else, completely forgetting that I had a subtitled movie, that's what I did not care about. I wish I had hated the movie, but the movie is so non-existent that it almost did not impress me (it's something I could not even sleep, but something to ignore). We go to the box called the Chinese Scarface, what after he died? This is one to avoid.
