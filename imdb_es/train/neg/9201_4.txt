This is the movie that personifies the fear D & D of the 80 (and even today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other role play) will be "dragged" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill partying, sacrifices of children, suicides, etc.). Great movie for anyone who wants to blame the problems of society for inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a role-playing game, a video game or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It's for D & D what Wargames was for computers. Also, like a movie, it's just a bit horrible.
