This has to be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrendous, the performance was b-movie and the effects were simply rated by Nintendo 64. You would think that they would put a little more effort into it. Of course, it's a Scifi channel movie, so you should expect it to be low speed, but this one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. Therefore, like a movie of shaking your head in disbelief, this is going well. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have some 'well-known' actors and actresses in this, it is hard for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this film was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics could have been good in the 60s or even in the early 70s, but come on, this is 2009! I will not give spoilers, let's say that if you've played "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64, you'll be very familiar with what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
