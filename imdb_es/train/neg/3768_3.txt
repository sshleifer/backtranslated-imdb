It's okay. A film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better, having worked the sets of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'). <br /> <br /> Therefore, the plot. There are some scientists, and some forest rangers, and a hot girl with huge fake breasts. Everyone is very bad at work, including the hot girl (who I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the ranger comments that the scientists are "professionals", which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional larvae or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They are walking through the forest in search of some strange ape-like bones, and no one mentions once that the bones could be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just roam and one of the ranger hits the hottie without qualms. We all expect her to die very soon (along with her sister, who is destined to be naive and adorable, but who is really just annoying). Then they, * pant *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, an animal burial resembling a monkey. Of course, it's not mentioned that it could be just Bigfoot bones that they're with ... I think scientists and rangers just do not think about that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe get very angry and kill all the people we dislike, drives away the other losers and buries his great-aunt Muriel and his cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident ) again. <br /> <br /> Insipid and boring dialogue (Zon√© several times), inane plot, unpleasant characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that was not very good, everything adds up to make a movie that I will not see again. <br /> <br /> You check it though; It's good for some involuntary laughter.
