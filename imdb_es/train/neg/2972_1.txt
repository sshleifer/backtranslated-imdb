My teacher recorded this and showed it to us in Child Care to show how teen pregnancy affects people. It simply showed how teenage pregnancy affects a child athlete who is not properly educated about how sex works and a whiny, loveless girl who throws fruit when she is angry and could not say she was with the wrong man, even if she was a sign that said it was. I would not be surprised if the baby's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (the baby carrier) is a riot. She does not realize the fact that her daughter is more than four years old and does not seem to move when people spy her through the window of her dining room. The name of Bobby's best friend (the father) is Dewey, and it's an obvious scam of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thank God, it is only made for television, which limits the possibilities for the public to see it.
