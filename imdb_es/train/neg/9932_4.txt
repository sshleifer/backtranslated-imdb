Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent B movie actor who made many noirs similar to the 1940s, can not do much with this: a young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; When he is sentenced to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with the help of the husband of the dead woman. After a dazzling opening shot, the fast movement is installed in the formula of film B. Without doubt, it looks good, but the twisted finish is handled without color and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a little rigid. Based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich, and passable for a single visualization. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
