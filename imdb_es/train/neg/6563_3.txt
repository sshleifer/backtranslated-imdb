Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to go on vacation to Florida. Where he meets a small penquin, trying to save an Eskimo. This short attempt and the penquin is adorable, but in the end it is a bit too light in the department of laughter. The Eskimo is not really that great for Bugs and, frankly, I've seen Bugs Bunny cartoons a lot better, even other short ones when combined with other unknown antagonists. So I can not in good conscience recommend this. However, it is good to see it in its uncut form. This cartoon is on Disc 3 of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My rating: C
