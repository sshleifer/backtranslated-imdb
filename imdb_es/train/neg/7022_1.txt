In more than 70 years of watching movies, this has to be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and some others have done some very bad comedies, however, this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It's not funny from the opening to the tack in scene during the credits. . <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, who I usually like, must have needed her paycheck. She desperately needs to relearn her trade. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is), needs a better director, to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not live up to her role either. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find another character, he has done this same type of person many times. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard who began years ago as a first-rate actor, and is not as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> There's nothing decent I can say about this cinematic comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
