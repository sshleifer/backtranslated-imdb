This entrance of Drummond lacks continuity. Most of them have their elements of nonsense, the postponed wedding, etc. However, this has an endless series of events that occur in the dark when the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is such an obvious suspect that no one seems to even look. He is a stranger and acts quite suspicious, but Drummond and the people do not seem to notice anything. Still, as a reasonably good action and a pretty good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies, he's so stupid that it's hard to imagine that someone with taste or intelligence is close to the. Is there a story behind it that explains how he and Drummond partnered?
