This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The Script is bad !!! I guess they just copied and pasted the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers must have thought that we are going to create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They were not successful. Now, in the third week, it's only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 10:45 or something like that. In the past we have had very good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shadows are a waste of time. Maybe he could sneak into the theater after having seen a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of shadows, you've seen it all. It was announced to death on local radio and television. I hope it disappears in the shadows soon.
