I refer to watching bad films frequently, and the original movies of the science fiction channel tend to be one of the best sources of these films you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Arenas del olvido. The performance was unusually sub-par, unlike the unfortunately shameful screen that science fiction usually has in store for us. There are some cameos made by people that you are very likely to recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. CGI special effects are minimal and, as such, one of the greatest sources of comedy in a science fiction feature is missing. Sure, there are some funny moments like when a boy is beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend in death to save a girl who is known for a couple of days, but in general, he just does not have one. rolling on the floor with laughter, and I consider it a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rated it on a 10-star scale made specifically to judge television movies, I would probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I have to wait until the next movie of original science fiction to laugh at me, and I really hope that this movie is not part of a general quality increase in science. -Fi original movies.
