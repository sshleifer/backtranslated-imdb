This is a very soft and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant works. I can only guess that the intention was to make the game as accessible and comprehensible as possible to an audience that had not previously been exposed to Shakespeare. In doing so, however, by leaving each line clear and each attempt obvious, they have exhausted the game of life and have turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow, it's really boring, a very difficult feat given such a wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The performance is, at best, forgettable: Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, are not doing so well. The hero of April Shawnham is a shaved and breathless head that often provokes gestures. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a meaningless cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash (although Snidley was much nicer). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) is not in this version, unless he was disguised and his name was removed from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a god of theater, this production is not only disappointing but also scratches his head. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this. See Mucho Ado from Branagh instead - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful performances.
