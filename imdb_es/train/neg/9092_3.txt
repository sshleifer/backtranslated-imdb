'Speedy Gonzalez' by Friz Freleng was the second caricature to present the title character after Robert McKimson's 'Cat-tails for Two'. In that caricature, Speedy has been a small and ugly creature with a large gold tooth, but in his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite being significantly more handsome, Speedy never became a great character. A big hat, a tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character and that's almost everything Speedy had for him. However, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and starred in many short films, including some really abysmal films from the last days of the studio. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later atrocities in which he was frequently paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags based generally on a similar pursuit formula. In this homonymous episode, Speedy is recruited by other mice to steal the cheese from the local factory, which is protected by the cat Sylvester. Although he brings the extra weight of a star spin to the caricature, Sylvester's role here could easily be filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is diminished by being forced to the predictable. Undemanding role of persecutor. This was also always a problem in Tweety's cartoons, but Speedy becomes an even more boring adversary thanks to his detestable arrogance and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor Sylvester would be forced to appear with Speedy for many years. Although it follows a fairly basic formula and presents minimal laughs, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a star was born that was not worth it.
