Before seeing this, I had seen some pretty bad Christmas movies. But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather." "Santa Claus" is a happy movie about Santa helping some children, but he almost feels demonic when he sees her. Santa Jolly Ho-Ho-Ho is replaced by an evil and devilish laugh that I am sure has made many children not at Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits with all the performances and dialogues. Santa Claus lives above theratos on the North Pole, where infecci√≥n and the children of the whole world prepare for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy called Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa Claus's Christmas by making three children naughty, and creating amusements, such as moving the fireplace and making the doorknob hot. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it depends on Santa's assistant, Pedro and the magician Merlin, to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything related to this film, besides being downright bad, is very strange. Satan dances a lot and actually seems much happier than Santa. Santa talks about giving gifts to all the children, but it seems that he only delivers to 5 children's homes in Mexico. Reindeer are rope toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm surprised it does not fill the children's eyes ... it's terrifying. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa Claus playing the organ while the children sing to him. Probably one of the strangest scenes is that Santa shoots Pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and laughs out loud while Pitch dances in pain. I think it's better for parents to tell their young children where the babies are coming from, than to show them this. The only positive thing is that it will make you laugh hysterically if you can appreciate the bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: PUMP / ****. 85 minutes
