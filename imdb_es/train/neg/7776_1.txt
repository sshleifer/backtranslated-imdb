What a load of garbage ... I can not even begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The qualification you have here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first snapshots of ginger. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed ... a brilliant film with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was 'alrite', decent as an independent film, but clearly not at the level of the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I rate the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it's actually set in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some half-American Native mythology. The sisters do not have a real story, nor a progression, not even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and be "together forever." That is as deep as you can. <br /> <br /> I was amazed that the girls agreed to be in this pile of shit, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing, on stage The action was terrible: people appeared out of nowhere regularly, as the girls turn around and there is an elaborate configuration by candlelight with a mystique Native American sitting there, about to speak. The sets were terrible, they could not avoid the fact that everything was obviously based on a set, which really did not help. Also, there was always snow outside the camp, but there was no sign inside (... on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh, so bad! I really expected it to be at least as good as the second.
