This movie was just painful to watch ... not in the good dramatic way that makes you tremble with emotions for the well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I practically made that last sentence as it progressed), but only in a boring way absolute for more than two hours. Now, all of you may think that I am just an ignorant critic who has no respect for Shakespeare or the "artistic creation of films" ... well, he would be wrong in both aspects. I love Shakespeare's plays, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I've seen many "auteur films," like the surrealist and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. ... but this was a little over two hours of Shakespeare's lost translation, A LOT of nudity (I can understand the artistic nudity in SOME scenes ... but not in all the other shots of a movie! NOTHING FOR HISTORY! ), And, basically, just a fervent movie. I had high expectations for this film as it was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was only an extreme disappointment. I gave this movie a THREE ONLY due to Sir John Gielgud's acting presence (which far surpassed all the names in this film) and the combination of cinematography / set design, as it made many scenes look like moving paintings. .. however, a large part of this film would have been better as ONLY a painting with a text scroll underneath. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli had been given the director's chair, this would have been much better. But this is the opinion of a member of the audience, many others can enjoy this much more than me. That said, if you can not find this at any nearby video store (it's not currently on DVD), do not try to go too far to find it ... it's really not worth it.
