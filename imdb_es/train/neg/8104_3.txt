Yes, I know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of "depth" (political turmoil, love / lust) can be combined at random with great critical acclaim (see also "American beauty"). The works of Kaufman's film along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialogue sequences (in a scene I counted on three different "generic European" accents affected by the actors) and state demonstrations could work like crazy, but not They manage to link them with the coherent meditation Kundera offers. and in its three hours longer, almost completely overlooks Franz, the fourth missing piece in the love triangle at the heart of the plot, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel to show the spectrum of emotions and the power relationships that are obtained in love affairs. Nor does it even include the token screen time for Tomas's son, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points that Kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overloaded soundtrack, these failures make the three hours of this movie have an unbearable weight tone and a light content.
