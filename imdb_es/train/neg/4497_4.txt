- I had planned to write something explaining what I did not like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can not remember much about it. I saw it only three days ago and it almost did not impress me. That is usually the sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember is that I was bored incredibly most. The novelty of having an aspect of Humphrey Bogart as the detective disappeared very quickly. It would be different if he could act, but he is a one-note artist. The scenes of killing were handled in an amateur way and there was no suspense that led to them. If you can not see the killer five minutes after the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. Casting is a dead gift to the murderer's identity.
