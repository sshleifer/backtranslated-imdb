CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost all the movies that I choose to see in the theater are, at least, entertaining or have something to say. This movie looked like it was directed by a film student for his Introduction. to the film class. His father makes great movies. Your sister made a good one. But Roman brother? DO NOT! One critic had the audacity to compare this film with Le MÃ©pris (Contempt) by Godard. While Coppola, Jr. took the same idea, a movie about the film, tried too much to look European, artistic and witty, when everything is really kitsch. The main actor transmits the same expression throughout the entire film, as if he was amazed or shocked by this movie that was made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to fulfill his role as an extravagant director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that has a true parody of movie humor is, surprisingly, not the B movie scenes, but one that takes place in Italy; A montage of shots of several different characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and leaving people at random. This was the only thing that reminded me of the movies that I guess I was trying to cheat. Or a scam. Or both The documentary with the protagonist talking through the camera and filming several objects has been reproduced, the end was labeled for the sake of a "turn" or artistic value ... I guess the most funny part of this movie was the film itself, And not in the way he intended. No wonder that this film was sent back after a screening of the festival to be reissued or re-shot or whatever, which makes me curious about how bad it was before. I can not believe it was worse than this. If you want to see a good parody of the movie, check out the Austin Powers movies. Any of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and cooler than this whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the cinema's sake, PLEASE, re-direct your cousin's music videos. Leave the godparents to daddy.
