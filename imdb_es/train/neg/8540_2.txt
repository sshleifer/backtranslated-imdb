As someone else mentioned, it starts with a strange prologue about a blonde girl who kills a cat. Then, the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and travel to the mountains. First, they spend the night in an inn where Gaffari shouts, with growing irritation to the public, that the owner is deaf. Once in the mountains, they seek refuge again and are invited by a kind old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (someone, Hansel and Gretel?) What will happen next? I'll leave it for the audacious spectator to solve because he probably could not. Now, I like Eurohorror, and this would have been better if only Artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt to tell a logical story. The backdrop (the Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and hidden events. Green peaks could easily obscure the supernatural forces and those who command them. The photography is beautiful. I just want everything to make sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
