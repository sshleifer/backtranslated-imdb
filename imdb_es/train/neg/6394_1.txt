This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The performance was bad. The scenario was not realistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in eons will appear one night. Most of the world population decided to see this comet. Then, the next morning, all but a select few have become dust due to the comet's radiation. The clothes of the people are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but the people became dust. There are no bones, nothing. That's ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people and leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet transformed some people into monsters that eat zombie flesh. Her makeup would not have even seemed terrifying to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more ... and they're supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were saved from death and the zombie. How can steel block radiation from a comet that supposedly incinerates people in its tracks? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting is the horror music of the 60s that plays in the background through parts of the movie, or 80s rock that is useless. The movie and it makes you want to record your television. <br /> <br /> However, the stupidest part of the film is the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unreal. Who would go to loot the day after an apocalypse with mutants who eat meat running around? There were four 5-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes there is an unsophisticated dialogue that makes South Park look smart. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. I do not see this movie, ever.
