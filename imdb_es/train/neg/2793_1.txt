This is high on my list of the worst movies I've seen so far on Starz on Demand. It seems that they collect all the direct DVDs to DVD that they can find and put them here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, anyone with a digital camera and a limited budget can create a horror movie and put it on television. To be honest, I thought it was terrible from the moment I saw the trailer, but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind regarding low budget movies. Some of the best movies I've seen were movies that fit their low budget or, in other cases, only required that low budget was excellent. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You know the plot, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you heard it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. It is a pathetic and weeping girl that we know during the 3 minutes in an incredibly bad music video of "heavy metal". Whoever put it must have thought that it looked really interesting, but it really does not. Anyway, she commits suicide. Then she owns someone. Then some killing begins. It's really memorable and as normal and boring as possible. When the first shot is fired in your apartment, it sounds pretty seriously like a piece of popcorn. Was that the best sound effect they could get? You could find a better sound effect to use for free (without copyrights) on the Internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Do not let the other critics who claim that this is a 10-star movie fool you. Obviously, they are distributors of the film or maybe even the director who tries to convince him to think that it is worth buying this piece of scrap metal. <br /> <br /> Laughable.
