I have read the other comment about this movie, and I usually try not to be hard on my criticism because I try to be a good person. However, this movie is one of the worst I've seen in my life (and that surpasses many bad nights of the US Network More Cinemax). Whoever has thought of this movie should avoid having another. This movie disgusted me in a way that no other movie ever did. I really believe that these people are crazy. Just save time and do not look at this fllm. Please - I wish I had. The acting is horrible, the plot (what plot) is STUPID and degrading and demented. I really do not think this should have turned into a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.
