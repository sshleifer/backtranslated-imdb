Where to start? Special effects should be called special defects. When the director shouted "action", I suppose he also told the actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Maybe he was upset with the producers and wanted to make sure they would not recover a single penny from their investment and that the job would be a case study on how not to make movies. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family did not let him. <br /> <br /> The only sure thing that whoever uses it in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and eliminated all previous references.
