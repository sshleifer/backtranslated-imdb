It seems that the United States is directing the police of the United Kingdom, who run armed to the teeth and knew that the CID agents wear uniforms when they stop working and go to the pub! This has to be one of the most unreal movies with the worst representation of the "real" police in the UK that has never been imposed on an unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr. Snipes may have needed the money to pay his back taxes, but what the hell is a good actor like Charles Dance doing is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst low budget "B" movie of the 50s. An hour and a half of suicide and time will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the real plague.
