This movie was so disappointing. For the propaganda that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called that?), I had expected something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful images. I had some interesting images, but they often seemed random and made no sense. In fact, they seemed as if they were inserted to complete the time. In the end, the effect was indifferent. <br /> <br /> I think the movie should be atmospheric, but it was not. The lack of a coherent plot did not help. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was incoherent without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed disturbed, but the plan did not attract me enough to worry about his situation. Without looking at the list of actors, I would not have known that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for the time, place or character. I'm not rude, but the sex scenes (there were several) seemed useless and confused me even more. I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or if she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered that the furry back was destined to belong to her lover. This movie managed to make what should have been shocking (the sequences of dreams involving Lulu's mother) seem a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the nails really made more sense, as it gave some indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors, since they did not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious. but the final result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not bother talking about it anymore.
