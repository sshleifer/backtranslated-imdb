I had never heard of this before it appeared on cable television. It is very typical of the science fiction of the late 50's: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is presented in a documentary style, which is perhaps a cheap way to leave a large part of the narrative exposure and an excuse to insert as much archival material as possible. Humanly possible. So it is unmistakably a low budget company! Although it does not lack self-interest (the angle of missile-apocalypse-renegade was used later, with much greater aplomb, both for DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and fortunately brief, the unique focus of the film The results of this theme are a lot of unintentional laughter, especially in scenes involving an imminent birth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents.
