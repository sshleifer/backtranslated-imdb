This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar to ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! Supposedly it was a tribute, according to the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however, "swindle" is the most appropriate word. The film felt as if it had been snatched directly from Kubrick's classic, only filmed through the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when he stops his massacre of Kubrick's work, the movie gets even worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this movie is simply pushed by your throat. Arrogant, absorbed in himself and, finally, without sense, without sense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the ramblings of the protagonists would touch a nerve if there was a real development of the character in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this boy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I guess if someone could feel something for him, it would be me. Development of characters, dialogues and incredible arguments. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie called "16 years of alcohol", alcoholism is not a factor in the movie. See the first paragraph: it was a butcher shop of A Clockwork Orange that I can not beat. A more appropriate title would have been "16 years of violence" or, better yet, "A mechanical banana." <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it out anyway, drink. Trust me.
