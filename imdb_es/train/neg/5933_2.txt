I've been a fan since his first album. This movie is a disservice to him. The performances, except one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Those of Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even that of the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I had never seen my wife get up and leave the room in a movie before and I found myself fast. Forwarding through the performances to reach the few segments of interviews, which were also difficult to see due to the bad work of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many who have been able to interpret the songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson come to mind, but the people selected for this presentation were just horrible . <br /> <br /> Hopefully, there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in a film that will illustrate his perception, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> Very sad
