This is a movie that shows that mood, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer can enjoy many fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties: I especially liked the view of the tram approaching the tunnel and the tram that goes up the slope, but in a sense this good picture is counterproductive. , because it creates a state of mind that "something is going to happen", and nothing happens. The script also stays true to some plot or action or trauma, and again and again it is not delivered. Not even delivering the subject (I suppose) of the film, the essential maladjustment of the characters. The main actors, too nice for their roles, did not transmit any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? That's another history. His character was so well formed, so perfectly interpreted, that he wanted the camera to follow him.
