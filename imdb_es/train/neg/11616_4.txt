I did not like the movie, Joshua, at all. Maybe it's because I saw another similar movie much better titled Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's because this movie was not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original, but that does not mean that the film has not been successful. It could have been entertaining, entertaining and chilling, but instead it was slow to build, boring, without incident and it really did not leave me thinking more than "that was not very good" when it was over. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I'm not going to reveal that, but the reality is that he really did not achieve his goals, because even though Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappeared around 3/4 of the movie, all arrows point to his return home soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind, but then the father of Joshua / Her husband was accused of manipulating her medication, which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was not really mentally ill , but I was receiving a medical dose. So ... should not she go home soon? Has not Joshua failed? Will not his mother live with him, his sister and possibly his father soon? I question the Father since his future is open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. The diabolical demon demon Joshua was not really terrifying. The plot moved slowly and when it was resumed it was still boring. The suspense fell flat each time. When it was over, I could not believe that I had sat through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the performance was good from the parents, especially from Vera Farmiga as the Mother, but if you want to see a movie about an evil "child", go see Hu√©rfano. Now that is a film that took a non-original concept and created a brilliant movie.
