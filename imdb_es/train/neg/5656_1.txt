Ziab ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is just an overlay of scenes without a clear link. Acting is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El Allayli. But something really surprising in this film, talking about sexuality, emancipation of women, nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema, even these days. I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote this movie as horrible are not only the stage and the performance, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur movie. We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arab movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to promote uncensored movies throughout the Arab world, see them and have your friends and family do the same.
