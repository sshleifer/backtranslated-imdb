The childhood comedy of the same title by Michael Keaton in 1998 was flatly condemned for its shoddy special effects, but, compared to what Screaming Mad George prepared for this horror comedy, they are absolutely mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven gloves. What they probably were. The cast puts it thick in this parody of dozens of other movies (much worse) and Paul Keith, as a city doctor, is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
