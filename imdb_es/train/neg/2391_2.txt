I love movies I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those that have unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I like foreign films as much as English ones. I love good movies and even bad ones, because almost no film fails to entertain or entertain at some level. Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I attended a nighttime performance of "Cowgirls", I joined an audience of around 10. At less than half, I just stayed. Soon I could not even tolerate the unsettling disorder that was unfolding before my eyes, and I also left. To this day, "Cowgirls" is still the only movie I've come out of. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to describe this incoherent, empty, garbage, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its lack of redemptive value. Suffice it to say that it ranks as one of the worst movies of all time, absurd and inexcusable at all levels. She tries to be intelligent, but her conception of feminism seems irremediably anachronistic. Try to be fun, but his humor is coarse and worthy to shrink. This is one of the few films that manages to desecrate his own spirit, by representing the protagonists in such an unpleasant way that he rebels against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, look at "Waterworld", "Ishtar", anything but this. Except for the new "Alexander". If you are choosing between that and this, read a book instead.
