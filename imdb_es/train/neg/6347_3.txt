It is likely that he will always go to see a Woody Alleb movie, since one never knows when he could make a true return to his past greatness. Only one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, however, this movie simply does not reach any point. To say that it really makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is very similar to that of many other Woody fans, but what can I say? It's probably time for you to concentrate on your Clarinett, which, in my opinion, is pretty good. By saying all this, I will probably continue with any new movie that Woody may publish in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect The WOODY !!
