I would not bring a child under 8 years old to see this. With the puppies hanging from the buildings twisting between dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's terrifying laugh to mention some of the events, there is too much suspense for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more ominous feeling than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disturbing moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, many tense moments that worry and can scare the little ones. children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Disney people thought, but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level. The puppies are cute But this movie is irregular at best.
