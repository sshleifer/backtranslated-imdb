'Flight Of Fury' is an amazingly serious action movie, but worst of all boring. I do not expect much from a Seagal movie, all I hope is that I am entertained moderately for 90 minutes or so with some senseless action. Unfortunately, this does not happen. Do not even achieve that low expectation. The action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with huge plot holes all over the place. The acting is really abysmal, almost confusing to Seagal and his whisper The performance of One expression is the best among the unfortunate lot of the third evaluators: I can hardly believe that it has spent about $ 12M in this serious disaster unless $ 11M of those 12 is the Salary of Seagal: somehow I doubt it! The only time of interest for heterosexual men or homosexual girls is that, seemingly out of nowhere, two hot girls end up in a scene of lesbian sex complete with huge gaps on display other than that. It is something mediocre that is not different for many of them. the B films of Michael Dudikoff that I have endured <br /> <br /> 1/10
