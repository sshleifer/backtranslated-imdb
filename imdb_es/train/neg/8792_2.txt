This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories in a single movie. Obviously, other reviewers have also learned it because there are several mentions of the "first part" and the "second part". How can you have a character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story appear during such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped abruptly (it did not "end", it just stopped at what seemed to be the center of the story) to be replaced by an insane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to center around a Girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai receives a decent script to work!
