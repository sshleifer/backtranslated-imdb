I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime", I'm crazy to visit this city. I have been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its municipalities. I was hoping that this movie would touch me, that I wanted to jump on a plane and fly there immediately, but, behold, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it just does not work well. Perhaps this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it is said that thousands of people live alone. Can not you find love in New York?
