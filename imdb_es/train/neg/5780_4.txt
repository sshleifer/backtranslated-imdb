I really wanted to like this movie and I saw it all the time thinking that I had to improve. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst movie ever, but it never lives up to its potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was especially impressed by the witnesses of the return of David Naughton) and, God loves you, you can say that everyone did the best they could. It just falls short again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest's films and, although it makes it look easy, he probably should just forget to try to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic at this and should be seen more often ... they are the reason why they give me 4 stars. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suspect you'll want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" to direct it ... just think out loud there.
