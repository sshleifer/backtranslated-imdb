This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen. It is uncertain whether the writer of the script read Bronte's book or not. George C Scott is ridiculous and clumsy like Rochester, when he is not just a simple angry acting. Susannah York has the oldest hairstyle of the 1970s that I have seen in a Victorian movie. The characters almost do not talk to each other, so the rich jokes that are enjoyed in the book that is the basis of his deep intellectual love and lasting, are gone. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please, rent the Timothy Dalton version. He is so faithful to the book, it is like making the novel read to you aloud. Dalton is excellent as Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.
