There was something here with the female protagonist having this perfect life that she had always wanted after the worst possible life, beginning as a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But his background makes it impossible to trust Dean Cain and this completely destroys him in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position in which Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his son (I think the time frame makes it clear that it is his son and not his brother), but at the same time he can not forgive her for everything he has done, sleep with his brother (who shows the love and obligation that he felt was one way) and then be part of his death. In better hands, this would have been a better movie, but for something I caught on the nightly cable, it's not bad.
