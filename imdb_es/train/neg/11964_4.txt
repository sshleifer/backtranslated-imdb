Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy-drama about parents and children, the irresponsibility of adults and aging. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon who suffers a heart attack (ha ha), which makes him look for his estranged father (Alan King), an extra film that is considered a great star. The script is a nonsense sub-Neil Simon with a line in abundance, a flat and unexpressive direction of Henry Winkler (stuck in comedy mode situations), and family conflict is ready. Crystal and King do the best they can, but King is too anxious and, often, over the top. JoBeth Williams has another of his ungrateful roles, but he manages to bring his innate and homelike class to the proverbial character of the bride. It's a comedy, I suppose, but one that blinks tears ... shamefully. ** since ****
