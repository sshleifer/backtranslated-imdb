This was undoubtedly the stupidest, crudest and repulsive movie I've seen in a long time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as in the fascination of seeing a horrible car accident, I literally found it MANDATORY in every way possible and pulled it out to the end. I am by no means a donkey who opposes the comic representation of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, there's something about Mary, both American Pie movies, and even the famous Freddy Got Fingered that I found very nice in its own rude terms. The bath of sponges of Mamie Van Doren is the most terrifying appearance of a geriatric naked since The Shining. Ineptably edited and filmed, with incredibly annoying performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the movie ended, without the benefit of making me laugh once. The only useful purpose of the film is as an example of a textbook on how not to make a coarse image. Oh, and it would also serve very well as fertilizer for the lawn.
