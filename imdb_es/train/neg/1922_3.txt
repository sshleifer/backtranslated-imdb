About the baby: Why did not the older brother assume that he would be hungry for a bottle or some food or a diaper change? I should have been screaming nonstop after so many hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the baby to a safe place when he did not need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road miraculously clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Did not trees fell rooted in the roads and blocked them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the policemen at the barricade who did not immediately follow a young person who had crashed it, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That said, it was good to have a movie that children could see safely, for a change.
