An endless frenzy of ingenious visual irony does not necessarily create an attractive film. Half of the "Blonde Wig" movie never took off, perhaps due to the excessive complacency of its creators. <br /> <br /> Half of Wong Faye (with a very playful appearance, if Karen Carpenter seems, Faye Wong) has a lot more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the element of the story of the girl meets the child occupies a background to the artistic intelligence. The development of the character is unequal. The emotion is missing. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, the "Mung Jung Yun" by Wong Faye (Cantonese version of The Cranberry's hit "Dreams") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a version in Mandarin called "Zhen Tuo". Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is on the official CD of the film's soundtrack.
