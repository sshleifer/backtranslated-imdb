While I was watching this movie, I was thinking, it's okay, it'll be good any time ... I was wrong. The best real part of this movie was when it ended. A complete waste of 92 minutes. Leaving aside the seriousness, the best part was when finally appeared the Wendigo, who was at the end and really could not see so well. And the end of the queue was really a bit silly too. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen, but it was a disappointment. The worst part is that there was more talk about Wendigo than about Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you definitely could not say it for this movie.
