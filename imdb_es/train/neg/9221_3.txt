Everything you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks good, it has a solid original soundtrack that reflects the period of the late 60s, and all but some of its characters are unpleasant. Once you receive that message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Davies ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, when he takes his advice to join her in the real world, instead of living a fantasy movie of which he is the imagined director, he does so by separating and pairing with an actress who has idealized beyond reason. A couple of laughs and a little artistic direction are the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as documentation of the fall of Jason Schwartzman from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, the annoying annoyance of Schwartzman was something that had to be overcome, but here is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family connection clearly led him to this role; We hope your choices improve.
