I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS sign and I guessed that it had to be the best satire of all time. What a brilliant idea for a satire: gender abounds. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think everyone involved probably realizes) is a catalog of missed opportunities, performances that are not quite there and (fortunately) some extremely funny and inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks very bad here, probably because she is struggling uncomfortably to make her plain paper funny. David Hyde Pierce is sad to see, tries to be funny and looks like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny that just seeing her makes you laugh, but somehow her segment does not manage to become hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teenage manners and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also very funny (the nerd ones). I think the problem is that the director simply does not move things at the right pace. It begins very inexpressive, and that makes the tone monotonous. But when he lets things get really outrageous (the sequence of drugs is the second funniest moment I've had all year in movies, the first one also comes in a boring movie: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT), it's just funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just did not work. The clothes and style of 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as a mid and bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustratingly long sketches.
