Even when I saw this movie in a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a film about an artist who slept to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora is, even she could not prevent this excuse of a movie from sinking. Not even his photoshoot for Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" was promoted "in the past", could prevent this movie from sinking. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this a fault.
