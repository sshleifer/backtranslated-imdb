The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie I've ever seen. The plot is slow and scanty. The acting is almost comical. Although I love Paul Muni, now I can say that I have seen a movie that does not do justice to his true ability. The only saving grace that I found with this film is its production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. In addition, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are easily sold and were revolutionary at that time. Apart from the production value, I can not say anything else that is good or entertaining about this movie.
