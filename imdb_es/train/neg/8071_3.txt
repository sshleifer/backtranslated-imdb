I wanted to see this movie by Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect treat to watch throughout the film. This is really nothing more than a showcase for your appearance and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, at first glance, quite absurd. After a car accident, it is possible that some friends are dead, but they continue to live their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys chase after them, but we never find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are being chased). The final scenes seem especially ambitious filmed, but I can not get anything coherent from it. The opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut the wrist of a blonde girl and pick up some of their blood is never explained or followed. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons trying to get Cassie (Sagemiller) out of death ... but no, that does not seem to work. Bad guys are just bad guys; They really spoil a story that might otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs the bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
