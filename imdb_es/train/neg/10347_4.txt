I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and what caught my attention was that I think the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four children. They were about the same ages as the four guys in this movie. Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard spoke about the same values ​​and family tradition he would have heard from our twenty-sixth president without some of the more boisterous aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all the children of Stoddard serve in the First World War, in this case, although the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But, what happens if a female minx gets into this completely male house and interrupts things? That is the work of Susan Hayward here. In one of her first prominent roles, Hayward is a flirty loving girl who marries a son, has an affair with another and begins to make a play for the third. He is an early precursor of the type of party that later brought him an Oscar in I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I suppose that with a model of decorum as powerful as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter portrayed, everyone is afraid to tell the father what is going on. The children and also their governess Ingrid Bergman. This is where the plot becomes a bit silly. Bergman presents us as a governess hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial changes in business. Bergman has to be let go. She returns to France and years later returns to the family when the children grow up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe that children need a governess now. Hayward is absolutely right when she confesses that it was not the children who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have moved on with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that from a quarter to a third of the movie I edited has been removed. Possibly that could be the reason for the many holes in the plot we have. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Ingrid and Susan could not make another movie together in the 1950s when Hayward was at its peak and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe that a lot of Ingrid was left on the floor of the cutting room.
