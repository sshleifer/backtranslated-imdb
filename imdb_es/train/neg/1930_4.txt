Some have praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so, at least not for thinking adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a start like a live action movie, which surprised someone like the kind of trash you can not sell to adults. The "crack staff" of many old adventure films has been made much earlier, (think of "The Dirty Dozen") but _Atlantis_ represents one of the worst movies on that subject. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member makes of trot seems, at best, uncomfortable. An MD / Medicine Man, a Tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted to have children, if we have not seen them at least before, we have seen before the peculiarities of mixing and combining. The story about how a colleague, Vinny, played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower shops to totally unconvincing demolitions. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young academic obsessed with Atlantis. expressed by Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows Milo, a much younger young man, perched on one knee, while his grandfather places his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were thin at best, the best of _Atlantis_ was the talent voice. Maybe Milo's depth is not thicker than Fox's charm. Major Rourke loses nothing being expressed by James Garner. Although Rourke is a fairly military type, Garner shows his ability to give life to the characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highest point. I regret to say that the Dying King of Leonard Nimoy is nothing but mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as an expert in demolition, Vinny Santorini, also stood out for one or two well-made and fun lines, but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci anyway. <br /> <br /> Also well done was the computer animation. The animation of FUND, that's it. Character animation has not been so bad for Disney since the minimalism that led Don Bluth to leave. Character animation does nothing if it does not make flat characters appear even flatter. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say trite or trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any useful plot can be converted into something new with the appropriate treatment. Shakespeare often started from a well-known story and plot and was famous just for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously lacks that. <br /> <br /> I can not start with all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot are broken like a rope and the end does not make sense. To add to that, the script and animation are peppered with annoying oversights. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. Just at the beginning, when Milo reveals that the runic or Celtic symbols have been erroneously transliterated and the "Coast of Ireland" should read " Coast of Iceland ", we started having problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British version of Eire or Eireann as "Ireland", and completely ignore the old Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know about the Vikings' conspiracy to call the greenest island in Iceland and the coldest island in Greenland. <br /> <br /> By turning it into the subject of a misspelled "letter", the writers have been condemned to demand a runic version of English and a post-Roman date in the script. Since this is long after it was assumed that Atlantis had sunk in its underwater cave. And with no visible clues and less technology than Milo had, it made inscription much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. The Shepard's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, or it would not know anything about the cave or the crystal that is "in the eye of the King". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the hell did someone get the Leviathan. So how could I know more about something after that? And why would it be written in Atlantean? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in Atlantian. So it has to be a kind of automatic writing. As no one in Atlantis can read, they must be the spirits of the crystal messages transmitted to the surface. This would have made more sense. But it could also have been explained within the film: Milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life: he appeared in dreams, etc. This should be explored in the movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlanteans simply should not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to converse in Europe, more than the Romans would understand that the "c" hard or their day became "French" ch (pronounced like "sh" s, no less!) <Br /> <br /> 4. The present Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm, when apparently * they * could * read, but now they can not read what they used to do, nor operate similar machinery. <br /> <br /> 5. Massive illiteracy signals a crucial flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. He seems suspended in the air until Milo can rescue him. Although it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, nobody wants to compose poetry or write novels, and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantean school systems that go downhill towards the end and the lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis fell in reality. illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity began. EVERYTHING ELSE ** HARDLY ** qualifies your father for Deification !! The foolishness of Kashakim almost by itself erased his people from existence. He killed a group in the cataclysm, stalled progress (he did not kill much here, but he oversaw a massive landslide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone, if they were not boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> A blue ray of electricity should have shattered the image of Kashakim, when Kida tried to unite the image of his father to the circle of BIG Kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look at a book of gibberish and find a page in a glass, which he knew was a Crystal and not a stylized astrology or "phases of the Sun" diagram. <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke, he still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo reading it as part of the book. Plucking the page, which had the dog's ear in Rourke's hand, even though Milo apparently found NO sign of a torn page in the book, he was just there to warn the viewer that "something was not quite right" . Unless the word "crystal" had triggered the alarms on Milo's head that someone would try to steal it, Milo would not have suspected anything. It's just the thick-headed omen. <br /> <br /> 8. The "double cross" of the crew was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had agreed with Rourke from the beginning. However, the "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change, and I needed to be better motivated. It's hard to do with characters who were not given anything to begin with. <br /> <br /> 9. Insisting a little on the lava flowing upwards on the dome, instead of completing the rest of the area from where we see the sequence. It is liquid will not flow over the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. The final stinks! - and there is no more sense than placating political correctness. With its restored energy source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, it needs to be pampered. The giant guardian robots and the cycles of the sky that shoot blue rays suggest that they have less to fear from us than they could. Technology is superior to ours, and definitely at the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Milo needs to teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The idea is to leave your little culture calm and punished, not send it to hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** FINAL SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the plot of the Lost World and the scenario of the beginning of the century should give me a clue that this is more a tribute to pulps. The failures that I find with the film coincide with this idea. But I do not understand why I should pay to see lean characters and make holes simply because many dime novels also had them. And the pulp stories are part of the "shit that can no longer sell to adults," anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated and our pulp also needs to grow. The assailants of the Lost Ark lost nothing of their pulp sensation and avoided so much evil. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10: the film is nice, but as I think of the plot, it filters more and more.
