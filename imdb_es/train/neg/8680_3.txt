I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. Actually, the only thing that kept me watching was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad, it was something entertaining. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way in which they fall to the shooting, to their incredibly bad performance (the bad guys were removed from the street, or were they really actors?), Until the delivery of incredibly bad, to your inexplicable actions (if you are going to try to shoot someone through a door when entering, obviously, what you should do is shoot directly at the doorknob!). This film must beat the record of the worst lines written and delivered. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was also very bad: you can barely see what is happening in the fight scenes due to the changing angles and tremors of the camera. <Br /> <br /> I would have voted "1", except that I like Chiba and partner Sue Shihomi, and they entertained me a couple of scenes: 1) breaking the arm of a villain so that the bone comes out of the skin ( that has to hurt) 2) a capo of the drug that eats a brown-furred animal (a monkey?) cutting the corpse with a meat blade 3) Sonny Chiba is performing an impromptu surgery in one eye with a guy with the fingers. <br /> <br /> Actually I'm a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this really is not worth it for anyone. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and I've come to the conclusion that the only ones that are worth seeing (and they're great!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I have also heard that the Executioner and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend sticking to those.
