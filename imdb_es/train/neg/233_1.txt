This movie is a calculated attempt to capitalize on the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they had called it Sex at a funeral, they could have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools and can not get up. The characters emit an improbably brilliant dialogue, but never act remotely and recognizable as human. An arbitrary and meaningless action follows another to advance in what passes for a plot, and another soon tires of the falsehood of the entire company. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell receives points for playing her little heart, but performance honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (do not they have a height requirement for there?). Mrs. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. I wish we could say the same thing about the writer-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill bothers you for being a fake, get away from this one. Phonus bolognus in the half shell.
