My guess is that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see, what could it have been ... a. The frog storms would be creepy? second. Can I make someone like Tom Cruise say the word "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? do. Listen to my wife and have her say the word "F" every 2 seconds. Apart from this, I really liked the beginning and the storm of frogs. The rest was a relentless failure, too long (little edited), too lenient. I'm glad that many of you have enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
