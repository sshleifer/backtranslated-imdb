No one should try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for the screen. While the film is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well when read, is crap when you talk. Or, to put it another way, no one would suggest that listening to someone else's name was like seeing it written on a pearl radio. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie seems a badly adapted Cliffs. Notes to the book: most parts have been reduced to one fifth of their size in the book, in terms of background history and current history, and the end is tremendously (and unpleasantly) different from the book. Most of the frames of the book have been lost, including the one that makes everything meaningful at the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Eh?" Unfortunately, it's not a worthwhile effort: the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned and all the actors sent to do something much better. I greatly admire Gus Van Sant, but not even someone of his caliber could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.
