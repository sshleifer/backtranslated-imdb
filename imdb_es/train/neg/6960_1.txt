After seeing the first 20 million Blanche (sorry, I could not take it anymore), now I confirmed that no. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors involved in this ridiculous scrap piece. It begins with a concept used successfully in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronistic tone / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "delicacy" of direction that avoids the dreaded stigma of "heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon, horse-faced, ruins everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, simply turns into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be embarrassed and scandalized by watching excellent actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort fighting in the middle of this burlesque farce of the weasel.
