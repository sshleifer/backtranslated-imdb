A family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is a capture that is enchanted (BOO !!!). Aw, I did not want to make you jump. It's just a review. Sit again. Ahem, now anyway is obsessed by an old samurai who killed his wife and his lover in slow motion. This naturally causes a 3-minute scene to extend to approximately 7 or 8. Horrible performance. Horrid history. But how bad can it be that you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain started to melt and drip down my nose in pensive drops. It was SO wrong when Doug McClure appeared on the screen. I prayed to have flashbacks of Small Wonder (Yes, I know that Doug was in "Out of this world" and not in "Small Wonder", but it's almost the same damn show, And I can sing the song better "little wonder") There are movies that are so bad that they are good. this is not one of those <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My grade: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless , Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, one topless) <br /> <br />
