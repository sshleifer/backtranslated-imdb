I just saw this movie and I must say that, although at first some efforts were shown to produce a decent movie, it was absolutely horrible, but not in the way it was intended, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all potential viewers are idiots OR extremely difficult to entertain OR Or both ... Thank God for the rapid advance! I can not imagine the kind of spectator that the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, there are actors who try to be serious, though barely, and a script that cries out for a total rewrite, ... I can not say more. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror films, this would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie entertaining, I strongly suggest that you seek guidance on the purpose of the films. There is a much better price out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid trash like this.
