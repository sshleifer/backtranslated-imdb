In the delivery of the miniseries of the Tower of Babel, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> It's like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. <O /> <br /> Or that the bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> The writers of the greatest heroes of the Bible should at least have paid more attention to the chronologies of people and biblical events.
