We all know that a movie never does complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional. The important characters were eliminated, Blanca and Alba essentially became the same character, the majority of the subplots and the main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely minimized, making her seem a much more superficial character than the one I met in the book. In the book we learn more about his powers and the important effects he had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the movie, she was just a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Third-third, by the way, is the son and therefore comes after Second-second) and his connections with Esteban and his grandson of Pancha Garc√≠a (no son, whom he also made Recognize) is cut in half and its importance is minimized. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things about the book from which the film is almost stripped: this is called "The House of the Spirits". Where is the house? It is assumed that the history of 3-4 generations of a family revolves around the "big house on the corner", a line that is so often mentioned in the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film unfairly relegates it to a mere backdrop. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a silly and superficial film could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
