Cassidy from Hopalong with a horse that is not white and is not called Topper? Go figure! <br /> <br /> This farce is a grave injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays it is young against old, blond against white and kills people instead of firing the weapon from their hands. The real Hopalong, please, get up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever made and, believe it or not, by the person who brought us the grandfather saga.
