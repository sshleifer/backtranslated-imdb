This movie is a total dog. I found myself struggling to find something to laugh at just to not feel like I was wasting my money and my time. The writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It's a shame it does not live up to the standards of other Hale Storm films. <br /> <br /> They should have saved money on getting the D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spending the money working on the script until they were right. Even Gary Coleman was not used appropriately for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what was the point of most of the plot, including the subplots. After watching this movie, I am left with the impression that the producers hoped to capture some kind of Napoleon Dynamite humor, where it is not so much about the lines as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
