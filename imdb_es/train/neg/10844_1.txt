Unfortunately, this is not "the best British film from hell", although the DVD cover affirms this, which is what cheated me into buying it. However, it is a tribute to many of the great horrors of old movies, especially the Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... was filmed in mini dv, which although we all know has more than A television sensation that a movie, you can do much better. All the scenes, scenes and shots look as if they were illuminated in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear configuration), which improves the cheap aspect of the finished piece. The content of gore is, frankly, laughable. From the opening shots, where we see the foam head of a man, obviously destroyed, through cheap and sticky support hammers, the effects of creatures and the terrible CG, there was nothing that impressed me at all. <br /> <br /> The acting is abominable, from the almost comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, through Dani Filth, the bad guy from the least convincing horror movie I've ever seen. Each of the substations is more formulated than the previous one, and the sets get worse and worse as the movie is played. Look for the 'Mental Asylum' - a semi-independent Georgian house with a bad cg sign on the outside, and the weirdest (and not in a good way) quilted cell I have seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to get to the end of the movie without my attention wandering (no, running) at any available opportunity. In fact, I found myself cleaning the dust at a certain time while the movie was in motion. <br /> <br /> However, it marks one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I think is one (um, two) things. She has gone for it. However, once you are out of the way, everything is downhill. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I'd love to believe them, but with this evidence it's not likely to. If you want a good tribute to Amicus, avoid this and go for the Christmas special of the League of Knights. <br /> <br /> Currently fighting Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have. never seen.
