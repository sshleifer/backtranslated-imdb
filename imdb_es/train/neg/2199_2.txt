I captured "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I had high hopes in this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX business card. The story is pretty boring. The bad lighting and the work of the camera, along with the not so good editing and music, make the film seem low quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask that the FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of The technical production will be on par with the FX! You can not get away with the best effects in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big fuss. At least so fast, great and even a little funny! None of that can be said about "Dolores Perdidos".
