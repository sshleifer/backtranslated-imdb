I was interested in the subject and only the fans of Drew Barrymore's dance on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting about him. OK, she shows some breasts (or maybe a double body does). The plot is cut into pieces and the performance is horrible. None of the cables have any material to work with, since the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Do not waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want a spooky Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another one, skip this and go back to Darko. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is also absolutely criminal. Check out Charles Williams' novel "Descent Into Hell" to see something worth considering. This is just an excuse to make a B movie to go directly to the video and take the lives of the people of Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think that acting here was laudable? Give me a break.
