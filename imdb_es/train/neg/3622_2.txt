I captured this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the television show of my youth, I decided to see it together with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to accompany him, because this is just weird! Not only is it a musical with annoying melodies, the necessary corny effects and the cameos of the stars that have passed their collective cousins, but also seems to have been produced as someone's good acid trip. Speaking flutes, British children too old for this kind of shit ... in the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuugggghhhhhh! What was I like?" If you are a big fan of all the work of Sid and Marty Krofft, do it; otherwise, unless you are willing to make a loop before looking, stay far, far, far away.
