This is a humble movie. It has no real plot. We never have access to motivations, apart from wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors that have been filmed. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is being controlled by these three elderly people. Why are they doing what they are doing? To frighten other members of the group? I do not know. There is some fog in a fog machine that circles the corridors and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Do something? I do not know. There is some nudity for its own sake. I'm always surprised to see this in such old movies. Things have been established in this regard these days. Anyway, people run like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; without resources; No, nothing. There are about five foolish climaxes in the movie. Who are these people and "is" there is a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with full confidence. What a mess.
