Unless you are between 10 and 14 years old (with the exception of the R rating), there are very few things that you will like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are comedians and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but unfortunately, that's it. Bad plot The bad performance. Worst writing and delivery. The special effects are sad. Although the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, the significant individual encrusted situations are equally terrible. If we consider the parts of action, well, there are incredible action sequences in some movies that make you dizzy and there are some that make you moan. This movie only contains the last type. This leaves little to the left. I'm so glad I did not pay for this. <br /> <br /> Despite any exaggeration, I can read and think, so as I sat watching, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was somewhat worried when entering. However, like a train crash, one can not simply look the other way. And even without expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I am very tolerant of bad movies, but this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) worthy of Oscar. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of junk over CGI is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, little man and gigli. How this is currently rated 7.2 completely disconcerts me. Washing the brain or stacking the voting system somehow is all I can think of as answers. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that tonight, I witnessed a train crash. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
