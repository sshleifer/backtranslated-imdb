For a great classic tale, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script that completely lacked dramatic tension. The rubric of club history is useful and would have provided a new version of the literary classic. For some strange reason, that rubric was dropped from the beginning. Knowing that this was filmed in 21 days tells me "hurried" and unfortunately it shows. Now we will have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I mean FX, I can tolerate CGI really horrible, but the script has to rock and this was too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I would blame the actors but ... since I know that writing more than acting, I will choose my colleague.
