The first episode set the bar high enough, I thought. It was starring William Hurt as a hit man hired to kill a toy maker. We are given very little information about his character or who is paying to kill, in fact, the episode is notable for not having any dialogue. Upon returning to his modernist penthouse, he is given a package containing toy soldiers, this makes him smile, but he dismisses him and takes care of his affairs. But he is in a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war, driving jeeps, firing machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters! Special effects are good for a TV show and they become quite tense when you dodge the apartment using your wits to survive, sometimes getting the advantage and sometimes not. I will not ruin the end, but it is enough to say that it was a small intelligent turn. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all crap and I lost interest in the room. The adaptations of Stephen King are always a mixed bag and these are not an exception
