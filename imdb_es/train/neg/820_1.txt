What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's disconcerting script? Were some pieces left on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did you see in this confusing story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who had a horrible performance, accept such an ungrateful role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be in the same position as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and loses the mark by a very wide margin. A great fire failure by Stanley Kramer.
