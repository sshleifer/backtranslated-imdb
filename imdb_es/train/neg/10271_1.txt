This movie had to be the worst horror movie I had ever seen. The performance was terrible, horrible and corny and speaks of a predictable plot! I will never see this movie again nor recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie started, I realized what I had gotten myself into. All they did for this movie was to copy scenes from many other horror films and group them in this one movie. The joke calls, Halloween night, a psychopath and a knife! It is absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies should do. As for the making of the movie, it's pretty funny how everyone talks about how this movie was so cool and so terrifying. I mean, how come you do not realize that movies are a cheap copy of "Scary Movie," for example? At least get some good actors there and then maybe it would have been taken out as a good horror movie.
