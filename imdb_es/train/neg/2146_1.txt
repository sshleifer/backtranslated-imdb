I'll just put it here, that was the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've seen. In 1950, Disney released what I call one of its best films of all time. Now remove the great songs, add a poor plot that looks like a lost television show. "Put it together and what do you get?" The biggest Crud load I've seen. After seeing this, I thought it was over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended with "and they lived happily ever after". It is not garbage. This movie did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like "A turn in time" that was moderate but better than this. Also, what does Anastasia care? She changed sides like Iago did, but that did not help anyone.
