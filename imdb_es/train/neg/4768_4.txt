I ran into Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking that I could deal with an average movie. This movie, however, was slightly lower than average, but you can still see it. The script was poorly written and the performance was on average for a level B movie with a couple standing out as pretty good. The plot borders on Saw's, teaches people what they did wrong in a situation and tries to make them appreciate life more, but that's where the comparison really ends. Nine dead try to have a heart and a purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main flaw that I found in Nine Dead was the slap in the face of the spectator of the flashbacks that happened 3 minutes earlier in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people will not see coming, in a bad way. . Except spoilers, I've seen the worst of bad movies and they did not end up so bad. Decent movie, bad acting and ending though ...
