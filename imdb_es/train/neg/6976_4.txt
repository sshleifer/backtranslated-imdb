At the time of its release, Robert Altman's accelerated pace was omitted in the new Western book from Edmund Naughton's book "McCabe," but in recent years it has garnered a large following. Apart from a fully convincing city scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the image is (intentionally) between brackish and unattractive. The bearded Warren Beatty plays a businessman of the turn of the century who settles in a community in difficulties on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; Once the profits begin to arrive, Beatty is naturally threatened by the men of the city who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn and wintery atmosphere for the film that gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this small and sad city is limited: most of the story is composed of vignettes, and the Altman's step is deliberately slow. Just a statement is being made (in fact, quite the opposite) and the languid actors look at each other without thinking about anything. It is a counterproductive image and yet, in a strange way to Altman, the defeat looks proud. ** since ****
