Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the film: shots too long in the face, where most of the time you have the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing (the screen is cut off), because there seems to be important actions running in, but you can not see them. Anyway, there is already too much confusion in the film, so these angles of vision make it worse and do not contribute to clever visual images. <br /> <br /> I like artistically made films and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this is trying to be something ingenious and fails painfully in my opinion. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be attached to, none of the characters, because they are not well developed. To work the characters it takes more than minutes face to face, at least with this set of scriptwriters + directors + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if part of the not so good performance is due to the script. And director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from the films written and directed by Le You safely in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone who would be interested in that part of the story and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
