Baldwin has really crouched down to make those movies. The script, the music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The FX sound does not sound real, they stick out too much (technical devices, etc.) if they try to make a movie about things like this, at least try to be real with them and release those beeps and beeps additional, because those devices do not make sounds as strong as those. Natural sounds as steps and others that do not exist, which gives an atmosphere of emptiness. <br /> <br /> The direction seems fine for a film with such a low budget (I hope it is a low budget production), although sometimes it seems quite amateur. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and fake, they just have not cast this movie very well. I imagine that it would have been a better idea to have Baldwin speak some Spanish than to have Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that it is the most alive and lively language, that is why the performance of the actors can suffer. To a large extent if you use a strange language. I mean, could someone finally realize how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? I should have buried a corpse long ago in the production of movies. Has the production team heard about subtitles? This film again manages to represent the European police as lazy and corrupt, and societies as vulnerable and defenseless. I mean if the plot is like "Interpol can not do anything, so let's call an American to take down this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures is on the same path as Columbia before. It's just producing movies for the fun of it. I imagine that they also have self-esteem. Are buyers supposed to buy all dirty titles just because Sony gets something good several times a year? Maybe they should have used the same equipment they were doing Di Que Si - Di I Do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the film afloat. It looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
