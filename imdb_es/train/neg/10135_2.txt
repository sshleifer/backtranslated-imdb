I just watched this movie in Starz. Let me go through some things that I thought could have been improved; Performance, writing, direction, special effects, camera equipment, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea about anything that had to do with the movie. Apparently, in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, I could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Today, those things cost around $ 3 billion and can not become invisible. Apparently, you can fly from the US UU To the Middle East in one hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not care about, but it seemed like a boring attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera could randomly approach the actors and jump to random scenes. Oh yes, since it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable like hell. In general, I classify it just above with Serpents on an airplane.
