Well, there is no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can also be fun sometimes, but it's not like that in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive and there is a great scene in which two characters fall from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but in general there is not much to recommend "Kite". Look at it if you want, but you will not miss much if you skip this ...
