Having endured this inaccurate film, I will admit that it is a more modern version of the story than previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and has become so politically correct that it made me angry after seeing it. Davy Crockett was very badly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would probably have been better chosen as Sam Houston given the love of both men for oratory. I think the self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a true Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and would definitely have fueled his hungry sense of self-adoration. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mentality, I feel that Davy Crockett was the Texan par excellence even though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is "It does not boast of being a fact" was created for Crockett. And that last scene in the Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett. Even to suggest that this giant of man and experienced fighter would be carried away alive is ridiculous. Three different testimonies from eyewitnesses put him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more Mexican soldiers killed after intense hand-to-hand combat. Finally, that lame ending in the film supposedly represents the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texans vs. 700 Mexican soldiers when in reality there were about 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Every child in the Texas school who pays attention in his first Texas history class knows that the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during the siesta and the Mexican army was so confused that they could not form ranks and fled, since they were not trained to fight hand in hand in a border style. hand.
