Comedy of a note that probably puts the teeth of modern feminists to the limit. Betsy Drake, a department store clerk, is in love with the idea of ​​babies and marriage, and puts her hopes in women's magazines until she spies Super-Bait in the form of the single and elegant Cary Grant. The rest of the film moves heavily from one stratagem to another, while the implacable Drake pursues its prey. I guess the word "happy" simply sums up Drake's approach to the role. She has a lovely smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, I started taking an overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and less his usual style. However, there is a scene that almost rescues this slender exercise. Drake asks the unfortunate Grant after his lecture to a room full of respectable ladies. Here his cheerful style has an unforced freshness that is really remarkable, and if the production did not rub our noses with that optimistic smile for 90 minutes, the film could have been more than a camp dream for girls, around 1948.
