This was a strange kind of movie about a low life in New York City and focuses on a main character (the name of the title, played by Brad Pitt) who believes he is a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent. . <br /> <br /> It's a little entertaining to watch until a profane, New York-type New Yorker with a horrible accent comes on the scene and takes over. That ruined the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough women with her mouth full of garbage. <br /> <br /> Pitt's hairstyle, an exaggerated Pompadour, was fun to watch. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: it's strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (apart from Woody Allen) with only mono sound.
