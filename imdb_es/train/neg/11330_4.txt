"Giant" is one of the most boring and excessively long Hollywood articles in history. Many scenes seem completely false and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central notion of this film, that a rancher would resist drilling for oil in his land, is absurd, and I know it because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean who serves Taylor coffee, redeem this otherwise boring film. For a much more accurate and interesting description of how modernism changed ranches in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
