I can not say that I liked this movie very much. He has some funny moments, but he does not seem able to decide if it's a comedy or a drama. It really does not work as such either. It's too light-toned to be a drama, and the fun moments are few and far between. It does not make much sense either. Things seem to happen without reason. And they are also extremely complicated. I feel they only did things Until they went. If they had taken a little time to explain things, this could have been a better movie. I would say the ending was anti-climatic, but that would mean that the rest of the movie was actually being built. to something, that he did not. just order it, and that's it. I did not find it boring, really, but as I said, there is no point. I'll give Winter Kills a little reluctant and weak 3/10
