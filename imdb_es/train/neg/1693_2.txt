My husband and I went to see this movie, being the fans of the horror movies that we are. Two hours later, I found myself wanting to recover both my money and my time. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this movie basically contained the best points of the movie. The film was not scary, apart from the good moment in the surprise tickets, etc. I found that most of the 'frightening' parts are more comical than anything else. After seeing other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is considered frightening in Japan is not what scares here in the United States. My advice: if you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting in this one. I can not really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental on the way.
