Seeing a videotaped replay of about eight different Spider-man cartoons from 1994-1997, I realized why I could not stand it when it first appeared. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school, where I worked in 1967. The cartoon of Spider-Man was the best and is still the best. (I will not go into the psychedelic version, which is terrible, give me traditional villains, please.) <br /> <br /> Acting on new things is bad, read a sheet without feeling or exaggeration. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best in voice acting for Spider-man. Nobody comes close. Seeing Secret Wars, a great idea for a cartoon miniseries, made me shudder. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull does not have a German accent, while Ock is a heavy Russian. The old Marvel Comic Heroes series of 1966 had a better voice acting. Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America seemed authoritarian, not like a teenage boy. Paul Frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing of all time. The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Did you ever hear Mel Blanc's son? No way can he reply to his dad. <br /> <br /> The animation is clumsy. Granted, they have all the nuances of elegant characters and well-painted backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer take over the movements, they become robotic. I really do not think any of these animators know what's between them. <br /> <br /> The stories are poorly written, and some of the lines they give to the heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when the heroes unite for the first time, do they start fighting with each other? In Secret Wars, it was an unconvincing excuse that put them at odds. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious, like the Punisher, but why the Thing and the Iron Man can not control their temperament between them is ridiculous, then the Torch unites. This is just another of the later comics. tendencies for the heroes to confront each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be done, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "Do not tell me what to do" are LAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne is unmasked to spoil Peter's wedding. All that scenario was horrible. <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, is what another critic calls Youth Violence, which means that there are no punches at all. In Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully avoided the burden of the Thing. But The Thing hits the bad guys through a whole block in the comics. He just has to pick up heavy things again and subdue a bad guy by grabbing him in the cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults, but for children under 12 years of age. That's why they can not have punches, because mom and dad do not believe in that kind of violence. But you can exploit things, these cartoons will include that. When I was a child, before political correctness became fashionable, I saw cartoons sticking together. What happens with a hit to the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today because those new clever and clever caricatures took the hit? I find this the most insulting of all when I see new things. They have written "the blow" because we could all be hurt. <br /> <br /> Children, enjoy these cartoons as much as you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 classification
