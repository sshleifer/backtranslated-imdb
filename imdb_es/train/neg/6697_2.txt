Crazed shotgun. Walkers in search of incest. Revenge and obsessive disorder. "Dad raped me when I was 12." He wore handcuffs, all prostitutes dressed in latex are just some of the features that will be presented to you in this complete disgrace of a movie. They can be easily viewed on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4 a.m. on a Sunday night. (And yes, I know it was a complete sentence, but apart from my people, this is a long review for a meaningless short film). <br /> <br /> Shot in "somewhere" in Canada, with almost no budget, the plot of this show is trivial, the police obviously have never heard of "State Jurisdiction" because they end up chasing Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiot, retentive anal, generic, unsafe undergraduate student) throughout the United States (and I thought that only the FBI could do that). The camera is unstable, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad that it could actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> Until the skin scenes Go (which is the only reason to rent this movie, do not even think about buying it) there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth seeing, though, which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (inserts an unknown actor here, obviously has not done anything else worth noticing) in a sleazy Motel room and disgusting (the guy with the leaking sink that drips, and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it). Everything is S & M people (crops, wives, hot wax and underwear) and in the end, they leave it in a motel room, without money and police waiting at your door (that's to show you, do not let a prostitute tie you up in a motel room "in the middle of nowhere." However, unfortunately, Kari does not show a skin that is worth remembering, and that can only cause deep traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so it is definitely a disappointment to this movie. <br /> <br /> As for the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would not mind if I revealed it to you, but I will not, you should spend your hard earned money on that. a 1/5 for the action, a 3/5 for the skin (see the last paragraph) and a 0/0 for the performance, character development or intricate twists in the plot. <br /> <br /> - Man who laughs
