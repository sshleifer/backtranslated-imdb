The original series of novels by Lensman is a classic of the genre. It's pure adventure with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood has not filmed it literally because it's the kind of thing they like: massive explosions, superweapons, super heroics, hero receives the girl, extraterrestrials ( great CGI potential), or against evil in the purest form, etc. In its place (and considering that I am an anime lover and that of Japan), we get this horrible movie for kids that rips the entrails. From the story, the mixes in Star Wars (ironically as the latter ripped the books from time to time) pastiches and muted the whole thing up to the 'Thundercats' level. Seeing Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second stage of Lensman, portrayed as a small child, is regrettable (etc.). I just can not understand why the manufacturers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have won a lot more money (AWAY!) Saying the right thing. Has no sense.
