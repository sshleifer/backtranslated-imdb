Despite the theme, this is an amateur movie, exhibitionist, or an effort in one, which is as interesting and daring as the composition book of a high school student full of death "poetry". Without a doubt, it will disturb the spectators who are determined to be bothered, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To really get under someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film contains an evocative image, which is shown as a still image (and is also used in the video cassette), but without any development that leads or moves away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie, that is, a movie.
