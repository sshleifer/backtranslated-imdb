Mulva is put on a suggestion by Teen Ape. When he wakes up, he's considerably sexier (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and in search of revenge for those who did it wrong. As the subtitle and the art of the box imply that this is really a takeoff from the "Kill Bill" movies, but this is a Chris Seaver movie, it is a tremendously incompetent satire (and I use that last term in a very general way) I would love to say that this is better than the first movie, but the truth is that I was very surprised when I saw the previous movie, I can not wait to compare the two at this moment. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought the sequel (look when I'm drunk I like it, for lack of a better word, full movies and shit) There are some laugh moments out loud (very few), but I do remember Bonejack being more fun but nevertheless. Well, at least a little over an hour, it's fast beating what it's worth. <br /> <br /> My degree: D + <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Audio commentary from director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon, and the Lbp gang; Second comment from Seaver; 31 minutes of featurette making; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute homage to low-budget images; Commercial 2-minute syrup fake; stills gallery; Promotional trailer and trailers for: Mulva "," Quest for the Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2, & 3; "The Feral Man", "The Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Demon Summer" and "Splatter Rampage Wrestling"
