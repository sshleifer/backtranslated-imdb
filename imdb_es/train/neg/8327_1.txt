IN AGREEMENT. So it's a low budget "movie" (I used the quotes because it was filmed in the Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrible, the make-up is ridiculous (it seems that the blood came from Sherwin-Williams and I have seen more convincing bruises made with Halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting in general seems to have used the borrowed Toyota van to shine headlights about the actors. <br /> <br /> I could forgive these low-budget features if there were any real content, if a movie tried to tell a story. But this collection of video images can boast that there is no argument, no real characters or impulse. It is a self-indulgent disaster. <br /> <br /> And do not worry, there are no spoilers here, because there is absolutely nothing to ruin.
