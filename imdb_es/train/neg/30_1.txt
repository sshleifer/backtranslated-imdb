I did not like the idea of ​​the female turtle since 1987, we knew that TMNT was four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies, and each of the four brothers bears the name of the great artists like Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello, for what Venus here has no meaning or has an important role, and I think the old TMNT series was much better than the new one that contains Venus. As a female turtle it will not add any action to the story we like. of the TMNT we knew in 1987 that having new enemies in each part is a good point to have some action, but having a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we want to see more news of the TMNT series, but at same as the same characters we met in 1987 without that female turtle.
