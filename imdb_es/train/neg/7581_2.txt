I saw this movie the other day at a film school, and I had not seen a film by Almodóvar before, but I went in hoping it was good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a meaningless movie with just a couple of laughs mixed with two hours of sheer boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that could have worked in their own separate movies, but together they do not add up to any kind of significant set at all. <br /> <br /> Or that I thought. Then, the next day, my film teacher spent the whole class period explaining all the little hidden details of the film, like for example, the mural that represents the stereotyped flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is a comment on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under the fascist government. Apparently, the whole movie is full of small clever visual tricks and references like this one. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good movie: you still have to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something that interests the viewer enough to worry about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange and unusual characters, but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to be using them to make any kind of argument. What is the meaning, for example, of the revelation of the surprise character of Hitchcock that occurs toward the end of the film? Why is that even there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the film is nothing more than meaningless film references and visual cues that apparently exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodóvar is. But no matter what my film teacher says, it takes more than a self-indulgent deception for a movie to be good.
