This nasty video was initially banned in Britain and was allowed last November without cuts. <br /> <br /> Presents the Playboy Playmate of the month of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and the foggy images of the jungle. I'm not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for a ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the rescue. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to spend time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) complains incessantly. <br /> <br /> The rescue exchange goes to hell, and Laura finds herself in the jungle. Will Peter save it before the cannibals eat? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was an unpleasant video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) in the kidnapper's boat. Montossé undresses very comfortably. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, who has already been captured. They spend their time having sex and do not see danger approaching. The guts, someone? Big fight between Peter and the naked demon (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, guts, a lot of full frontal, some great contortions of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the line, "They tore out your heart", which is very funny if you watch the movie.
