The cars in this movie are awesome. The acting in this movie is horrible. The plot and the driving scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If movies really bother you where someone changes and suddenly becomes ridiculously faster, save yourself the hassle and the money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there's a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can not tell the difference, go see it, you'll have fun. It really comes down to this, there are really really good cars in this movie, they are driven horribly and they are completely unreal. The acting is horrible mainly due to the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, activate mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such good cars are represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were the same as the movie, they should compete with rusted bicycles.
