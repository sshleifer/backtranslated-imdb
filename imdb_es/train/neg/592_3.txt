All logic comes straight out of the window of the train in this British horror film, set in the London Underground and starring the generally reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way to a party the office to meet with friends who fall asleep in a subway station, only to wake up and discover that she has been locked up and is being persecuted by "someone" or "something" with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> The holes of the plot and the incredibleness abound. There are very few moments that are really restless / scary, but there are many that are simply boring. <br /> <br /> In general, an unpleasant movie that should stay locked up forever and do us all a favor. <br /> <br /> The only positive point here is the inclusion in the cast of the popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who has done better than this? That's even including "Erasmus Microman"!
