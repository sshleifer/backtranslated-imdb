Take a look at the film's website, he spent more time doing that than writing the script for this film. I could not be more off in his boasting. Original story? Original? They must have found the hidden script between the old testament, or face a legal repercussion for that horn. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a wax cup. Cinematography with style? Oh yes, the most fun aspect of home videos in the United States is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money available for this title, so, of course, the CF is not really that good, or a little bad from time to time, or just very funny, but it's the story that makes this movie is a waste of time. and money. 4 stories gathered in one and all of them brainless fragments of seen before and done.
