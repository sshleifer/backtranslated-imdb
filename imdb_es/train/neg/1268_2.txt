Oh, what a condescending movie! Located in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the point of view of Hollywood filmmakers, this film tries to be a profound social commentary on contemporary American anguish. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped characters of great diversity with different socio-economic backgrounds. They intersect in their everyday, monotonous lives. The plot is disconnected and disconnected. Numerous unimaginative plot projects keep the film going, such as: a shooting, a baby abandoned in the brush, a band of bullies who intimidate a lawyer, a guy who flies through the night sky over the city, a boy in a camp Of summer. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the only constant is the generous help of the sociological "ideas" imparted through dialogue, since the characters compare notes about their life experiences. One character tells another: "When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize the joke that we are, those rocks laugh at me, I could say, me and my worries; humor for that Grand Canyon. " <br /> <br /> And another character pontificates about the meaning of all this: "There is an abyss in this country, an increasingly widening gap between people who have things and people who do not. .. it is as if this big hole had opened in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what is spilling ... is a rash of rage, and rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the superficial and elegant characters, apart from the silly plot, the rhythm of the story is terribly slow. Acting has no inspiration and is superficial. The tone of the film is cocky and self-satisfied, in contempt of the script by the spectators. <br /> <br /> This was a film project approved by Hollywood costumes that consider themselves as omnipotent gurus, watching from on high. They think their film will be a surprising revelation to us, humble and ignorant moviegoers, eager to know the real meaning of American social change.
