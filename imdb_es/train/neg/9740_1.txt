Now where was I? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <Br /> <br /> Ooops, I'm sorry. Yes, "The Projected Man." Well, it's a British science fiction festival that has nothing to do with it. A type of orange head is projected with a laser and receives the touch of death. At last it vanishes, the end. Actually, the movie is not that interesting. Bored, monotonous, starched, rigid and boring, "The Projected Man" is 77 solid minutes of nothing, starring no one. Bored as dishwashing water. Bored as the shooter's dust. Bored as Ethan Hawke, we are really talking SAME here, people! But wait, with respect to our bored cousins ​​on the other side of the pond, MooCow will now make an adequate review of "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... .. <= 8.
