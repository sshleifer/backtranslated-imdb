This movie is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but even he can not save the tired idea and the Swiss cheese script. Think of "Police Academy 7" and apply it in a military parody. Yuck <br /> <br /> I do not feel that the comments of other users reflect the bad rating that this film received (and that I deserved!). It is extremely deceptive. I have often seen this movie with a price of $ 3.00 at the grocery store and now I certainly know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could recover my 90 minutes ...
