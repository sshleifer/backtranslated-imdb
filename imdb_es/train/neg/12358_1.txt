The character of Demi Moore in the film was selected for the SEAL because of her appearance. That was a bad start and the movie came down from there. The plot was totally incredible. The will to do it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what make life interesting.
