### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? Out of control editing and cinematography that coincides with a terrible plot. It's sad to see how Denzel Washington's talents are wasted on a garbage like this. Certainly, it is suggested to us how Mexicans can not save themselves, external forces, possibly military, Americans are needed. And we know that the father is a somber character, after all he is a Mexican, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey because he is American. He killed them all thinking that she died. And her? Of course, it will not, it's a small girl and you're not supposed to hurt the Hollywood fan's sensibilities. The exchange scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the "unlikely success" (as some critic pointed out) 'Taken'. The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It is in the classification of such films that we have to doubt the credulity of IMDb.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
