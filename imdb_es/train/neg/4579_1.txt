"What the hell do we know !?" It was one of the worst moments I've spent in the cinema. It was less a movie and more a special one after school, but at the same time nothing special. The attempt of a narrative on which they based their ideas was absolutely pathetic, that almost anyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear simply should not happen. I'm not going to dwell on it. What I will reveal is a criticism that many can not formulate. This film, although tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in the reasoning. It was horribly contradictory because he took a manipulator, he became a creator of your life, in a manifestation of abundance, in a piece of propaganda without shoes. Interconnectivity is explained as a large part of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It is completely ignored that there are other people with minds that could control us, which seems to be the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist limit us enormously. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity do not mix unless you are an almighty God. If he is, he will be impressed (?!?) For all the interesting things that this movie will reveal that he can do. If not, you will be very disappointed, an imbecile, or maybe both. Also, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to watch the movie because I feel retarded by mentioning it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
