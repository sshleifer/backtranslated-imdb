How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films is harder to believe than cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought Hands: Hands of fate was the worst piece of shit I had seen, but at least Hands moves so slowly that you could fall asleep, thus rescuing your eyes from the pain they will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this movie is that the old man who keeps the Hobgoblins "locked up" comes to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
