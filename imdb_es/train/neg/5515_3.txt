There is much good that can be said about this caricature; The backgrounds are rich, exuberant colors and full of art deco details very well made. The animation is up to the usual study standards of the time, which are certainly higher than today. However, I find it tedious for several reasons. <br /> <br /> The Music: Definitely does not live up to the usual standards of Scott Bradley. Although it is probably supposed to be reminiscent of a "Great Gatsby" scenario, it ends up being sad, sleepy, repetitive, and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same, as demonstrated by Beethoven's 5th Symphony). Since most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there is a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that the average viewer will not see. <br /> <br /> The Storyline: I'm not revealing any secrets that are not yet in the plot summary: good country, bad city. This is a common theme in the movies, both animated and live, of this era. It is a nostalgia out of place for a nonexistent rural idyll that, at present, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for the "values" that never existed.
