There are really two sections of this movie. First of all, there's a ridiculous prologue to the movie, which is as hysterical as a corn ball that almost seems appropriate for Troy McClure from 'The Simpsons' to do the telling. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie begins (starting with a title song that does not really fit in with the rest of the movie) that, although technically it's okay, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and little plot convincing and not only with uninteresting characters, but with characters that do not make sense. This is especially so with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who was supposedly involved in the plot and part of the 'organization' all the time, however, what would have happened if Hackman had made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take it with you when breaking? In that case, it would have been a completely superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end remains. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the film is that it is not willing to put any detail on who or what. is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to imply that a particular sector of society would be able to create such an organization and, on the other hand, was satisfied with the hope that a lack of explanation would be sufficient and the audience would form its own conclusions. br /> <br /> In short, the film fails at all levels.
