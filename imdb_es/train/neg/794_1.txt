Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars that star in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review after you have reached the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> FORGET YOU NEVER FIND CINEMA AND GO TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idols handsome guys who present an intricate and complicated "plot" that drags in a lot of time unbearable until you're ready to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people who express diverse emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously, we can see that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we simply DO NOT GIVE A SHIT WHY because there is no background story. <br /> <br /> When this movie is over, you will be sick and tired Of these stupid, stubborn, girly star faces. You will rebel for having spent all this time watching them smile, mock, cry, look mysterious, be "serious" and any other meaningless expression they put on their faces. <br /> <br /> Some fool would do it. Never go so far as to refer to this insipid piece of junk, since being the "soul" of any of your "actors" should undoubtedly prove to you what the trailer and worship countless comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only henchmen "converts" senseless will like this movie, most of them teenagers with a pathological adoration for any androgynous thing . Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of these senseless "fanatics", stay away from this abomination.
