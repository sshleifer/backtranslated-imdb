Becky Harris plays the buying woman whose misfortune is being in the store at the wrong time and, obviously, the ONLY purpose of this movie is to provide a reason to wear down the remotes! Miss Harris seems to me to be over fifty when she first appears on the scene. Once the redheaded thug ends with her, it becomes clear that this is not a queen of AARP. If these are not some of the best assets that have been shown on celluloid, I want someone to give me a clue. Absolutely amazing in my opinion, and I literally wore my VHS copy capturing its charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie really is not worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, however, I was disappointed in both aspects. God bless Becky Harris!
