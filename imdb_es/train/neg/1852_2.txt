Whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke. I mean, this was the stupidest movie I think I've ever seen! Does a killer snowman terrorize a small town? Give me a break. I love it when the police car is driving. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent this. If you really want a horror movie, get away from it!
