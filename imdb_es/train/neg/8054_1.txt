Oh dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and unpleasant ... Remember the shot of "the Natural", where lightning strikes the tree (leaving a bright stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from ?? Well, the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene in which a tree branch crashed into the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use the images of The Natural, or just hoped that No one who would see the film would take it back? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, where they tried to escape in the truck. Such overacting in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad movie, a really bad movie.
