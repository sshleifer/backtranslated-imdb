If the writer / director is reading this (and I imagine you are since you should be out of work), then I must say that I have seen some bad films in my time, but this has the distinction of having the worst premise. Have you ever heard? <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total loss of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (if the whole movie was in a coma, does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean that someone raped her while she was eliminated?) Absolute trash.
