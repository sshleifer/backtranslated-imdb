First seen 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny's comedy, murder mystery with very few laughs. The film seems to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits, but was rewritten by two popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers does not cut it in comparison to his other efforts. The story is about a couple of Americans traveling far and wide, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who meet a lost dog and hope to earn a fortune in rewards after seeing an ad in the newspaper for the return of the dachsund. When they try to return it, they see a hand protruding from the door of a garage in the residence of the lady who they believe is attached to the rest of the corpse of the woman who must give them the money. They get scared and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they do as fugitives from the scene waiting to be framed by the murder. The other characters in the film meet in a train before this and meet in a Monte Carlo casino doing several things to get them into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about the death, they begin to question the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their ridiculous lies to find out what really happened. None of the characters' actors mentioned above can get this movie out of its mediocre state despite some fun moments mostly provided by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a horrible movie, it just is not so good. There are a lot of average movies out there and this is just another one for the stack. Try it, maybe you like it, you probably do not like it.
