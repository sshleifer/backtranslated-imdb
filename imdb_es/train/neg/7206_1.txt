All right. Where to start Let's say this; Avoid this movie at all costs <br /> <br />. It is based on a series of cartoons. The film makes the cartoon look like <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Full of emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be here <br /> <br /> here, lousy camera work, terrible music, and enough product placement to <br /> <br /> make you never want to visit Yahoo ! Again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett make their way through this image with the gay abandonment <br /> <br /> of men who have seen a rare kind of paycheck In the distance . "<br /> <br /> They should pay us some of the millions they earned to see it. <br /> <br /> It's horrible.
