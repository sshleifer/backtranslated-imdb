The original "Cube" is a fantastic film in B rich in paranoia, fleshy characterization and excellent extraordinary performances. It's creepy, cryptic and cool. And it's perfectly fine, on its own, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero." <br /> <br /> This third (!) movie in the Cube series is part of retreading (most of the explosive traps are sadly recycled), part aberration. Take the bold step of explaining what the cube is, something that was never revealed in the first movie, but since that explanation is bland, I would prefer it to be kept secret. There are some potentially interesting references to society that exist outside the cube, but they never develop beyond indications about some kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So, the little social commentary there is feels flat and out of focus. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The performance is a purely amateur hour, the pace is slow (how much of this film consists of two nerds who watch a screen?), And the bloody effects, while they rebel, fail to convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a "Cube" fan-fic, a sloppy and sophisticated clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.
