The idea of ​​history is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution disappoints him. <br /> <br /> The film lacks rhythm, on the one hand. It should be an exciting trip, but it's slow and more than a little boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and editing. There are not enough obstacles and investments to increase the suspense, and there are scenes that do not really advance the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> Producers should have seen this in the script and insisted on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the writer and the director, obviously this is not going to happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting seems a bit flat, and that depends on the director, all the actors have to have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because with better writing, editing and direction, this could have been a great thriller.
