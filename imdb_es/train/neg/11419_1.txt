I think I've seen this kind of thing before: college graduates do not realize they have it all right, all the time, complaining that their lives suck. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bites of what I can do about this: they practically have the same plot. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this snoring festival, it was music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but, again, I never expected anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be seen with a blindfold. <br /> <br /> Now, for the verdict: it's 1 in 10.
