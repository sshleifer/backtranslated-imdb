This movie is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they launched a 19-year-old, well, probably not "to do this." There was no way they could have chosen a child of 12 or 13 as a child because the love scenes would have affected everyone (if they had been allowed to do so), as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile does not have to include many children, all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I do not really care about your education or your unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she was not up to the task. The reason given is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. It is understandable, then, that she was not thinking rationally. One hopes that he now understands his actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she is taking her medication and she is thinking clearly. <br /> <br /> Leaving that aside, Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and a perfect cast for the role.
