Before watching this movie, I read a review here that says this movie could be one of the best movies in history. ja ja scene by scene the tension grows well ... of the annoying characters of this movie. Since the girl was talking nonsense and trying to drown the child, until the killer just ran without warning (and who was the boy on the beach talking to the child?). Things seem to happen and then disappear. No answer in this movie. While I was watching it, it seemed that the film was going in one direction, so it just does not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and it goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, but the writing is horrible. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic and the reactions of the other actors / extras are simply strange. There are no solutions to the problems developed throughout the film, which makes it confusing and, ultimately, a great waste of time.
