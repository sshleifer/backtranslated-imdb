Okay, this has 2 to be one of the worst excuses, 4 a movie that I've had the misfortune to see. Like all other Olsen twins movies with the possible exception of the New York minute, this movie had no history, open plot holes, disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming, even !!!!!!!!! In case you have not guessed, I hate Mary Kate and Ashley! The only reason I saw this was because I was really bored and nothing else was on. I wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotyped movies in which they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the day while they receive the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately. The least they could do is have a 4 1 of them or make them both fall 4 of the same type. The plot in this story was so imbecile and simply silent. even a small child could see the flaws in it. Maybe they should separate and start making movies individually or maybe movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who has liked this movie was not an offense, either stupid, artificial or has not seen any really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and they just have bad cinematographic choices. Anyway, I would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good cinematic experience ... the only thing that is good 4 is a laugh cut ribs before the pathetic attempts to be cool. If you look at the laughter it's funny. Basically I give it 0 or less.
