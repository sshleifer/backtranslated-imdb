"Nada" was the most inappropriate follow-up of "Les NOces Rouges" which, in retrospect, now appears as the last good film of the golden age of Chabrol (1967-1973) "Nada" is Chabrol's first real attempt in a film totally political. his previous work "les Noces Rouges" also had political elements, but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual aspect of society in the French provinces. "Nothing" includes terrorists, ambassadors, hostage-taking, much blood, not really Chabrol A heterogeneous cast gives the film the coup de grace: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are up to the task. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("la Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is wasted as a lady (Gabrielle). The Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are horrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nothing", this is a second period of sterile inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res" before he was again at the top of his game.
