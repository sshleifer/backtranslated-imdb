I only saw this movie because I was very impressed with Olivier Mart√≠nez in SWAT. But this is not a SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and it made sense. Torero had none of this. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it could not be good, after all, the always lousy Michelle Forbes had a leading role. <br /> <br /> A poster here called incoherent movie. Another called it the worst movie in history. Both gave a lot of credit to the movie. I am very happy to have obtained it from the library for free, but I still feel cheated. <br /> <br /> IMDb must include a "0" in the "rate this movie" vote, only for movies like this one.
