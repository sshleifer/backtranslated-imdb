I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so I have no means of comparison. In addition, some years have passed, but this story did not captivate me or their romance. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are directed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out and disillusioned rock star in decline, who embarks on a romance with a fresh and talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Its dramatic success only serves to emphasize its decline. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left a great mark with me. The film is worth mentioning to me just for one aspect, Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song 'Evergreen'. She really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
