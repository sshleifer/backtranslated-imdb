I did not have high expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a small promise with its "killer cut" of "more blood, more sex!" You can not go wrong there! Well ... it goes without saying that the box is a fraud. How in the hades the actors and actresses of this caliber signed up for such a low movie? <br /> <br /> Everything opens with a drunken schoolgirl coming out of a fraternity house or some other building like that and says something. Useless junk for her boyfriend (?) as a camera in a bad steadicam follows her. Then, she is chased by a guy with a transparent plastic mask and grabbed by another. His wrists are cut without any real reason and you can see that when he was "cut" someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same theme of the girl's persecution. / Killed in a non-brutal way by two boys for about 84 more minutes. Add in a tit shot. That's Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had any problem with this movie if the box had not stolen me to rent the movie. If I rent a bad movie that says to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A full 85-minute frontal shot of a chick that is clearly androgynous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. If this is the killer cut, what is the theatrical cut? Of course, I doubt that this garbage has been put on the theaters in the first place. Shame about the actors in this movie. I could see them making their screen debut here because they have not done anything before, but they all settled down before this was released. I do not know if it was filmed before everyone was established and the studio sat in the movie until they were semi big names or not. But what I want to know is ... did they really spend $ 14 million on this movie ?!
