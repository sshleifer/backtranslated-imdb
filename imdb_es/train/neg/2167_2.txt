To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. feature that made an appearance in cable ad nasuem in the early nineties. The only notable thing about this feature was the last movie in which Duane Jones appeared. Apart from that, there's no reason to see this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-chick movies that pose as a horror movie. A tired vampire longs for love and looks for the back streets of L.A. looking for him. Will he succeed or will Vlad tremble again as he has in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must have been great because there were soon a couple of sequels. They are so bad that they make this look like a classic. I know this is a vampire movie, but the filmmakers could have gotten used to the lighting. <br /> <br /> It was not recommended by me because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
