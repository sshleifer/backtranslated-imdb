Note: I will reveal a key part of the plot, but if you have seen the cover of the DVD or any promotional material, you will already know. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old boy who is not very intelligent and who was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget about the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to be running the program in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents pursue someone whose mere contact will kill him in about a minute, they do not wear protective equipment (not even gloves). These are issues in the context of this movie. In the scientific world within this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the people in this movie do not (with some exceptions) behave like human beings do. Almost every time a character responds to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes the screenplays of soap operas look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we've lost a free movie rental with this.
