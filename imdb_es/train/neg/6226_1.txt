I shuddered throughout this movie. First, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has tried to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix." <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about this movie to be precise. Parsons 'name in the title and theft of his body is only used as a springboard for a low-budget chase movie, a flagrant attempt to get some dollars from Parsons' legacy and fan base. Gram's father had died a long time ago in 1973, the other global characters are fictitious, none of this has anything to do with Grams' life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to do it. see this movie I wish I had not done it. It is sad to see that something special is treated as such dishonorable forage. I swear I could hear Gram spinning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as Gram's representative. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this movie, he would commit suicide. On the other hand, maybe he would be afraid if he knew that this movie was going to turn out.
