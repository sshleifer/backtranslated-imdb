Since the 70s, writer / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror films. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a small budget to achieve maximum effect; Many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> A Terminator-like story about time travel and action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson play Jack Deth, a future policeman who was given the task of locating the bad guys. Whistler, who travels to the past inhabiting the body of an ancestor. Whistler is able to control other humans with his psychic powers, turning them into obedient zombies (the 'trancers' of the title), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack follows him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this sequel to 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. Having destroyed Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman. Who helped him succeed in the first movie. But, for Jack, things do not stay calm for long, and the problems appear in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build an army of transsexuals. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a big disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is hard to pick up if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there is a lot of awesome action and some deficient special effects. The ingenuity and inventiveness that made the Trancers so funny is over; instead, we get some cheesy phrases and a script that looks like it was written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give to recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast. , which has many names that will be familiar to fans of science fiction and horror films: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a "day off" while filming Trancers II, and the performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has its fans; Four more sequels have occurred since then. Unless the quality has reached a massive upward shift, I can not imagine that they are good.
