This movie is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain a second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead to the least interest in the characters or the situation. Added to that, it is a film as juvenile as anything else in recent memory. It's as if a group of high school kids 14 or 15 years old who had never met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl would have sat down and written a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what it would be like to be a man adult This movie is boring, unpleasant and, at times, offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also, it looks like twice its execution time of 85 minutes.
