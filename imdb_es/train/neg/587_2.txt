This film differs from the documentaries of the "wonder of the human body" of the stream of the mill for the courage, although in a strange way, to choose to cause displeasure in the viewer. In one scene, the camera approaches a giant 50-foot zit when a teenager squeezes pus and fluid. In another, the chamber is semi-submerged in a swamp of half-digested food and stomach acid when parts of a pasta salad fall from the esophagus and settle into the sticky substance. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a heart-rending journey through a forest of ... adolescent armpit hair. Unfortunately, I'm not inventing any of this. Watch this movie if necessary, but: bring your bag for vomit and do not eat pasta salad beforehand.
