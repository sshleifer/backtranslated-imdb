['From the beginning, you know that this is a Sam Sherman movie rather than an Al Adamson movie because, as credits accumulate, &quot;A Sam Sherman Production&quot; appears in lyrics as big as the title credit. Not only that, Mr. Sherman co-wrote the script and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone, a 69-year-old star from the old Hollywood era, to be his male protagonist in an image that Sherman thought he would capitalize on. On the recent success of &quot;Swinging Stewardesses&quot;. <br /><br /> Now, why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male protagonist in what is supposed to be a soft core exploitation feature? Challenge the explanation, but that is Sam Sherman for you. His obsession with old Hollywood gave color to many of his films for Independent International Pictures, and he and Al Adamson often tried to obtain actors for their films (for example, J. Carrol Naish, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr., etc.). ). But Bob Livingstone? Tell me that the demo of drive-in knew who was the second evaluator of this &#39;40; it&#39;s ridiculous! <br /><br /> But, again, &quot;Naughty Stewardesses&quot; was a successful image for them, so we can not write this as a Sherman fiasco. Still, by any aesthetic standard, it&#39;s an incoherent mess. Adamson wanted to get out of this picture, and it&#39;s easy to see why. First of all, it has no genre approach and moves from the super-soft core (just boobs and ass / simulated sex) to a kidnapping thriller (Steckler&#39;s &quot;Rat Pfink and Boo Boo&quot; tones!) In the middle, we are subject to painfully boring sequences of stewardesses who travel through Las Vegas with the trite music of Sparrow, or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann in a photo shoot in San Francisco. Worst of all, we have Bob Livingstone as an aspiring Jack LaLanne with a blue jumpsuit that tries to be sexy ... joke! (Fortunately, her big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was removed, but you can catch her drinking her tits on the DVD in the Special Features section.) Creepy.) <br /><br /> This is a terrible, terrible movie, but I will give it three stars for the photography of Gary Graver and for sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to do it with &quot;Wrinkles&quot; Livingstone. &quot;Naughty Stewardesses&quot; is for Al Adamson finalists and / or movie exploiters of the exploitation, since Sam Sherman&#39;s commentary offers vital inside information. Everyone else, be careful.']
