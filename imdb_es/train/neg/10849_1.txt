Normally, when I make a foray into the local Hollywood video, I head to the B-Horror movies. For me, the basic principles behind a B-Horror movie is its camping value, Heavy Gore, much unnecessary nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released their first Demo in 1995. The movie started with an interesting note and then, when I saw Dani Filth trampling an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED. When I saw the scene of lesbian sex for the sake of a lesbian sex scene, I laughed EVEN MORE HARD. I spent almost the whole movie laughing and when I did not laugh, I was shaking my head thinking about how a multimillion-dollar rock star would want to make a movie that looked like it had a budget of several hundred dollars. . The central point of this film for me seemed to appeal to "Hardcore Gothic children who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps." That was really. This movie seemed to me 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened to be satanic.This movie had great potential and it could have been really a good movie, but in the end this "Movie" is really just an extension of Cradle of Filth Video.
