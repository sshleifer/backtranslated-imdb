['This movie is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I really wanted to see &quot;Darkness falls&quot; and I thought this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I went as far as I could and I still could not get rid of the boring moments. I only envy the people who were paid to play or work on this movie. In fact, they gave them money for this shit. Is not that amazing? I mean that in this film a man dies and is cut into a wooden shredder in small bloody pieces and a few minutes later, the mother and child talk quietly at the table while nothing happens and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for those fucking movies? Oh, and the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; was lame. It was not scary at all and it was obvious that he was a boring specialist wearing a badly made make-up.']
