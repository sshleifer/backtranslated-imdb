JUDAAI was a bold film by Raj Kanwar at the time. In 1997, when a subject of this type was out of the box. <br /> <br /> To give you credit, you can show how greed changes a person and to what extent. the person can go to get what he wants <br /> <br /> However, the movie is very melodramatic, many places are ridiculous <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife. when he earns so much just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The turn is handled well, but the handling is direct from the 80s. The Johny-Paresh comedy that entertains here and there stands out like a sore thumb as it does not fit into the story. <br / > <br /> There are even several very valuable scenes <br /> <br /> The direction of Raj Kanwar is adequate, although sometimes the music is too melodramatic, but most of the songs seem forced <br /> <br /> Anil does his part well Sridevi is excellent in his part Urmila is decent Among the rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is fun, Paresh irritates Farida is decent
