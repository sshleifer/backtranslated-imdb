I'm a big fan of the book and Orwell is without a doubt my favorite writer since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of curiosity, Burton is an actor that I hold in great esteem, so when I found out he played the role of O'Brien, they kicked me out. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer on the DVD. First and some fears began to arise, especially with regard to the frankly dreadful "theme song", when listening to the Eurythmics shouting mechanically "1984!" Again and again, an electronic rhythm is as bad as it seems. <br /> <br /> The acting in general is quite good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the anguished scene of the room 101 However, here is also where the movie is disappointed. The film devotes too much time to focus on the romance between Winston and Julia, which frankly is not what Orwell was writing. I was writing about a heartbreaking future, about how Ingsoc builds a man's beliefs and then destroys them all in the name of him, who must love Big Brother. The film jumps over what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons agrees with his position in life and in the world, and his reeducation through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The comment in IMDb At this moment the states that the movie adheres to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to the Goldstien Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons, but it is mentioned almost at the end, if he has not read the book it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, that some excellent performance can not rescue. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point that Orwell was trying to make, and the sound track of the electronics is downright terrible.
