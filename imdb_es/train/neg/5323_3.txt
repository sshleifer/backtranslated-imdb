I can not believe that in the 34 previous comments, nobody mentioned that this movie is a flagrant theft of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to take an ostensibly silly blonde to the requirements of a gangster. Pistol contracted and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster stays in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment, while this is just a fluff. The transfer of tecnicolor to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling in her grave. Take a look at the paperboy. You recognize it? But, it is historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
