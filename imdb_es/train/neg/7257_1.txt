I was expecting a French musical from B-Movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche and DeFunès were superstars of the low budget French films of that era. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible 30th hour of pure mediocrity. The musical numbers are horrible, and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What song is it? This is just a succession of bad numbers, one after the other. The only weird thing about that thing is the nakedness of women. He was not familiar at that time. In fact, some numbers are there to show us topless women. It adds to mediocrity! And he tries to find the young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, in a small part as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
