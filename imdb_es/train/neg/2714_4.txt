The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC miniseries (later released to video / DVD as a feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, seen through the eyes of a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is driven by Dutton's excellent performance as Reverend Willie Taylor and uniformly spreads the story among families. However, the character of Dutton dies halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in a second half boring, incoherent and absolutely horrible. CLASSIFICATION: 4 of 10. Unclassified (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD release).
