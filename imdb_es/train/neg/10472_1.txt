I should have known that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words can not describe, nor do they do justice to how terrible this movie was. But, please, let me try to describe it: horrible acting, terrible dialogue, cheesy situations and, through all this, you have the feeling that you are being nourished by the strength of the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to try to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message. They failed miserably. Clearly it was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
