When you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to throw up in a hairball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've seen most, if not all of his films, but it was the first time I saw this one. Modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love. There are few films that handle the despair of love, as openly or as openly as Modern Romance, although Chilly Scenes of Winter of 1979 is very close. Basically, both deal with obsessed men who are too attracted / obsessed psychologically with their respective women. <br /> <br /> When Chilly Scenes of Winter skirts the theme of stalking, this film has a more rooted base in the subject. of love because both people are already in a relationship ... and they are out of the relationship ... and again in it. <br /> <br /> And since it's a movie that was released in 1981, it's your time in terms of styles and such. That's the main reason why I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is "If it sucks, at least, it may have some historical relevance", you know what happens in the time capsule. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the horrible scenes of Albert Brooks shirtless. <br /> <br /> Man is hair. Very hair Like I was wearing a black sweater with curly hair, hairy. And what is worse is that it is almost burned by the hairy victim. It is not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on. In the early 1980s, furry men were seen as normal and not at all shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like this is simply disgusting. I'm sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone would say "hey let's try this scene but with a simple shirt, I mean you can scare people". It's really bad and I feel sorry for the poor and pretty actress who had to deal with the naked body of Albert Brooks on top of his. She was probably pulling the hairs out of her teeth for days after that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a good movie. It could have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that would forever contaminate the visualization of this movie.
