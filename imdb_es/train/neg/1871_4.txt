Despite the luxurious production numbers and the wonderful costumes, this film is a task to watch. The murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle for assembling musical numbers, but it often makes the process stop in astonishing way as well as not being very immersive. Although obviously a lot of money has been spent on them, the numbers are poorly organized and poorly photographed. Obviously it is a precoded movie because girls often wear very little clothes and there is even a song that sings the praises of marijuana. The performances are all of a single note, although it's good to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as the police lieutenant, appears for the umpteenth time looking for clues, you may want to throw in the towel or less advance to the next number. Pity to the bosses who got stuck in the cinema at its release though!
