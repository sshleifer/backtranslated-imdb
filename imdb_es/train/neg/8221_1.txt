This "movie" tries to follow the genre of low-budget hand-held films that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This, it fails and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "prizes" that this piece of garbage has stuck on the cover ... makes you wonder what these critics were when they actually presented this ... <br /> <br /> The words do not describe how absolutely appalling this movie is. Seriously, IT IS THE BAD. <br /> <br /> I saw it in 20 minutes without stopping, in a fast almost continuous advance. <br /> <br /> From garbage lighting to frightful direction, grainy images to muffled sound, and of course, not forgetting the ABISMA performance, this was a completely pathetic piece of so-called filming. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it does NOT have redeeming qualities, at all. Save your money and watch a decent low-budget horror movie; There are many out there: Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name just a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this garbage at all costs. DO NOT waste your money or your time on this piece of trash pretending to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to all the other comments! You have been warned!
