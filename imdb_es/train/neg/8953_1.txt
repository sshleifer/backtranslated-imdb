I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe it was a neutral or very stupid idea. I think it was the last. First, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was that, during Winston's day-to-day work, conversations, meals in the cafeteria, etc., he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances to people without immense fear. . One of the most important parts of the book was that, even in small activities, it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of your true emotions on your face AT ANY TIME. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. In the book, Winston knew that this was a great risk to wander around and was skeptical and scared on each trip. While in the film, you do it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy vigilance and risk yourself immediately. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies include Winston hiding his diary on the wall, Yes, a very small change, but he raises the question, what is the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is the morphing of the characters. <br /> <br /> However, the big inaccuracies were much more disturbing. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent but crude philosophy. In the movie, they skip that and go directly to make you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a certain sense, when it is addressed with his fascism, but if that is all that is obtained from Big Brother, the point of the book is really lost. What scares Big Brother is that, in a way, he has some points behind his philosophy. When O'Brien is thinking about Winstons in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he hears and advances in his philosophy is, in fact, the most spooky and intriguing. In the end, (carefully SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the frightening thing is that he is not sure it was the beating and the torture that caused this, or the real power behind the philosophy. By no means am I saying that Big Brother philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how could someone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the movie? It was horrible, without any connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that brought the book was the thought of Winstons on O'Brien BEFORE he got in touch with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. <br /> <br /> But that sums up why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible NOT to jump the gun and transform the characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think that this movie could be seen if it was less than two hours? At a minimum, the movie requires 3 hours to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is simply useless. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, and I want to say that you really adored it, you will not pass this movie, and most likely you already knew that you would not. Because the book can not be filtered, and this movie just shows how impossible it is to put something decent in a small roll of film. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
