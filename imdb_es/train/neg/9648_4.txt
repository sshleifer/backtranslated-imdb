Vipul Shah has done a really impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. "Waqt - The Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His last appearance as a filmmaker 'London Dreams' appears when their careers are the weakest. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a mediocre story, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. Okay, it has the potential, but when you see 'London Dreams' you wonder what's going on? This movie has perhaps the worst climax of recent times. Vipul Shah, the writer, knocks down Vipul Shah, the director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; But again the climax is horrible. How can someone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I will not do it Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and apologize to his diaper partner, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he arrives in India, instead of slapping or abusing him, Salman receives him with the low band and says it was the reason behind the whole fiasco. Was it Vipul Shah's intention to show the character of Salman as a GOD? If so, then you have completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that, would he welcome a person who destroyed him with such a good reception? Write what you feel, do not deceive us (the audience), we are sensible enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Although Salman is excellent. He takes the film on his shoulders and does it really well in the emotional scenes. But once again, his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him seem retarded at the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman has overcome it completely. Asin is wasted, and what makes a great talent like Om Puri in this movie? Rannvijay hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Bring Parekh is fine as a vampire. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream is still a dream!
