In the recent move to bring Asian films to the United States, this is the last film that should be released here. Being a big fan of Asian films of all genres, I was surfing the net and I found this to re-launch in the US market. UU., So I decided to check it out early and rent it from a local video store. <Br /> <br /> Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water. Jet Li would fall asleep watching the fight sequences. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, it would be better if you go with a Jackie Chan movie! <br /> <br /> Also, you think you're going to see martial arts with a girl involved in revenge for the death of her parents, but surprised! A good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogue, an absence of action, the lack of development of a tangent plot, almost NOTHING to do with the premise to which we are exposed. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the child, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director did not spend time on the restructuring and, nevertheless, dedicated a part of the film to drag the problem. It would have been much better if they had shortened that full hour and developed the story itself through another film and focused on the aspect of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I really do not think that Iron Monkey's Choreographer did the action sequence on Princess Blade. I was completely insulted by the frequent use of slow motion and rapid camera changes to portray the physical speed of the murderers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you PLEASE do not waste your time / money with this movie. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer might even tempt you, but I'm sure this movie is NOT suitable for the audience (maybe in Japan but not in the United States) and it will be the worst movie brought to the states of the Asian movie . industry.
