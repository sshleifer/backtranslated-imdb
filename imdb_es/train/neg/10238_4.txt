This movie seemed like it was good at first, but it never met their expectations. The director has talent and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story to accompany her. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explicable and interesting angle. Basically, the movie never fits into the explanation of press releases. The performance was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as he always is. It is a pity that I have chosen to make such a weak film.
