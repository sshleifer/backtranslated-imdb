Richard Dreyfuss is, in fact, in this movie, but in a rather small part. It is NOT the "obsessed" filmmaker, it is the business manager / accountant of the group. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless one uses the term "erotic" quite imprecisely. I would not have considered watching the movie without Richard Dreyfuss being an important character. However, I could have realized that the famous 1960s anthem, "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen was an artistic influence. Apart from the short recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses", and an interesting visual reference of the end of "The Seventh Seal" by Ingmar Bergman, I thought it was a poor attempt to combine symbolic elements and moods immortalized in movies like "Last year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric artistic company, there are many superior films, ranging from "Bye, Bye, Brazil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
