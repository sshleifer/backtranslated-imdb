Wow. I thought this might be tasteless, but it was even worse than I imagined. Sometimes I like to see a good "car shock" movie: those that are so bad that you can not look the other way because you want to see how bad they can be. This is really the only reason why I could leave the television on: the morbid fascination. It was not so much the performance, that it was just mediocre or a little worse than you would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot that should never have seen the light of day. The script, too, is inductive. Regarding cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a "curtain drawing" device, like in an old TV show from the 1950s ... but without irony? At first I thought they should be joking, but the film takes the fact that I used it in an ironic way too seriously. Do not even ask me about the score ... the only highlight is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people something for their $ 8 ... I'm glad I saw it on TV! Only fool! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding a lot of work recently. I suppose if you do not wait too long, and you want to see a thriller with no sense, it would be better to spend an afternoon trimming your toenails, so it deserves a 2.
