Frank Capra's creativity must have been exhausted when this movie was made. While it has some charming moments and many wonderful artists, the total recycling of Capra not only from the script, but also from a considerable amount of its first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is frankly of poor quality. It is understandable that he reuses the images of the horse race, which is exciting. But he uses full dialogue scenes with minor actors, then returns with those actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older. Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip this and look at the Broadway bill.
