This movie is one of the most bad and involuntary action movies ever filmed. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but adds to the mix an action of friends and very cheesy, an eccentric and exaggerated villain, a secondary plot of love interests and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have recovered from the small suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their lives and, until they saw "Showdown", they had never thought about committing suicide with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to the male genitalia, and not for the women, either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact, before going on a wave of suicides, Brandon tells Dolphy: "In case we do not, I want to tell you that they have the greatest d .. Have I ever seen. " <br /> <br /> Now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION movie no less? And you want your words to be moribund? <br /> <br /> Further on, there is a gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (with respect to the villain): "I would like to cut certain parts of his anatomy". Brandon: "Man, you have a fixation." <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com pointed out: "Unfortunately, Dolph does not respond with 'Do I have a fixation? Do I have a fixation?! You are the one I decided that your last words should be about my privates I was going to cut off his ears and nose, man. "<br /> <br /> This is a relentlessly stupid thing and a lot of fun if you're someone who likes receiving root canals from dentists without a license, without novocain. It's on par. Great fun for the whole family!
