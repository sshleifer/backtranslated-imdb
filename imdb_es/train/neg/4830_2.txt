REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a political war movie you will be noticed, but this movie was just trash. Horrible in every way. Terribly inaccurate in many ways. I find it easier to believe that the president of the United States is getting ready, flying a fighter plane and bringing down the aliens. It is easier to notice the few things that were right. I was speechless when I saw someone say that this movie was the best one in the last 25 years. I was overexcited, seemingly mindless detours from the plot, and had sometimes questionable cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities? Did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you have to do a lot of research, it's only been five years before this movie came out. I am a veteran of the Iraq war and if I were to spend ONE day with an infantry squad or an EOD squad, I would realize how B.S. this movie is to compare this with Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why do not you throw Commando and Red Dawn there, too? I think those could be more precise. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see beyond the incredible plot, the historical and objective discrepancies, then this movie could be fine. Nothing more. If you keep hearing "Oscar buzz", and you have to add your own pompous criticism, go ahead. As for me, I'm writing to the director to see if I can recover my 131 minutes.
