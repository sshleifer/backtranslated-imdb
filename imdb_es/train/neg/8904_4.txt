Personally I liked "The Prophecy" of 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the film was not impeccable, it was a spooky and very original Horror / Fantasy movie that entertained greatly. This lower sequel to 1998 is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. In my opinion, Walken is one of the best actors in the world, and once again he is outstanding in the role of the fallen Arc√°ngel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between the fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to avoid the birth of a child, namely, the son of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could be the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said before, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. However, in addition to Gabriel, "The Prophecy II" also includes a lot of terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was quite annoying, and Danayel bothered me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who did not shut up. Still, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the movie. The whole movie is quite lugubrious and is well filmed in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The scene of Gabriel's resurrection in the beginning is also quite impressive, and one of the best moments in any of the films of "The Prophecy". "The Prophecy II" is, however, the weakest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken show for a single man, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
