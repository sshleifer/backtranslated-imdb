A true movie blowout literally. This British movie is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terrorist places bombs on a train. How could the writers and producers of this stench turn this into such a boring story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as the expert called to deactivate the bomb, receives horrible writing material to work on. Naturally, just when they call him, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave. No wonder we've never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a movie, it would be enough to finish his career. <br /> <br /> That old man who loved trains and interferes is our version of senile dementia from 1953. I thought it was very insulting to show this man, even at the end.
