After Highlander 2 (which I'm still in denial), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was very bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with the details of the computer and the details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS, except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she has seen the original movie. The acting is not even convincing. Please, save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and can not turn it off. This movie will ruin your life
