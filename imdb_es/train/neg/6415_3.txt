This was, by far, the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. It was slow, boring, without fear, or funny, or dramatic, or entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar lived up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else in the image. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that Grudge was 'quite good', then do not go see this unless you enjoy wasting your time and your life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this movie for free, so I do not want this to look like a tirade from a guy who lost $ 8 in a terrible movie. It was free, it still stunk, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
