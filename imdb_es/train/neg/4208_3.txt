There is a very good movie lurking just below the surface of the layers on the layers of cheese that is "the Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I discovered this when I saw this again this morning after having neglected it for years and years. I remember that I hated it with passion when it first came out, but this time, I found that the special effects are pretty good. The plot is just "the endless story" with a creativity endectomy, but it's a good movie for anyone who just wants a really impressive candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a little more surreal than the norm. I give him a grade of three, since * I * would give him two (only for parody) if I had ever decided to watch this movie waiting to be totally surprised by my story.
