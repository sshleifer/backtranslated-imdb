Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hated "September 11". This movie was, in general, bad. With the exception of the Alejandro González Iñárritu segment, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, the short films were, at best, boring and, at worst, offensive. The worst thing in my mind was the pretentious segment of Youssef Chahine in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers with American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest that suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause. The segment was completely off topic and, considering Chahine's apparent lack of decency, a waste of my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film with their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was insipid.
