The Comeback begins with a promising aspect, with a brutal death scene in charge of a mask that uses a killer. The mask itself is also great, and looks almost identical to the one used in the movie "Granny" of the nineties. From then on the movie is mostly boring. We have some more deaths, which in turn are good, but there are not enough. The reason why the deaths are so good is because they are frantic and bloody. The story behind the film is quite interesting and would have worked very well if it had not been so boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this unless you are an intransigent collector: there is not enough here to make it an average killing movie.
