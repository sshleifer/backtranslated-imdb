This movie was one of the best movies ever made, it had everything to make a movie great. Amazing performance, awesome special effects ... oh wait, I must be thinking about a good movie. Well, this was not one of them, it just sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of head bone would think that this movie was a 10. When I cast my vote, there were 206 out there, God knows what happens in your head. Now, as for any other vote, an 8 or 9 was even too high, but a 10? Come on, what made this movie so good to give it a 10? I know these are the same ones who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
