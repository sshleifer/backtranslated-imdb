Because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you start? In a b * tchiness channel, I'll start with the horrible performance of almost everyone in this movie. Scratch that. It almost does not belong to that phrase. I can not think of a single character that has been well represented. Although, to be fair, it would be almost impossible to represent these zero-dimensional characters successfully. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I do not include on purpose, I'm pretending she does not exist) is still one of the worst actors I've seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was horrible of God. He tried to reflect the brilliance that was the first, but failed in many ways. Almost all the parts were useless, although I must admit (reluctantly) that the plot was quite good, it's a surprise. And the ending was at least slightly humorous. But this movie is among the worst I've seen. Do not look at it. Simply no. There is absolutely no value in seeing it. Any. It only takes away the enjoyment of the first.
