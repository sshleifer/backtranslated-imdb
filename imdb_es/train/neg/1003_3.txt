Ok I'm not Japanese I know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Apart from that, I'm Spanish, like paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with that set point, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea how it's nice for the Japanese Audiences, Mamoru Oshii is a good director, despite things postmodernly too pedantic in style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting, and I'm surprised he discovered this. It may just be one of those cases of lost translation, I'm afraid so, but as a European viewer watching the movie with captions of overloaded English subtitles, I thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked (I mean, give a break to the audience and shut up a bit, damn narrator) to the point of almost making my head explode by an excess of accelerated language and an absurd action. br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really great. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the sweetness of the eyes ends as soon as the characters are set aside to begin with an endless funny speech about all the still images. It just makes you want to move quickly to the next scene of hysterical characters cut out. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is actually planning a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Maybe the second part will show the good parts of this first and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it is more and more narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought that Talking Head was dense, the amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will hit you. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless for the Japanese, maybe it was a really funny movie lost in cultural borders and translation. Perhaps.
