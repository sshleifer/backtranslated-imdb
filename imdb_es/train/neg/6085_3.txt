In this potboiler driven by paranoia, our hero reporter fights authorities, duplicated co-workers, renegade OVNI rebels and silent and hidden aliens. (Although he is able to mentally control objects and zap from a distance, three of them are needed to operate a control panel of approximately two dozen buttons). The script clomps from event to event, leaving the puzzles in abundance. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they are only patrolling an empty landing site? And what types of spaces are worth the moon cheese kidnaps first the ugly photographer instead of his model? Inquisitive minds want to know! Writer and director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his subject by flipping through a stack of UFO-themed tabloids while taking on a double feature of Sunn Classics. (Screening of the closing screen boasting that it is based on real events ... as in "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by the abrupt end, but they should still appeal to the traps of conspiracy .
