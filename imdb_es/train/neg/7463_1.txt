I promised long ago NEVER, NEVER watch a movie that has SOMEONE who has ALWAYS been a regular member of the "Saturday Night Live" cast. I did not rent "Corky Romano", but my good manners forced me to see him for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Tedious, not hilarious. Bad, not good. That's all I can say about this video.
