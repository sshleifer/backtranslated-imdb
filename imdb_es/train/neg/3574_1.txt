I just could not finish this movie. I disconnected after what I would say is my nomination for the most miserable attempt for the prize for sexual suggestion: a scene in which Pia Zadora, in a picnic, is between two children who love her. One (the good boy) begs him to see the error in his ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if he would like a hot dog, which he then offers. At the crotch level. I hope not to spoil anything to say that he turns around and takes the hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
