Friday 13 step more! Officially there is a movie worse than your hateful series. I won this movie in a contest at the university, and it was a waste of money even if it was free. Jack Jones plays a truly horrible singer whose attempt to find some murderers or something like that. At least on Friday thirteen I never got bored. I'd rather take my nails than see this again.
