This movie is one of those that I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life in which I will never enter again. The premise is really interesting: it's essentially a zombie movie from the perspective of the undead (do not split the hairs as to whether we're really dead or not.) Unfortunately, they do not offer a compelling story within this framework. unbearable of the lives of the central characters can increase the realism of the film, but it stinks all the value of entertainment. If they had put a little more effort to maintain the interest of the viewer, they would have been much more likely to take home the social commentary .
