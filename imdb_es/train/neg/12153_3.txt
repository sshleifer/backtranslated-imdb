Feeding The Masses was just another movie that tries to earn some money from the zombie craze that is happening, mainly due to the popularity of films like Land of the Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a television station, which is guarded by the army, and is reporting that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to containment and that the city will soon have the freedom to do it again business. The problem is that this is totally false. Zombies run rampant and only a small minority of people know it. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the cameraman, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the main anchor (who for some reason is included in the role of Shelly on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), his military escort. Torch and Sherry are against lying to people, but the station is in charge of a secret service (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This movie gives a pat on the back to the cover of the box that says "We keep FEEDING THE MASSES on a level higher than any of the three films 'of the Dead' by George A. Rombero " The source of that quote has lost ALL the credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean anything bad as I expected more (although, obviously, I was), but I want to say something bad in the sense that I could not find any redeeming features in the movie, at all. The acting in all parts is too much made or too much wood. Did anyone remember your lines or are you reading from the reference cards? I can not even think about what was the best part of the movie or the best actress / actress. There really was not one. If I had to nod to someone, I would say that Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but it does not really say much. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend it to broadcast this movie. , even though the cover of the box looks pretty good (that's what originally attracted me to the movie). 3/10
