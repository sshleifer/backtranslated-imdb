A lot of promise and nothing more. A star cast certainly by Hong Kong standards, but man, oh man, this is a stinker. No history Okay, the action will make up for it like most of HK's action movies. What? Is the action terrible, cheesy and scant? The releases of Dragon Dynasty up to this point are, in general, excellent and generally considered as classics in Asian cinema. This is a plague. They managed to dispute a couple of Infernal Affairs actors, but they can not give life to a disconnected script. There are dialogue scenes in which two or three lines are spoken with a cut between each one and there is no continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel as if each one is giving an ordinary monologue and simply ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a double double? No way. If way Stay away.
