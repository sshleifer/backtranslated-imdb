I did not expect much from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but surely I expected more than I got. A single-line user commentary (second-rate action movie) did not strike me as too disparaging for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered to see this movie if its rating was lower than 5.0, but hey, the movie had a score of 5.9 out of 10, which I found quite acceptable for this type of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of people who rated this movie with a 10 (excellent) was clearly a publicity stunt because DETENTION is the usual Nu Image trash you've seen before, again and again . <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince when a former soldier converted a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His performance is simply terrible, emotionless and artificial. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquent children. Either they are great actors or, compared to Lundgren, they seem great actors, simply because they seem natural and credible. <br /> <br /> The DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie. for high security weekend high school, four teenagers in detention with a veteran war teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in, but the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it THE PANIC ROOM? is full of incredible situations, many clichés and stereotyped characters.And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a couple of Bonnie and Clyde in love and they offer the most acceptable performances of the film, although it seems like a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a mistress of Milla Jovovich In a film where everything fails, her madness and style provided enough fresh air to keep my interest from falling ground zero.
