This movie was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for a number of minutes, I wondered when the movie was going to start. All configurations were in place; A typical love story, the characters have to overcome their gifts, the villain has to emerge, but none of them ever started. At the time these things happened, I was already bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and accumulation, it felt as if the necessary frames had been cut. Children's things do not have to be that way. Movies for children can be as fascinating as those for adults. The excuse, "hey, is for children", is bull. I will take "Sword on the stone" any day. This was terrible. I get the feeling that Disney will get something out these days. And as for the children, the 10 years with which I saw this will coincide ... pure garbage.
