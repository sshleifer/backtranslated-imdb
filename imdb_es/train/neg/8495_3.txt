I am the kind of person who went down to the local library and read books about Babbage's differential engine while my schoolmates played football, etc. So, if there's something like a target audience for this movie, I think it's probably included in that. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to see it again. A previous critic mentioned not watching this movie when he was tired. Maybe that was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I did the best I could to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects that I like, but in general I found them to be amateurs and quite industrious. <br /> <br /> Being something of a confessed computer nerd, I can not help but grasp the exact time frame in which the film was made, and how the graphics used reflect that time (ie, 1997). ). Having played games of the c.f. "Mind Grind" to cite an example, this film can not escape the low resolution multimedia explosion in 16-bit color of that era. Now, fortunately, this has decreased a bit in recent years in the gaming world, at least in favor of the real game. <br /> <br /> Having to resort to watching this movie through a German FTA satellite channel (as I do not) I think it was ever aired on UK FTA TV, well, not recently, anyway, I was a little surprised to see the final credit note. Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on its design. It may be entertaining for me to have fun with this, given that ten years have passed since the film was made, however, the end result makes the movie graphics of the eighties look good in comparison. <br /> <br /> But, as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a film without the angle of science fiction, and a more direct biographical approach might be more appropriate to cover the life story of this remarkable lady. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First, the underlying idea that, somehow, real-world information lost from the past can be reconstructed accurately by some kind of extrapolation through software-based smart agents, it seems somehow ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In addition, the theme extends through the movie that a computer device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg winds) now it is known that it is not the case. <br /> <br /> Good, so the Victorians may have maintained this opinion. , but GÃ¶del works of the twentieth century that show that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, have completely undermined these ideas, which They seem to be fundamental to the way that today's researchers are supposed to work the software. <br /> <br /> Finally, the click of the mouse in the air to indicate "programming" is also simply wrong, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This movie might have been fine, but at least some technique. However, the scientific consultation would have given the film a much-needed credit in terms of credibility. <br /> <br /> However, I will not forget the movie, because, like "Pi", it is clearly a unique work, but also many fatal errors so that I really enjoy it, 3/10 on my part.
