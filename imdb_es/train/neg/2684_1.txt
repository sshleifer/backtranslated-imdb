I found the offensive film for Americans who lost someone in the towers, for Americans in general. Pretending to be a tribute to the horrible events that have taken place in recent years, each director takes the opportunity to argue with old events (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), or to criticize the political behavior of the Americans, or to compare different political situations as they have done themselves. This country has nothing to do or share with the atrocity of September 11. Shame on them.
