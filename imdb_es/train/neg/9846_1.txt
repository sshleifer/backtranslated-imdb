You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most useless movies ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. Even the film industry recognized that it was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. It's a wonder that it has ever been put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract caused Sellers to be in this movie. I also wonder why the people responsible for this movie were allowed to continue doing other bad movies. Surely this movie is a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of time for someone to see it. Surely there are high school students who could write / produce a movie as an argument.
