This is a film in which all the actors are well, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film in which each of the three couples is in a situation that feels forced to be cute or to put the story in motion . In other words, it feels like they are scenes from invented movies, not like real life. Even if women who work in peep parlors ever date one of their clients, it just does not seem realistic in the way it is written in this movie. Also, when one of the characters encounters the overweight woman in the movie, it feels artificial, the way they look at each other a few seconds after arguing. Again, all the actors are good, and the moments of this movie are nice, but in general, another indie that could have used some rewriting before the production started to roll.
