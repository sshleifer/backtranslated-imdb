A lot of "Over Her Dead Body" is so painfully funny that I really writhed in my seat out of shame for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can not bring a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and more, that she really does not have any comical moment. She is irritated and annoyed like a ghost returning to earth to prevent a kitchen psychic from going out with her promised widower. The groom is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and without charm, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing to the film any anemic energy he has. I am very sorry for Bell, as he seems to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately, she faces the unsurpassed task of making any film that shows Jason Biggs tolerable, and is dragged by the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic." <br /> <br /> "Over Her Dead Body" actually confused me, due to its laziness and absolute lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can not be financed because large amounts of money are turning into bland garbage like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do you think the audience is going to the movies? <br /> <br /> Rating: F
