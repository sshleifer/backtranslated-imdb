WOW! <br /> <br /> I just received this movie from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and felt it had been taken away! It is more than boring, most scenes are recorded in front of a green screen, the performance is something improvised, almost as if they did not have a script. The Martians are CGI, which seems to have been made by a novice or a film produced by Fan. I can not stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, the Martians are torturing a local captive woman. It passes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally remarkable, and when you kill her, you can see she's a computer figure, it looks like a game in 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like the Plague! You can download two trailers from your site and see how scary it really is!
