My Take: A tired formula Christmas comedy. The laughter is tired and the talents behind it are too. <br /> <br /> I love vacations as much as the next guy (even if I often have a bad case of holiday blues), but it seems like it's just a dump for a bunch of Holiday comedies that would be Bad movies on any day of the year, but that does not make them any less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * gulp * we still have), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with the Disney franchise SANTA CLAUSE (except the sometimes rude humor and the "Little" Helper of Santa Claus with a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a premise of a joke that lasts for 116 minutes . Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does he go? <br /> <br /> It's a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have turned it into a fun Christmas comedy that will probably fade along with the snow, but it would have been much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe that he is really the lost brother of the aging Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), who invites you to visit his good brother. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and what is worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep an eye on Santa Claus, and his ESTO is close to being closed. Jah And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's assistant, Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend. IF I do not know if I would praise the casting or hit him. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are given very little to work with. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could find is Santa's brother. being its exact opposite and some joke about an elf DJ. I must admit that I had some giggles in which Fred attended a counseling group for famous brothers (who were joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. Worse yet, the film even succumbs to sentimentality that is supposed to make us feel "right" and teaches us a lesson about "what Christmas really means." Apparently, what Christmas means to Hollywood is to get as much of our surplus money as possible for Christmas shopping. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
