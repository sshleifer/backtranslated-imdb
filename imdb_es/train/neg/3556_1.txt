You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of at full speed in a movie, and "The Incubus" is the worst and worst scenario of a great actor who goes through the motions to pay the bills. . In fact, observing the hammy script and the 'baroque' art direction of John Hough, one can hardly blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape murders that happened in a small town, with lots of mixed supernatural hokum. Somehow, the management manages to absorb the tension and interest of each scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly PO 'Ed sometimes. The Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well-made creation, but it is not worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> 1/10
