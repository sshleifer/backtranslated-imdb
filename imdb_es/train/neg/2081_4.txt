This movie is shown again and again on the cable lately, so ... <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women to fight over Luke Wilson or the equally vicious 'villian' in this movie. The actresses are very nice, and that is the only reason to see this movie. I guess it's "funny" that Luke is an even uglier / stupid / stupid friend, but hey, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the protagonists would ever do it, NEVER talk to any of the Los machos in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is crying and crying and fighting, and so on to the 2 guys that were best described on Friday the 13th, dead. * @ $ #
