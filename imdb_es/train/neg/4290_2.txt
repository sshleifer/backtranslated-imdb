I will give this film two stars because it is full of beautiful photographs. Otherwise, it is full of clich√©s and stereotypes: mountaineers are white nonsense of the fanatically religious or racist class, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move without making noise, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds at great distances. And so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I asked myself what was the purpose of the film (apart from showing me beautiful images of mountains, log cabins, forests, a variety of animals, free-living mountain people and weird people in the church). <br /> <br /> The plot touched a whole range of themes but did not explore any of them in depth. This was neither a story about growing up during the depression, nor about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity. He tried to be all those things and more, which made him superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film was supposed to be about Little Tree education, we learn almost nothing about it. They gave him a brief summary of the history of his people (who was brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; He tried to cut wood (in which he failed) and whiskey (literally); He learned to read (and maybe write) with the help of his grandmother and his dictionary, and that was it. Apparently, he did not learn much during his stay at the boarding school because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, Graham Greene's grandmother and grandfather made sure that in the end Little Tree would become a spiritual person whose main goal as an adult, later, and paraphrasing here, "to mount with the Navajos "and" getting trapped in a couple of wars ", was" reaching "the grandmother and grandfather and the character of Graham Greene in the sky (instead of, say, going out with girls, getting married, having children or other nonsense) <br /> <br /> Last, but not least, I must say that I found offensive offensive to Grandpa. Why of all things had to be a whiskey yet? To counteract the stereotype of the "drunken Indian"?
