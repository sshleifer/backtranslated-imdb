I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I've just seen makes all of his direct releases to videos in recent years look like their hits from the early 90's in comparison. <br /> <br /> A secret bio laboratory is creating a new type of drug that increases speed. human adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something like that. Somehow, Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or it's the end of the world ... or something like that. Seagal also went through success squads as jellybeans, every time I look up he was in charge of a new face, so it's a bit difficult to follow the development of the character, so I know that Steven's atma keeps him from screaming with all the strength, but even so, why? Are you constantly being nicknamed by people who do not look anything like him? In general, the sequences of the plot and the action of the films can avoid it being a total loss of time, but this was not even close. As I said, it was more a horror movie with a lot of blood and stabbing instead of fighting directly. The problem was that it was not really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have light movement speed, but the 40-year-old, 280 pounds. Did Seagal kill them all with one hand? I guess the highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes that new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
