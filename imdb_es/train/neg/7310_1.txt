** SPOILERS DOWN !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever has my nod to the worst movie of the year ... I've seen. This movie is straight from TRASH! There are so many wrong things in the movie that you can not help it, but be surprised at how bad it really is. This movie had a lot of potential to be good, but in the end it did not do anything. The characters were as stupid as one can be; for the whole movie you're just wondering "why would you do that?" or "what is your point of doing this?" ... so illogical and stupid are the characters. We have no history in them, so, naturally, you really do not give the rats the money of their destiny ... you could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The 'whore' (Marcy) for example ... was she so horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? It did not make sense that ... it's almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give him the virus so fast! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would anyone really go to the forest and drink tap water from a cabin without looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert shoot the sick man? from the beginning? The movie would have ended that way ... besides, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the booth, even if they had to? walk? 'No, I'll just wait until two of my friends are infected (one of them one step away from death) to finally choose to get out of there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish outside the Hermit's body, only to fall into the contaminated reservoir and become infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an acquaintance of these idiots. I do not think there was a worse ending to a movie. At first, the children asked the cashier of the sucking shop what the rifles were for, and he replied that "it is for the blacks". At the end of the film, 3 young black men (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) enter the shop ... they come to discover that the cashier was cleaning them to be used for hunting. THEN, proceeds to give them all the pounds and handshakes and jokes with them as if they were their friends at home. <br /> <br /> Okay, ¿¿¡¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿WHAT WAS THE POINT? How insipid can one be, what were the filmmakers thinking when they put that in the movie? I, as a black man, of course was offended by the initial comment of 'Nigger'. It was a comment without flavor, without meaning. My question to the filmmakers: what was the ending point with the black children? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made before? To soften things with black viewers, making a joke of that? Well, for my part, I did NOT find that pathetic attempt at funny humor in the least. The whole movie was a joke ... a pathetic attempt to make movies that should not be given at the time of day. Did Peter Jackson really think that this movie was so good? What movie was he watching? <br /> <br /> ZERO * of **** stars .... if I could give you a lower rating, I would. Please, IMDb partners, do not waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a "movie". This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
