Thank God! I did not waste my money when renting it but I downloaded it! This is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life, with visual effects, unnecessary gore and naked! Away from other zombie films like The Night of the Living Dead and others. There are a lot of loop holes and errors in the movie. Okay, if you get time after reading this comment, check the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I have a self-explanation of why the film is like that, I mean that each film directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to look for what kind of films are directed by him, but I can finish all this by saying a strong prayer. Even for fun or over time or even in an extremely boring situation, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
