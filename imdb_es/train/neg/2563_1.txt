This movie was on television the other day and I did not enjoy it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... completely horrible. The new actor and actress to play the lead roles was not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name), so this movie gets 0 out of ten degrees, not A movie that you can sit, watch and enjoy, this is a movie that you turn to another channel or take it back to the store if you hired it or bought it. It was good to see Ape, the monkey back, but it was not as fun as the first, they should have had the new George as the son of Georges grown up, and he still had Bredon and (what's his face) in the movie, that would be "I've been a little better than I was.
