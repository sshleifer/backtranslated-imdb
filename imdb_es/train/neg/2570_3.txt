I read that "There's a girl in my soup" came out during the low period of Peter Sellers. Watching the movie, it does not surprise me. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Apparently, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; It does not The whole movie seems like they just filmed at random what happened without having to write anything. I may not have seen all the movies about middle-aged or older people trying to be hippies, but this one gives these movies a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> In general, both Sellers and Hawn have starred much better films than this, so do not waste your time on this. Fairly worthless.
