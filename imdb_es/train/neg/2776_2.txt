The King Maker is a film about a series of real events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and the art direction are praiseworthy, the film still does not impress the viewer. The performance, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are struggling to drop the tears and the accents, both real and false, are extremely irritating. The plot was also too stupid and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture that kind of real, centennial air, and it was more like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> The last word? The costumes and the art direction give the film a fresh air, but the execution was extremely bad and the actors could not even give natural bursts of emotion. In short, the movie sounded more like a hullabaloo than a script.
