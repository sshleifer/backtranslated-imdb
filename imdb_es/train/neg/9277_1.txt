I saw the omen when I was 11 on television. I enjoyed the trilogy. So when I did not have the opportunity to see one at the movies, I did not let it go. I entered the cinema knowing that what I was about to see was not a movie premiere, but a movie for television. However being a fan I could not resist. But this Omen movie that I saw in a midnight screening did not bring chills, it provoked laughter. Stable dialogue as "it is written that if a baby cries during the baptism, they reject God". What nonsense. There are no decent pieces. Faye Grant so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. However, I laughed out loud on several occasions because of how bad it was. Truly pathetic.1 out of 10
