BRIEF ENCUENTRO is an awful and pointless remake of David Lean's 1945 classic, which was based on the play "Still Life" by Noel Coward. A doctor removes a particle of sand from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, a happily married social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance on another occasion, form an instant attraction and meet every Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize that they have no realistic chances of happiness and agree to separate. The original work of an act of Coward referred to two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are not anyone's idea of ​​"ordinary people". Loren, in particular, is a mistake: Sophia Loren is completely made up, looks like a million dollars, and works as a part-time volunteer social worker in a Citizens Advice Bureau. Burton, who looks emaciated, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, does not present himself as an average general practitioner. That said, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends his nights writing poisonous reviews and treats his husband with total disdain. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, works as a potter in the house all day and is extremely bored: the most exciting thing he has done is almost having an adventure six years ago. Their final scene together will cause nausea, ("You've been far, far away," etc.). That great British actor, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute cameo as Burton's friend, and seems to be slightly drunk, speaking his sentences in a barely audible voice. It is a sad and forgettable performance in a disgusting and terrible review of a film classic. Avoid at all costs.
