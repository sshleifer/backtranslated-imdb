Oh, man, how the low series had come down like in 1952! This boring thing is precisely the kind of series that annoyed Annie Wilkes (of Misery). Not only do the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that were not in the previous chapter (and that COULD NOT be there, tell me that when enemies explode the plain in episode 7 to 8, they would not see the characters jump), but I think that this series has the world record of footage. I mean, most of it is archival material! And not just from other series (apparently, all the flight sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the great scenes of "melted rocks" from episodes 2 to 3 are from Captain Marvel's Adventures), but from themselves ! The entire sequence of the "trip to the Moon" (which is probably the shortest, lasts 30 seconds and the characters never seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) episode 1 is repeated in episode 8. And episode 10 is ALL the scenes of previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K did not do episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9, so they did not have to do everything again!). <br /> <br /> Do not understand me. started in the science factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon! And the men of the moon who can not breathe in their own world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough, it is too difficult and the dangerous scenes (usually the best in series) are few and far away. Visually, am I the only one who thinks that the bullet-shaped helmet of Commando Cody (or is shaped like a lemon) looks totally ridiculous? The Rocketeer was much cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, it was horrible). The vehicle similar to a tank is not much better, it seems that a group of children did it for Halloween. The only positive thing that occurs to me is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular (well, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But it is so unattractive ... <br /> <br /> It's not even worth looking for nostalgia. See Captain Marvel in his place. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (By the way, see the Memorable Quotes section to get a real Lib pearl for the woman).
