Raw, sometimes foolish. For me, it is the summary of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work: page 3. He has no point of view: he is only a little superficial and funny in stereotypes. What is the movie about?? Is it about informing about a clan of people (the so-called types) who are so busy socializing and progressing in their life profiles that they do not have time for anything else? And you are inside or outside of it. Is that there is no press to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and it is only a supplement; Maybe an artist to see who is who and what is what. Do not mix the two. And then there is the power game, which would happen in all areas of life. So, what did they say at the end of it all, nothing? Just a few crude jokes united in a direction that, otherwise, would be less a movie.
