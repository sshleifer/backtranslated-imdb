I was not remarkable enough to be truly horrible, I was incredibly lame. The story was not all bad, but the execution was horrible. <br /> <br /> To begin with, he moved too fast for us to get emotionally involved with what was happening. It just went wrong. The dialogue was so absolutely dazzling, simply flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, cruel anyway, made Deadpool bored. How the hell do you make Deadpool bored? It was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords that he did not even know how to use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards simply float and fly, or an extraordinary force to jump hundreds of feet in the air? And what the hell was going on with all the stupid helicopter movements? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. A round cane is not a helicopter shovel, you can not fly rotating super fast. That Gambit could not do it anyway. Nor Deadpool, especially when used as a replacement for the actual fight choreography. <br /> <br /> And this movie is proof that cable work should only be used by fight coordinators who know what they are doing, and know better than to use it at all. single. Shooting. as a replacement for the real fight choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson), and one of the worst fight choreographies I've seen in the memory of recent movies. It was as if the doubles coordinator shrugged and left everything to the special effects guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had the chance, with all these mutants who did nothing. Even the mutants that were shown in their cells that have powers (it's good to see a Quicksilver nod), did everything when they came out. Only Emma, ​​really crazy about this movie, Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so beautiful? And the stupid one, "The bullet will take away his memory." Do not you think Xavier and the X-Men would have noticed the huge bullet holes in his adamantium skull when he was X-rayed? I felt sorry for Liev Schrieber's man, in fact he brought a good Sabretooth considering the script. It made one of Marvel's simplest super villains feel real. But he could not save the film from his own epic limp. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was the level of reckless "reckless". Decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.
