What is supposed to be a simple generic mysterious plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a story that induces a headache on a group of characters (the only important actor is Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) , all trying to find the Assassin among a small cast of residents in an elegant apartment building. These characters range from absolutely stupid to absolute mean. As a cheap and low budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and his protagonist (a guy, I do not care who he is, because he really sucked) talking about his various possibilities of solving the crime, while constantly cut by an absurd detective with his head on his butt. Honestly, I've never had a worse time to watch an old movie of this kind, and I've seen some real head hunters. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler did not, because there was no butler. But pay attention to the guy who is closest to a butler. There you go. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
