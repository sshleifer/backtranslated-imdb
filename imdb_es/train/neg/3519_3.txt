There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a group of terrorists who land in the desert are prepared to survive for at least two days. In addition, throughout this desert, Stallone and company continue to run across bridges and stairways that provide shortcuts or convenient routing devices. Also, the Treasury police do not seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, the bad guys who could not hit the side of a barn with very high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> At first I liked the villain by John Lithgow, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not. Do not worry about any of your own bad guys, or all of them are killed. Eventually, he could no longer believe in the character. <br /> <br /> It's not worth paying the rent, it's not even worth taking the time to see it.
