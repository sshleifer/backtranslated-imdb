The only part that redeems this movie was the price I paid. At least, all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time spent on this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity lost the boat. When the protagonist and the type of the FBI went to the location of the alleged murderers, Mr. FBI handed a revolver to the woman. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver magically transformed into automatic. Is there still one to reflect on if an agent of FBP would hand over a weapon to a civilian? I do not think so. Mrs. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's a shame that the R rating did not allow much of it to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut out what could have been the best parts of the movie.
