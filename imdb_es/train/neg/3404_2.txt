I'm not going to bag this film for all the large number of technicians t | c | k | u | p | Yes, it would take two days to describe how all this is not remotely possible. Others have already pointed out all the relevant stupidities. <br /> <br /> Considering all that, I could still have enjoyed it, if only they had not included all the sentimental garbage of Disney, nauseating, exasperating, disgusting, that is so out of place anywhere, but in no way place beyond space, where the smallest error can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else. It completely ruined the value that production could have left. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that NASA has let this garbage out so that so many people get so much wrong information about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself irritation. Look Apollo 13 again. At least that tried to be something real.
