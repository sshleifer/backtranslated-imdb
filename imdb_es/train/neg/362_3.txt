Not to be confused with Madonna's movie "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly, carefree and casual comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing" that reviews a variety of new and promising artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece. Loaded with misinterpretations, misinterpretations and clothing, etc., "... Thing" has obtained some frightful criticism and to date has only been nominated for a complementary award. Pass on this.
