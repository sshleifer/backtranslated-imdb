Spike Lee has been in decline since his first successes and this disaster does not help at all. I looked at my watch frequently in the hope that the movie would end or get to the point. Lee's first film with a totally white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What is the point? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame character of the Godfather only adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I have admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do the right thing". This movie is a waste of time.
