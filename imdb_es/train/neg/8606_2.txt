I love the killer Insect movies that are so fun to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I have known him and I would like to have listened to him, as this movie was terrible, as he said, after he said that he was still dying to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: people are dying mysteriously and horribly, and nobody has any idea what the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but authorities laugh at his theory of killer slugs. <br /> <br /> Only when the count of corpses begins to increase and a slug expert from England starts sniffing. It seems that Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most exaggerated one you've ever seen a movie! The slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and the scenes seem to move quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is not like the book at all, the book was ten times more terrifying, ten times bloody and had much more history! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! Since I am a big fan of Slugs, the book and the second book called Breeding ground! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book and then watch the movie. Maybe you like more of what I did.
