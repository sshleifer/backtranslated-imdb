My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say that I do not let her see the new episodes on TV because all the characters annoy me. Baby Bear And Telly? My God, how can ANNOUNCE and babbling useless someone think of their 'parodies'? Elmo Give him a break, he does not like all the children, once again, annoying and he does not teach NOTHING to my son. Mr. Noodle? What I reject I think the only time I turned on the "new" show for her, she and I were stupider than before. The show has definitely taken a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the great educational works of OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and heaviness since then. The death of Jim Henson in 1990. The program no longer has the educational, fun and interactive presentations it used to have. The new versions seem to me simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational charlatans. On the way to US producers / writers You have another cartoon show for parents to sit in front of non-creative children without exercises to get their hair out. By producers / writers: I suggest you take out the old muppets and start recording content similar to the first Sesame Street. God knows I do not want my son to talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
