I've seen some pretty bad movies, and this is right there. There's no plan to talk, it's like one of those bad episodes of coma in a soap opera. I just wanted to slap that girl because, say, she's really suspicious throughout the whole movie. The monsters running with some bling was fun. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" there. And I read that this was done by, and or I watched a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's not surprising that it did not make much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote the band and nothing else. The effects are very good, the appearance of the film, the monsters and even the acting are good too. But the story and its narration are simply not there.
