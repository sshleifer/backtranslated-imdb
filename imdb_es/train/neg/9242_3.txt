What a fantastic premise: a film about the Berlin airlift. I should have everything. Tragedy. Suspense. Friendship. Rivals Berliner Frauleins and tough American pilots. Love and tears What we have is a movie without any of the above. Heino Ferch tries to pass himself off as John Wayne or something like that, but he fails miserably. He acts in such a way that at any moment he must break. Try playing the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why would the character of Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with him? Why were they throwing rocks in a lake? Why do you bring him bricks of coal? The SFX are very, very well made. Although too much The hundreds or more planes over Berlin, look like a squadron of formation of attack fighters instead of an organized airlift? as it was in fact Interestingly, the White House office, the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays seem to be the same dark and dusty set. Observe the same curtains, hanging from the windows, as if it were a protective shield against the nuclear rain. Why are almost all the scenes in the INTERIOR dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY presents himself as an unsafe, insecure and insecure General, who trusts his noble idea of ​​the airlift. It was the opposite. So combine all those individual errors and the result is a film that is based on no passion, no suspense or historical accuracy. Sad, started so promising?
