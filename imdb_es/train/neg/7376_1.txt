Steven, what have you done, have you reached a new minimum? It's strange since Steven's last film, Shadow Man, was directed by the same director who made this garbage. Shadow man was good, this was diabolically bad, so bad it was not even funny. Steven is barely in the movie and feels like he's in a cameo and, when he's in the movie, he's called half the time. As for the action, let's say that the Wizard of Oz had more action than this crap, there is almost no action in the movie and, when it finally arrives, it's boring, depressing, badly called action scenes. Seagal almost does not kill anyone, unlike him, in the films in which he goes with an army of men, that is, under siege 1 and 2 and the exit wounds. The plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that sometimes it does not make scenes. fury flight, better be good, it's a shame that I lost 5 pounds in this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
