Your mind will not be satisfied with this economic thriller of the end of the world; but prays who is the will A young couple passes the true end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some extraterrestrials disguised as people of the Church. <br /> <br /> Small thematic theme tour, FIN DEL MUNDO has the wit and the lack of brio and style. Of the purely similar films of the 50s. And it is not only that, but EOTW behaves like a hybrid, not only the day of the final judgment, but also the convulsive one. The villain of the movie is a well-known actor of character. <br /> <br /> This totally brazen slapdash looks like a piece of convent exploitation, that genre significantly from the 70s that today looks so gracefully outdated. Anyway, the secret laboratory of the convent is an unpleasant piece of futuristic decoration. Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; But the end of the world is not your pride at all!
