DeNiro is a teacher ... one of my favorites. And I love GOOD sports movies {not in baseball so much, but hey, it's their sports movies, right? I expected MUCH more for this movie. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes (whom I really do not like) is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role, for me, was fine. She is a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then creeps a little in some places. It seemed that I was so jerky! Considering the cast and the plot, it could have been much better. I rated it with a '4', and I was being generous. I'm a difficult guy with numbers!
