You have to admire the director Todd Sheets for his dedication, enthusiasm and enthusiasm when it comes to making movies: between 1985 and 2000, he made 34 movies. Unfortunately, if your Zombie Bloodbath trilogy has nothing to do with it, it's likely that everyone is a shit (and a quick glance at your IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students find detention a bit more eventful than normal after being attacked by hordes of undead, who have escaped from a military base of Top secret located directly below your school. Sheets, from a terrible screenplay by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the f-bomb), director Sheets offers another embarrassingly amateurish effort that offers some terribly awful performances from its untalented cast, its Terrible visual effects (some CGI junk and what appears to be the front of a gigantic cardboard space shuttle) and its poor-quality gore brand (a handful of spoils taken from under the clothes of its victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems an eternity watching irritant. Zombie Armageddon ends with a twist in time and the paradox that forces viewers to return to watch several tortuous minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets, what have we done to deserve having to see it again?
