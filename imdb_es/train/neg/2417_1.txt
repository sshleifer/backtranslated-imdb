This was, without a doubt, the worst thing in what I have spent money. I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this 'movie' and I paid money to see it. This does not even qualify garbage. No no. This is the juice that accumulates in the bottom of the industrial dumps located in particularly disgusting neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. Calling it garbage would degrade garbage everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register in IMDb and warn my peers. This character from luvahire claims that this movie is great. One has to question their understanding of reality. Let's take some of your comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director imagined his audience shrinking and grimacing at each phrase uttered by Ricky or alternatively bursting into uncontrollable laughter at times when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an outstanding job. <br /> <br /> "I am also an aspiring actor who took theater in my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotional in a scene, so I give accessories to the actors that They have to make an emotional scene and they can do it. " <br /> <br /> Wow. I must also give support to actors who can achieve emotional scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look at another line of work there, buddy, if you think these chuckleheads made it. Still, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. say ah say ah say ah <br /> <br /> "LEAD TO THE SEQUENCE" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would fail you just for this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too upset to continue. Now I will pass the film to my partner, Mr. Bangla. <br /> <br /> Good! If you have continued reading this far, I am assuming that you have already seen the movie, and now you are looking for one of two things in this commentary: 1) Additional vitriolic devaluation of what you agree was an exceptionally poor film. 2) Additional vitriolic degradation of what you feel was a good cinematic effort that needs to defend itself against scoffing as defamatory as I am. Whether you need help to articulate your displeasure or ammunition for a touching repair, if I say something good, you will only be disappointed, so let me assure you that there is little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here in IMDb have already listed the particular flaws of the movie (for example, acting, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), however , all these failures can be easily forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require these items to be top notch. The latest "Hood" failure, however, is his inability to fulfill the abundant promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" practically jumps off the shelf in the video store with its catchy line implications and frighteningly creative murders. Here was an opportunity to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to make gangster zombies kill innocent life while making docile, undead pimps who went everywhere . too deadly lice in their trick-or-treating rides. The mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious. Instead, the film is more like watching middle school children timidly deliver the lines to a work they are doing, but they do not understand. To avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of your video rental audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers recount the film with the following title: "Hood of the Living Dead: a homemade horror video that we filmed on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored. " Or maybe they could release it as a documentary. "The Day Creativity Died: an exploration of how a low-budget film can still be perfectly devoid of intelligent or original thoughts despite the lack of links to a major film studio." <br /> <br /> The potential tenant whose interest has not been stifled, should find the following propaganda on the back of the video cassette: "The Quiroz Brothers have shown once again that seeing things that one can easily do not It's very interesting.
