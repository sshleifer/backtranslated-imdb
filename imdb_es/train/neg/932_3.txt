I saw this movie, and I expected something to improve all the time. What's so great about a boy without emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show emotion for someone other than his son. Yes, I know that this is the reason why your son is the only one that makes you lose patience (if you can call it that), I understand. <br /> <br /> The characters are not developed, the relationships are not. Given enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she is talking about how her death shook her because they were so close. The logical synapses abound in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone saw Boogie Nights and wrote this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses patience" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, even the facial expression (or lack of it). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion. I was there, did you say that, Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film not only lacked emotion, but substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot. And it certainly does not have my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
