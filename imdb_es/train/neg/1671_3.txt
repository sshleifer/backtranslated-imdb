I saw it in the market square at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It is a really economic product, there is nothing wrong with that, but you have to compensate with a little sex, gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor, well done by the producers who hook her up, I guess. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the next spacecraft is very funny: you could imagine all the hands of the crew shaking it! <br /> <br /> Ha ha, but I wish the people who did this well, at least it is not pretentious.
