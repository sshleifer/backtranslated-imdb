This was a silly movie with a predictable story and a terrible performance! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The movie looked like a very long ad for the bright red lipstick Jessica Simpson wore, especially since there were many close-ups on her face. The premise was not fun and, as I said, so predictable. Any money spent on making this movie was a shameful waste. Any allusion to other old Marilyn Monroe films did not improve at all the visualization of Blonde Ambition. It was also so incredible: Jessica Simpson was able to fill a position as executive secretary in the blink of an eye. That was ridiculous!
