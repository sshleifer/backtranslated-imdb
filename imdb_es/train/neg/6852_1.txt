This movie is really amazing. I have seen many cheap trash movies, especially many 'full moon' images, but 'Dollman' is very difficult. So much together: the story laughable, the actors always on the verge of parody and special effects! How long could I talk about them! It's a really bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh at, you have to see it. And do not miss' Dollman vs. Demonic Toys'. It's really more fun and worse.
