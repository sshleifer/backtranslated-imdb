Also known in a different form as "House of Exorcism", this messy little movie <br /> <br /> takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value <br /> <br /> at all. <br /> <br /> The spare parcel involves the European tourist Elke Sommer, who has an opportunity <br /> <br /> to meet Telly Savalas, who looks like the devil that <br /> <br /> saw in a fresco in the square. Sommer is taken to a mysterious house in the country, where Savalas is the butler. There, he is mistaken for a woman who has been dead for a long time, and the real telenovela begins <br /> <br />. The blind husband of the blind matriarch of the house had an affair with the dead woman, who was the fiancee of the matriarch's son <br /> <br />. The couple that gave the ride to Sommer? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman is giving the driver, uh, "back seat driving <br /> <br /> lessons", and the husband knows and does not care. Eventually, <br /> <br /> most of the cast is killed, Sommer is drugged and raped, <br /> <br /> escapes, and the viewer is taken to a climax on board in a vacuum <br /> <br /> airplane ... which must have resembled the empty cinemas in which it was played <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this, "House of Exorcism", has scenes <br /> <br /> added the participation of a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear. There are "extras" after the final credits; Sex removed <br /> <br /> and bloody scenes. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bava is fast and furious, but his script is horrible <br /> <br />. There are half-baked ideas, abandoned plots and <br /> <br /> amazing conveniences that do nothing but push this thing <br /> <br /> in a kind of forward direction. You have life as mannequins for practice funerals <br /> <br />, the blind matriarch does not act as blind, <br /> <br /> and Savalas receives the same palettes he had in "Kojak" (Who < </ span> <br /> chases you, baby?). <br /> <br /> It seems that the project had two known stars, then wrote the script <br /> <br /> quickly, something that happens in Hollywood in a daily occurrence <br /> <br /> now. Savalas seems completely lost, delivering his lines in a choppy way, and wishing his character did not die in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen." Sommer runs and screams and gasps a lot, but <br /> <br /> his character is blank, I use the term "character" lightly. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie, and your reaction could depend on <br /> <br /> how much you're in Eurohorror, and Kojak. For my part, I can not <br /> <br /> recommend "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is not classified, and includes all the extras at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> Copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore <br /> <br /> , strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult situations <br /> <br />
