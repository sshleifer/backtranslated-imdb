The plot was quite interesting, with a history of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed watching Budapest as the movie was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two main characters was zero, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The scenes of love were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was very rigid, almost frozen. Rob Stewart was quite charming and youthful, so he looked like his older sister instead of his girlfriend. The end, when we finally discovered who was behind them, was quite weak and did not make any sense. I think I would have liked this movie a lot more if the relationship between the 2 actors was a little more believable.
