As soon as I started seeing posters and hearing about this movie, I got excited immediately. The Matrix was an incredible sight and could not wait to see the second, especially after starting to see the advances in other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie goers with me. While the action scenes in the film were incredible as always, they were simply too few. Apparently, in the first film there were constant fights, but the second adopted a more predicate (and much more unfortunate) point of view. To summarize the plot, there was not much that was not expected. The machines were digging towards Zion with the intention of destroying it (that's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in commercials). The dialogue of the film was absolutely horrendous. Unless you're a psychology specialist, you probably do not understand most of what is said in the movie, and that's why you just do not care. It became a kind of romantic movie with the presentation of events that happen in the lives and relationships of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as bad as he was in the first movie, seemed to have all the religion and preaching. Personally, I do not need to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of time, and I think I can not see the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constantly boring and dry monologues of basically all the characters made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the small amount of good fight scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the film pushed me right away. What movie ends with "To conclude"? How original those people are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to get to that. In conclusion, the movie was bad and that is the end.
