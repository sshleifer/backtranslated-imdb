and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the writer had never seen a horror movie and had not realized that everything he wrote was clichéd and trite, and has been parodied to perfection in films like "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Among the bits of fear is the most BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "let's go to the graduation party" trash. I wanted to tear my ears. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There was really no need to make this movie. The protagonist is not interesting and I kept thinking "She? Really? Is the boy obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act stupidly, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! In front and behind! There is not a single policeman asleep sitting in his car with the window down just waiting for his throat to be cut.) <br /> <br /> The killer in series just moves around Killing everyone you want without the slightest problem. There is no resistance from the victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the slightest idea of ​​counterattacking (or flipping the security lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like a sheep with a mental disability. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you are a gore fan, you will also be disappointed. All the killing is kept off the screen and, for example, it is done with good taste. (So, boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is the least interesting. Most of the time they happened when we found out. <br /> <br /> The only cliché that is missing is the cat that always appears in this type of movie. "Oh kitty, you scared me, I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then at the end, when it's time for the killer to die, well, let's say it's the easiest and most obvious option. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience was mocking and responding to the screen all the time. He was too stupid to believe and he was not scary enough. Do not encourage this type of lazy filming. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way, it's not the coronation of a prom king or queen, there's no tiara, there's no bucket of blood.) <Br /> <br /> So save money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
