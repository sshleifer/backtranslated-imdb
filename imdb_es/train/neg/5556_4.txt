Within the first 17 minutes of "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" by director Bradford May, we have already undergone a recapitulation and voice-over accompaniment in the first two films, an exaggeratedly funny performance, approximately three minutes of images simply recorded from the second film and slightly reprinted to make it look like a new footage, and an extensive advertisement that the titled and tormented title character looks at about Universal Theme Parks-Universal is the company that distributed this film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is quite complicated when it comes to cheap cashes in the success of a previous movie. <br /> <br /> On this occasion, the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake (also known as "Darkman", played by the actor "Mummy" Arnold Vosloo) locks horns with the evil crime lord and lousy husband Peter Rooker (played in a brilliant performance by Jeff Fahey), and in the course of the 87 minutes movie grows to develop an affection for the wife and daughter of Rooker, once again learning to care for someone else. <br /> <br /> Bla. Straw. Bla. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a silly way for the studio to earn a little more money from Sam Raimi's original film, which I consider a great action and suspense movie. <br /> Oh, yes, and there are also a number of silly sub-plots, including a villain who was supposedly one of the original doctors to save Darkman who was following his scars, and she seduces our hero to Think of it as an ally before revealing an evil plan to help Rooker create more superhuman thugs like Darkman. Apparently, she can not just do the same thing with the thugs she did in Darkman. Why? I really can not explain it, because the film certainly does not. <br /> <br /> There is also a secondary plot of murder involving a District Attourney that threatens to overthrow the Rooker organization, and some other very silly things. <br /> <br /> But it does not really accumulate. This film feels like two or three episodes of a television program edited together more than a real movie. The direction alternates between quite good and frankly careless (a scene in which Darkman travels in his vehicle similar to a train and dodges a rocket launcher is nonsense), and the editing is a mix. The movie moves too fast for anyone to care what is happening. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this film, and in fact, the whole series is just a little ... I do not know ... Another 15 minutes of footage in mixed bags. <br /> <br /> In fact, when commenting on the editing, one of my favorite things in this film is to see the reused images of the previous films and then look for images in this film that are repeated several times. Yes, it's so cheap. It's one thing to do a recap at the beginning of the movie, and maybe repeat one or two takes, but in the large volume they make (minutes of repeated images from previous movies), it's just careless and amateurish. <Br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that Darkman's psychedelic montage phenomena are a bit exaggerated in this movie. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in light doses and in the right context, as Raimi did in the original film. Here, there are at least four or five, and they feel very abrupt and out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, the film does not stop having some positive points. Some action scenes are well done. The clich√©d story of Darkman's longing for real life works well for a direct function to DVD. Part of the performance is nice, particularly Rooker's wife, played by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. In addition, although it is not Danny Elfman, the composer Randy Miller composes a good music that is based on the original themes of Elfman. <br /> <br /> But in general, the film is too fast, cheap and silly to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternately boring and exuberant from scene to scene, and Fahey, although it is a joy to see an exaggerated villain, simply does not fit into the series. <br /> <br /> I like "Darkman II", I would recommend this to fans of the original, who will surely laugh. Otherwise, it is not necessary to apply. A four out of ten.
