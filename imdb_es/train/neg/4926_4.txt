I saw this movie for two reasons: I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear a rather silly movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, since he explains his disdain for everything that is Christian, but there were so many conflicts that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before he is truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the other 5 people who saw this movie) that there is still . I really enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the film itself.
