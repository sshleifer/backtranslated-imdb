I thought "Intensive care" was pretty bad and very little fun. But at least not as bad as I thought it could be. Sometimes it's suspenseful, but it's never a good surprise. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> Fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment of all time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He finds himself moaning in the corner of the hall. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks: "Poor Peter, can I get you a band-aid?" <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed in Dutch and English. To save costs, all registrations are EE. UU., And the background of the news studio is a Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and you are watching the original version in Dutch.
