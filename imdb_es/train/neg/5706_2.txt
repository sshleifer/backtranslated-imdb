This movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following may seem like a spoiler, but it really only describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate and wise main character, his silly but well-intentioned partner with his ill-made attempts at comical comments, the initially hostile but soon the beautiful softened Lady who unleashes the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones taken hostage and, of course, the evil and careless adversary with his brutal henchmen. Everyone has already seen tons of these movies, and "National Treasure" is like any of them, with only a slightly modified envelope. Each turn of the story was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I am not the best tool in the shed). I'm pretty tired of feeling cheated by money after leaving the cinema of a Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt that way, pay attention to my warning; Stay miles from this movie.
