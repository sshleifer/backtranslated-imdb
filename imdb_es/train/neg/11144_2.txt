This movie reminded me of those "erotic shivers" that I used to stay up late and watched Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would label this movie with a softer core, since there is simply no simulated hit. There is, however, a lot of nudes: the opening scene is at a strip club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least a trick) and then an unexplained 10-minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and a nude. Female werewolf who seems to have assaulted the Munster by a disguise. The boys of 13 years rejoice. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The shots look like FMV from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the suit, it is shown many times. <br /> <br /> The plot and the performance do not make sense. There is a strange story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves. The Dark Wolf is the last, but from what I can say that hybrids do the same as all werewolves, they look human, they change a wolf and they kill people. The Dark Wolf is trying to find a mate, but strangely he can not find the mate but he can smell anyone who touches. Again, these skills are not useful since the Dark Wolf ends up killing several people whose target never touched, met or even saw the best I can say. The partner does not know he is a werewolf and is fighting against transformation or something like that. <br /> <br /> You would think it would be difficult to spoil a simple monster movie, but this is what they did. . You want low-end werewolf quality, go renting Dog soldiers want a ton of T & A this is your movie.
