Or maybe that's what it feels like. Anyway, "The Bat People" is as flat as a carpet, soft as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as the three combined. <br /> <br /> Okay, we hatch in a nutshell (setting bowl, that ...): a doctor (Moss) is bitten by a bat while he reviews a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and subsequently it becomes a bat (well, it's not exactly a bat but a bat) as a creature that looks more like a werewolf that kills its victims from the point of view of the camera in the first person ... <br / > <br /> But then there's the matter of the sheriff (Pataki), which is about the WORST Sheriff class: Hick's guy. He annoys people, mocks married women, steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (FIEND!), Smokes with one of those cigarettes in his mouth and speaks at the same time, making it look and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" and (this is the worst part) ... IT IS THE MOST ASSOCIATED CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> The whole movie, however, is just a television movie of the world. Weeks like crapola (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, to scream out loud! What did you expect, things of Oscar's caliber? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that not even MST3K can save? <br /> <br /> How about ... there are no stars for "The Bat People", full version OR MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there is ever a sequel to this movie, I bury my television.
