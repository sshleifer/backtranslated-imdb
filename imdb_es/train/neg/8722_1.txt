Not to be confused with "Alligator" (1980) by Lewis Teague, which is actually an excellent film, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy that Sergio Martino made in the late seventies (including the quite visible "L 'Isola degli uomini pesce" and the not so good "La Montagna del dio cannibale"). Scanning scandalously the plot of "Jaws", the script fails to create any suspense. The creature is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable. The silly tune of Stelvio Cipriani poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the start as the obvious elements of the reptile's food. There is no emotion in this, instead of laughter! And we could find this sad movie quite funny if the dialogues and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Very soon, the laughter stops in favor of a sour feeling as a consequence of such a condescending attitude. We could excuse poorly made films and poor currency effects, but not that kind of mentality. Never!
