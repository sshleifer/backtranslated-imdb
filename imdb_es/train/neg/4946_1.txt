It is true that I saw this piece with very few expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a talentless composer whose lack of talent is second only to the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon movie I saw that was 100% humor free. It's rude, offensive, redneck and blatantly anti-woman. As such, it is a creation consistent with Bohlen, but the average viewer will be rather discouraged by it. No wonder you've never seen yourself in a movie theater: I would have bombed BIG time! <br /> <br /> Even the expense of 6.5 MegaEuros could not save this piece of garbage. Save your time ... and money!
