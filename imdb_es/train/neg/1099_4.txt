I was surprised by Tigerland's ridiculously incredible plot. It was a liberal fantasy of what the military should be like. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things that the character of Colin Farrell could let escape with his superior officers. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason why the training camp is difficult, it's supposed to condition the soldiers for the battle and make them a cohesive unit. arrogant attitudes and men who do not obey orders ". He was encouraging Bozz to kick his ass because it was such a big danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not like to fight with someone like him in the war because I was more concerned about the feelings of the people than doing what was necessary to protect their unit. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
