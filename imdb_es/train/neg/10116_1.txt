Honestly, I want you to give me back the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who is fit to see this movie is Helen Keller. I told myself that this has to improve, this has to improve. <Br /> <br /> Then the zombies appeared and they had some raccoon paint in their eyes. <br /> <br /> They talked like normal people. <br /> <br /> One was driving a car. <br /> <br /> A voodoo woman asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (THERE WAS) the movie came out I could not stand it more Can I sue for half an hour of my life?
