Well, what can I say? <br /> <br /> "What the Bleep of We Know" has achieved the almost impossible, leaving behind masterpieces of the genre such as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin", and fourth, will go to the story as the worst movie I've seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, since I've seen many bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, which alternate between a silly and artificial story about an extremely annoying story. Photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a lot of heads talking about how quantum physics supposedly justifies her new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if you start your rest day meditating with people like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a good portion of grass, this movie is for you too. Otherwise, stay away. Trust my word. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about "What the Bleep do you know" is that it seems to be edited and organized by the same kind of people who shoot cheap weddings in House, complete with heart effects Pink, computer-generated flashes on the screen and other varied nonsense. Whoever let these people anywhere near a theatrical premiere is a mystery to me. I guess this is what Kenny G does to you too much. The film was impregnated with cheesy GCI, the "likes" that you or I can produce on our computer through the over-the-counter video editing software, but never would, because it's too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> the script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. Not only all the characters and conversations were cumbersome and invented, but the "writers" felt that they had to push all the relevant information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this film is about. your throat Well, given the target audience, it may not have been such a bad idea. The main character, for example, spends half of the movie popping pills. However, apparently, it was felt that it was not convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogues, which relate specifically to your anti-anxiety pills, in case the viewers can not connect your exaggerated pain and your suffering. Small white pills that you take when you feel sad. The acting ... Well, I've seen better acting in Ed Wood's films, and no, this is not an exaggeration. Heck, the little work he was in when he was 12 years old presented a much more inspiring performance than this one. It really happened. <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there with a group or random talking heads, a strange mix of crazy scientists, wacky doctors and self-proclaimed mystics, and they continue talking about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" "how a man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. Reality, as you see, is a field of probability from a lot of different possibilities, and it is only established in stone once the Observer chose to notice it. What happens when more than one Observer observes that they did not say, but again who cares? Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and you will be God, and nobody cares about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. Every reason is discarded immediately, since people are stuck in their paths and unable to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go for the rabbit hole." In addition, the Heidelberg Uncertainty Principle is supposedly a positive proof of alternative realities, parallel universes and so on. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the film. All these people are still talking about going through the holes of rabbits. I'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing I'm sure of is that it somehow involves anal sex. Actually, the movie is _exremely_ anti-sex. In any case, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, the talking heads speak, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over his body with a magic marker. , and he continues walking with an even more stupid look in his glazed eyes with which he began. <br /> <br /> I want 2 hours of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of random quotes that I remembered: <br /> <br /> "What I consider unreal has become much more real to me, and that, which I used to consider real, often it is much less real than the unreal. " - Some people who talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take for a man to have an erection?" Only one thought is needed, "nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are in. And he still has an erection." - Some self-styled mystic, director of her own lighting school. <br /> <br /> [while looking at herself in the mirror] "I hate you, I hate you, you're fat, you're ugly, I have you!" - Main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
