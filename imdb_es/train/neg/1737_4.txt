The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after the untimely death of Lubitsch during the production, is a juggling of sophistication and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and drama of disguises. In a 19th-century castle in southeastern Europe, a Countess falls in love with her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt; She is helped by her ancestor, whose magically painted image comes alive. Betty Grable, with a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been so beautiful, and her songs are very nice. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is flooded with different ideas that fail to fit, or entertain. The results are good-looking, but not absorbing. * 1/2 of ****
