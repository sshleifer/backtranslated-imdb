A group of children created a theater to have a marathon of horror movies throughout the night. However, as the night progresses, there is someone among them who kills them one by one. Who is he and why? I saw him in a theater in 1991. I was waiting for him, but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. The story is meaningless halfway (which could be due to a large edition before the film was released), the murders are relatively bloody (how this got a rating of R surpasses me) and the unmasking of the murderer final was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really very bad, this movie had potential. With a better script, this could have turned into a great horror movie. As it is, although it is mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed (I heard Stone will not talk about this). I give it a 3 and that's just for the cast.
