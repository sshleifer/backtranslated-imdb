Trust me, this is a disappointing movie that you should avoid and comes from a great Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a GREAT movie. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl who has been paid to protect. The advances of this movie mention that she was kidnapped. So, I will not reveal anything when I say that the film degenerates into a disaster almost impossible to see after she is kidnapped. Regardless of what the director tries to achieve, all he does is make the audience literally nauseous. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts continue for the next half hour while Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is get you out of the story. I am sure that the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story meant a change in the character of Creasy and that a different film should follow. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was a complete and unsatisfactory crap. The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality of the first forty minutes of the movie.
