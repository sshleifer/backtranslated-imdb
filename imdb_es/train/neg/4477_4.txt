What an empty and lustrous version of the classic novel. I wish people would stop messing with the classics when they clearly have no idea of ​​the real intent or point of the original. This version is not different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes is much worse, since the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy has to be the worst casting decision EVER ... anyway we go back to this version. Its objective is to make history relevant to a contemporary environment and a musical style. He succeeds in both, but the art is clear. Look at the garbage for a rainy day maybe ... The direction was normal and the edition abysmal. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn as Hindley and, in fact, is one of the British talents wasted. The part of Heath was played with great charm and belief, and I think casting is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. It is clear that he was a rental manager and did not instill the project with the passion he deserved.
