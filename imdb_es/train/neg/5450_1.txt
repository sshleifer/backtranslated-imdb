Such a pretentious and lame hip attempt. Devilish writing and dialogue and truly shameful acting. Really the worst movie I've seen (in the movies). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. I saw him when he went out in a cinema in Brighton. People were leaving and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! In the end there were boos and scorn from the little crowd that was left, which was quite sad since the relatives of one of the main actors were present and were very embarrassed. However, the movie was so bad that I really could not feel so understanding with them. Everyone has to start from somewhere and his son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt at "Tarantinism made in the UK". It's been 5 years, but sometimes I still shudder at the memory of that sad night at the movies. This is a movie without redemption features! I gave him a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a 'shameometer' for everyone involved in this unfortunate disaster of a movie. I know that some of them have advanced towards better things, the positive is that none of them could have sunk lower than this.
