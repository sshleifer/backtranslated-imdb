There are occasions when you finish a movie, you want to get a refund for the time that has just passed. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes to endure ... and I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The rhythm that a man goes from a controlled and straight life to a life without thorns and irresponsibility never It could be so fast. <br /> <br /> From a celebration of graduation to the predictable end, the man of privilege and culture of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) is seduced by a woman, by violence and by altering the mind. Substances Of course, the woman's part is understandable by observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But it is impossible to understand the cost of drugs, violence and dedication to a person you just met. <br /> <br /> Frankly, besides being able to look at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do anything else ...
