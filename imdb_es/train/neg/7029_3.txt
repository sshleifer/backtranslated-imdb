Phantom of the Mall is a film that fits best in the category "easily forgotten". It's a pretty bad variant in the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. It's not a bad idea for itself, but the plot and production of this film are too weak to provide a decent tribute to that story. On the positive side, Gaston Leroux does not have to turn around in his grave yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks and too many boring sequences to make it memorable. In addition, the writers wanted to give too much draft to the story of what is necessary. And although there is much mystery in the character of Eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** This is a young couple who is brutally torn because the child dies in a fire. That fire was put in his house because he and his parents refused to sell his house to make room to build a large shopping center. The boy survived the fire and hid in the mall to get revenge. Meanwhile, he protects his girl who now works at the mall and tries to forget her loss. **** END SPOILERS *** This rather simple plot, but quite effective, is complicated by many useless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should be an entertaining horror movie, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what fans want. There are some innovative murders, but they are not satisfying enough for people who want to watch a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a little humor! All this production, including the cast, is too serious. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... As for example, it is played by Ken Foree! Fans of the terrifying will recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! That is like the milestone of horror that has yet to find an equal. Even though his role in this film is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. Fans of television movies will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor, she is a good actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this, but I can not stand it ... so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. And finally, a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and has a bit of talent ... pity she never made it to the top. Actually, this movie is his greatest achievement and that says enough about his career ...
