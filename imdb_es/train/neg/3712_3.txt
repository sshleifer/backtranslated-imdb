When I first heard about "Down To Earth", I was very excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially funny at Dogma. But this movie turned out to be a disappointment. The performance of Chris Rock was not as good as that of his past performances, and the film was very poorly directed as a whole. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a stand-up comedy routine. Obviously, this works well in the scenes where you're supposed to be standing, but in the rest of the movie, it's not like that. Even when he's talking to another character, he seems to think he's trying to make a room full of people laugh. He has some fun moments, but mostly they come during the standing scenes (no wonder they have decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're practically there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie was misdirected. The movie has basically a plot of a joke: an old white man acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this could have worked and it was quite fun. The problem was that we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white man. It's supposed to be fun because it's this white guy who tells the jokes of Chris Rock, but most of the time we only see Chris Rock, so it's not that funny. The few scenes in which they decide to show us the white man talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If they had shown him more, the movie would have been much more fun. <br /> <br /> In general, a few moments of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" is badly performed, and misdirected. This was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
