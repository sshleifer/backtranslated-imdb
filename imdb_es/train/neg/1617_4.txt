What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions are made to "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange and monotonous inclination that sounds the same whether in the middle of a battle or talking around a campfire. <br /> <br /> In a way I saw these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, it's not really something to go and entertain. It is quite long and boring. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that given the lack of development of the plot, I do not think it is very educational either. <br /> <br /> It is also difficult to perceive any story in the dialogue of the film: it would be a good idea to read a bit about the story so that you can understand the context of what is happening, since for some reason the director does not He considered it appropriate to inform the public why Che's band was moving as they did, as a result, it seems that there are groups loitering in the woods for no particular reason and being shot. <br /> <br /> I would have loved to give this movie more stars to somehow generate more empathy with me and develop depth of character, but somehow all the characters were still strangers to me in the end. The stars he receives are for realism and show the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
