The television guide described the plot of SEVERE TIMES in the following way: "An experiment on a severed arm goes wrong", so I immediately thought that it would be an arm that has a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or HAND or someone who receives an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS. Both premises were tried and tested, or to be more precise, they got tired and tested, so I was curious to know how the producers would approach the story. In fact, I thought they were making an artistic film like PI until the use of black and white photography at the beginning of the film, but the creators seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD I have very little to say about this, except that I did not like THE EVIL DEAD movies and I did not like TIMES, and it seems really unfair that movies like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world cries out for condoms.
