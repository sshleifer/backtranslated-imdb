I must confess to having seen some howlers in my time, but this is one of the worst of all. Plot worrying to follow. Sex and violence are disoriented and distract the bad movie. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the plaster will take a look at the final product and would like it to accumulate dust on a shelf so as not to be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
