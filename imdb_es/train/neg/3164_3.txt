The odious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her from the back of a truck and kills her. Then he tries to ruin his ex-boyfriend's relationship with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> An obvious non-original movie would not be bad in a clich√© form, except that Longoria's character is hateful and disgusting because it drains all the fun out of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair, Longoria, or anyone else in the cast or the team, is not the problem, it is the terrible script that sinks the process. It is really very stupid.
