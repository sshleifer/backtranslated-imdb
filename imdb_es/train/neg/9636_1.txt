['This staggering waste of production money is a film test that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a game (silly) by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor, Burton and Noel Coward, this project shot in a spectacular mansion on a mountainous island on a cliff in the Mediterranean must have seemed like a Fire sure Winner when it was presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. Visually, the film is spectacular, but that is the force of nature that has allowed the stage and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of Taylor&#39;s shriek, Burton&#39;s half-sleepy wanderings, the crazy dialogue, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot arguments and absurd disguise simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent and a clear proof that famous people praised can be idiots like the rest of the people of the planet. Not even fun. Simply terrible and maddening rubbish']
