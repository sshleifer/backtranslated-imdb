THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it does not have all the usual flaws that sink most of those movies. It has a definite history, it has an adequate performance, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad are formidable men, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new DVD release, so people will search here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where the 10 come from, since there's no way this movie is so good, even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a theater was Warner's destruction of the much-loved and excellent book by J. K. Rawlings, Order of the Phoenix. When comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as Warners did) did not have a story, certainly the director did not allow acting, photography was terrible, and the dominant music of the sound wall was simply a disaster. I qualified Phoenix with a "1" because the scale does not go down any more. THE DECOY is 4 times better, in all aspects. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3: the shooting" or any of that nonsense. It is original. If your expectations are not exaggerated by the silly "10" scores here, you could enjoy the movie on your own terms.
