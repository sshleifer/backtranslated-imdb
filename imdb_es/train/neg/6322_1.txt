This was one of the anti-nuke movies STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and a basketball star could "change the world" is pretty far fetched, given the amount "marches for the peace of children" and "celebrity protests" were and ARE. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik children heard about a "silent protest" in the West, is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What ended the Cold War? America is hard, I dare to say the "reaganica" posture and the internal failures of socialism. NOT the peace marches, the "nuances" or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck", "Miracle Mile" or "Testament".
