The images are great and reflect well the landscapes of Canada. The story was, on the other hand, quite boring; For my eyes, it was a love story in the woods just like Titanic was a love story on a ship. I did not feel that Gray Owl was a great ecologist. Usually, I like Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
