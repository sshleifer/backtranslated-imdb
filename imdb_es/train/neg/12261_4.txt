The standard rate of "paint by numbers", filled with a lot of routine plot devices from great creatures movies. It is as if someone had a deck of cards with ideas of the plot of other films written on them, which were shuffled and distributed. Whatever the plot and the characters that emerged in the deal, they launched into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so full of clich√©s that you can play a game of "Guess who ends up as a monstrous meal" after less than ten minutes of play in the movie, and you'll probably get them all right ... Including the order in which they will be devoured. Many of the characters are so unpleasant that you encourage the creature to silence them. Some of the main characters include: a clone of Billy Idol surfing with sharks, an open-mouthed brat showing bank wrecks, a Captain Cap de Ahab with a vendetta and Ahab's girlfriend doing poor quality dances in a bar . Oh, and a big, big beast that needs anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people argue a lot, beautiful girls run in wet T-shirts, couples kiss on exotic beaches, explosions happen, ruins of a sanctuary appear and greasy-faced pirates pass by. there. <br /> <br /> Funny, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the insensitivity of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent death, they make jokes of a single line. I could almost hear images of tires. <br /> <br /> In general, it's okay, if you have 90 minutes to lose and you want to laugh at a movie so bad, good, good. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
