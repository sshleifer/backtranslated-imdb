"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What is that supposed to mean?! This plot could not be worse when a child, who is afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the end of the film because he entered a library. The sole purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more effective way of doing so could have been a series of advertisements. Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as the so predictable "who is the Page Master librarian"), could save this meaningless film from the boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the God of Hollywood of voices, Frank Welker as cartoon characters never save it. I can only describe it as an equivalent to the 1990s of the still frightening 1978 adaptation of Water Babies, because the smooth animation makes the movie worse, it does not improve the boring plot!
