I think this piece of junk is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why do all American animators think that children these days want stupid versions of good GI JOE stories? The Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean, come on! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only want to create an idiotic and cheap show that children will love because hey !! ! Kids love superheroes, right? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see the new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of a superhero, this does not sound so bad, but the problem is that this program tries to copy series like Batman the animated series, or the new league of justice, the result? the bad copies of flash (the road racer) or Superman (who else ??? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes was not meant to be dramatic, they were supposed to be fun !!!! As I said before, this series sucks, and many people wonder why the anime is taking everyone. this program tries to be dramatic and full of action, but that is something that few series and anime can do, if you want to see a good update of an old program, Tiny Toons, is an example that is possible to revive. Ancient characters, but with a good history and respecting the original roots. Too bad the show is already dead, another corporate decision wise, I suppose.
