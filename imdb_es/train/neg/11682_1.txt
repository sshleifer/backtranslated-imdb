Now it's not like that. Considering all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film never became anything more than a movie impersonator / horrible robbery impersonator. Yes, a couple of jokes, absolutely no unpredictable turns, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are there because the director and the editor made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If someone can tell me why the hell they were digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell is Rebbe and how on earth they knew diamonds were in a particular cell, it could be my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to Let's take too many things in this matter, and do not raise your eyebrows when something seems stupid ... it's just another study contract movie, relax and enjoy ...
