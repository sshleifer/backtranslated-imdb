This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. The acting is poor and the plot is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like light ships or any other ship, it is irrelevant. As for special effects, the movie has none. It is likely that the entire film crew was on the boat in rough seas instead of in a studio and when some of the men are "stabbed" (if you can call it that), their reactions are totally unreal. The weapons are quieter than a mute. How this film could have only two prizes raises serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well that's it. This review is probably more fun to read than the movie. If someone is considering seeing or buying it, I would seriously advise you not to do so for obvious reasons. I said it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a gun is fired is a plot. I guess it's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
