Nick Millard, aka Nick Phillips, should have done quite well when he did "Criminally Crazy" 10 years before the release of this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" lasted less than an hour should have given him the idea that he had probably milked this story for everything he was going to get ... but instead, he chooses to use TONS. Also from this material from the original, even to the point of recycling the initial initial credit sequence! Unfortunately, bringing back the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save her. The little of the original video that was seen in this movie seems as if it had been filmed with a rented handheld camcorder! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and I would be surprised if I did something similar to that amount. Avoid this and look at the original!
