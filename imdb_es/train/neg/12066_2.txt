Okay, how about this for the original? That is, the old and rich old man leaves his inheritance to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two spooky servants, as long as they spend the week in their old spooky house. What happens that night will only surprise those who have not seen a movie or a television program before. After a series of murders in which victims seem to be bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious end of turn. The cast is run by some actors who once respectable must have been desperate for their paychecks. There are also some second level actors who were getting up at that moment but who have now forgotten. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "Matlock." I'll give credit where it's due: the final scene is smart and fun, if you're still awake.
