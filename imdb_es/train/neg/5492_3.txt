The people of Disney have a lot to explain. First of all, why did someone think that this material from a small comedy would be a decent half moving movie? In the teleplay of the 60 years, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us had not yet received the sophisticated treatment of the X Files. Picturesque visions of little green men for a long time have been dispelled by people like ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> All the charm that the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the non-mundane visitor. The conceit that Martians have an antenna seemed silly back then. Now he seems positively idiotic. However, Christopher Lloyd's uncle Martin wears metal appendages. At first, the antenna on a sign on the TV station where Tim works should make us think "Martian"! When was the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, huh? <br /> <br /> Disney does not trust the picturesque or the relationships, and fills this movie with special effects for young people that include a space suit to talk about called Zoot! Yes, you read correctly: Uncle Martin's silver space suit speaks. He is supposed to be a real hilarious cut! Figure again. I have elastic socks that are more fun than Zoot. Every time the action is delayed (and constantly delayed), the computer graphics are put into play to animate things. Tim is played here by the kind Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will not) do anything to save this mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to the role of the next lady. Even Ray Walston himself is dragged with pain into the proceedings, all in vain. This extraterrestrial visitor is dead on arrival. <br /> <br /> The constant conversation of situation comedies that happen to the screen only makes me hope that the movie I DREAM OF JEANNIE does not show a talking harem attire. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie BEWITCHED has no lines. I live with the fear that I LOVE LUCY: THE MOVIE will proudly present a CG Conga Drum called Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your leader.
