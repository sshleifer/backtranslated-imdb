If you have seen fewer movies, this could be a great one for you. If you've seen many movies, this is a joke. The performance of real heroes is very poorly represented. Not to mention that there are songs, there are many flashbacks, and most importantly, the fight scenes are stupidly interpreted. The new characters, a good address, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the heroines / heroines of Bollywood, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they show are terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. It is supposed to be a realistic movie, but it is not shown. There are times when you ask yourself, you have thousands of vehement soldiers full of soldiers who move and the Pakistanis are bombing them and none of their bombs hits them. Are the Pakis really bad at aiming or did the director make them look stupid? Only a few characters that were very good, but in what concerns the plot, the action, is misdirected. This movie could have been short if they took songs, flashbacks, remained in the point.
