I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good and others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but other teens at the prom as main friends were not as convincing. The killer was so stupid and he also looked so stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The movie was also very boring and very overrated. It was not suspense at all, I almost fell asleep. It's another bad remake of PG-13, it's really a terrible IMO movie. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very hurried and boring. The movie is quite slow too. In general, the only good thing about this crap fest is that maybe BRITTANY SNOW I think he also had a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but besides that it was a completely terrible movie and a horrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave him a 2/10.
