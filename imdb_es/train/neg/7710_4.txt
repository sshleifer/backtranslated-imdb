"The attack of the murderous tomatoes" consists mainly of a wandering and poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. The plot does not make sense, and the various characters enter and leave the image without any explanation. Seeing this false nonsense, you have the feeling that so many other comments have captured so accurately: that it is easy to make a cheap and low quality film and then use the angle of "parody" as an excuse for its low price and low quality ( In a scene, the swimmers are terrified by the tomatoes that float near them, how far can the "suspension of disbelief" go, even in a parody? However, the title song is great. (* 1 / two)
