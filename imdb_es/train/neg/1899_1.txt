I saw this because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and great cars to watch. I guess they lied to me. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting outside a Porsche dealership to see if they have the right car. When they confirm that it is the correct one, Kip removes a brick from the trunk and throws it to the window, breaking it. He gets the Porsche while his friend receives the keys. They start the car and go out at night. They deliver it to a warehouse only to be followed by the police. Then, the entire crew gets rid of all the cars and goes their separate ways. Then, we can take a look at Memphis Raines. He is giving a small speech to a group of children at a kart track. Then, he faces Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in a deep * bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This man threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars in 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 The movie's schedule takes place when Cage and Duvall search for a team and plan everything. The last 12 hours in the movie are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You can see 10 cars out of the 50 that are advertised in the movie. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The persecution: the persecution at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not suspense at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the hamburgers and also swallows three keys. This is impossible. The keys were open. The keys would have severely damaged the esophagus, stomach and large intestine of the dog. The boys suggest giving the laxative dogs to help him poop. This will not work. The dog will have a lot of diarrhea but not keys. It was declared in Jackass after Ryan Dunne put a toy car in his rectum. Take laxatives, a lot of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The policeman during the chase: when Eleanor collapses for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the car. You see a police patrol car behind him that is not looking at his car at all. But, just as Nicholas Cage re-starts the engine, the police officer tilts his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts chasing it. It is stupid. Then, just as he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How do you know what the right car is? Just see the back. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid I've never seen the original, but I intend to do it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie one out of 10 stars. It gets The Fast and Furious.
