This science fiction adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the claim that bad science fiction is funny. The strange pink dyeing and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late, late, late viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight giant monsters like giant amoebas and other strange creatures. Pretty cool <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you fall asleep for a moment. I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics not to be missed.
