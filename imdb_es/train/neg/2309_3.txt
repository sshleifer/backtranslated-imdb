I have a great tolerance for the weird, but frankly, some movies go far beyond the weird, to the point that they make your brain ache. This is such a movie. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is better understood while consuming drugs: it is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a very cute Japanese animation that involves a cat. However, unexpectedly there are tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things, which makes me wonder if I am missing something in the translation. However, even if this is so, why do we need to be treated with images of a magic trick that involves dismembering a lady with a habit, defecating, vomiting, igniting burning animals, etc. All this really seemed random and quite horrible? Interestingly, and I do not know why, some see this as a work of genius. I just do not understand that.
