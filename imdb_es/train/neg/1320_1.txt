This movie was exactly what I expected it to be the first time I read the casting. He probably could have written a more exciting argument, it's a shame they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba surely was a good skier, but he has to thank God (and us too) that he does not have to rely on his acting skills to make a living. She can not play, she can not talk, she can not even move very well on dry land without her skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a very blonde girl, and that's it. She was obviously not chosen for her amazing competition in dramatic roles, but most likely for her beautiful legs. However, I must admit that she could be Tomba's theater teacher, because she is even an actor worse than her, and that's funny, especially considering she's not Italian. I laughed all the time, watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it really made me laugh, loud, very strong.
