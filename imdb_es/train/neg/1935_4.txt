Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy movies. The film offers the special casting effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. All the actors play extremely silly cartoons. You have to be still in diapers to find your slapstick humor even remotely fun. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to look like the old Godzilla movies, which include special effects larger than life and a (good, another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have smiled if I was waiting for the camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what garbage fantasy fans have to put up with, in this case because somebody thought they could get some extra money out of a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the dairy cow is now dead as a dodo.
