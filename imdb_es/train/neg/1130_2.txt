Excessive drama that is not able to make any real point. Then she became an actress, so what? She learned to love - great thing. There is a certain eccentricity between the characters and in dialogue and situations, but the kind that is bad for the film, so it often seems absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, protagonist, speaks and behaves like a semi-delayed person, so there is no choice but to see the film as about a delayed girl who comes to the world of theater, who clearly does not It was the goal. At first we were told (in that narration similar to "Barry Lyndon") that she learned to hide her emotions, which undoubtedly explains her autistic face, but the film suffers for that. Basically, she walks like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely credible due to her lack of emotion. From time to time, the movie had that dull and sleepy feeling of a 95 Dogma movie. Is it one? I would not be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, with more than 350 photos / entries, contact me by email.
