A cheap exploitation film about a mother's search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make porn porno movies. The road takes the mother across Europe as she searches for her son and we, in the audience, struggle to keep ourselves asleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of the countless sleazy software movies that are made for people who want the thrill of pornography without the stigma or danger of showing up on their credit card account. Personally I prefer to have the stigma because those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we are seeing. This is supposed to be a sexy thriller but it's not. Mainly, these are people who talk about things followed by many walks from one place to another and lead to leadership. Periodically, throughout the film, several people undress and everything has more than a touch of S & M in the proceedings. Violence and fetish material are the kind of provoke a laugh instead of horror or even emotion, everything is incredibly false. Worse yet, there is not enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically, on par with the course for many of these movies) <br /> <br /> You'll forgive my lack of details, but it's just a boring and boring movie with which I stayed until the end with the hope that it would happen something remotely incomprehensible. , But there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the blond-haired villain with the huge bite and the nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she looked like when she was a child and wondering if she had undergone plastic surgery, not the kind of things you should think about in an exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
