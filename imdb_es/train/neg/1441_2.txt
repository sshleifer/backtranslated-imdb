I chose this movie on the cover only thinking that I was on an adventure at the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I was expecting a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn I've had before, though. This yawn was so big that I could hardly find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described incredible special effects. There was none. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were terribly portrayed. Gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach that to your children. I do not. Stay away from this. If you are looking for family entertainment, then you can find something that is more inspiring in other places.
