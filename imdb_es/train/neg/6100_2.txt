Effort aside (this is not a review about good intentions, but about the final product), this film is badly written, exaggerated and misdirected. The story obviously had potential, but that story is not present anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness and self doubt just like the rest of us. You would never know that about this movie from the performance of the main actress. In fact, apply that to all the characters in the movie, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic about the superior discourse as if it were an inhuman robot. In fact, it's the only scene that plays well in one of the board meetings, and I realized that because she's giving a speech! Every idea you have is amazing in its context and you come up with ideas that sound as if they took a lifetime of searching for the soul in the act. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he begins to pontificate about the needs of the battlefield and to protect the soldiers and put white flags, etc. As shown in the movie, there is NO WAY where you can find such a detailed character. idea well thought of in seconds. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION, this movie robs Clara Barton of her problems. It robs his humanity, and cheapens everything he did because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton, and seems to have based her script on an article in the Britannica encyclopedia. (Yes, they had them back then) But hey, good technicolor! (who cares)
