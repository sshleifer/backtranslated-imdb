This movement was on television last night. I guess like a time pad, because he sucked badly! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere in the middle. (They are not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf", if that's how you can call it, barely shows up, saves your teeth. When it's completely in sight, you can clearly see that they had some inmates working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like it's running on a treadmill, and the CGI's coat looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <The movie is full of blood and blood, and you can easily see who is going to be killed / cut / eaten below. Even if you like this kind of splashed movies, you will be disappointed, they did not do a good job. <br /> <br /> I do not even mean actors ... Very cheesy lines and Girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But, again, if someone asked me to act wrong just to give me a few dollars, hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> In general, boring and with horrible laughter.
