Do not waste 90 minutes of your time in "Fast food, fast women". It's an annoying and episodic script with three story lines attached is ridiculously bad because of predictable writing, horrible acting and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character annoyed to see each time she was on the screen. SHE needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you would spend on this turkey doing something more exciting ... like cutting your toenails. You would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is Louise Lasser, but it deserves much better than this tired script. He is as powerless as the older boy he courts in the movie. <br /> <br /> BEWARE OF THE VIEWER!
