I saw this recently and I must say that I was touched by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not work at all. However, I am looking forward to seeing the documentary made by the producers who organized this project because I think it would be a much more convincing work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast was composed of B- class actors, but their performance was appropriate, and I must give a special mention to the young actress who played Holly. This was his first role in the film and he did a very good job, considering that his is the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was adequate, but insipid as Patrick, the American whose mission is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his final role. Unfortunately, despite my mostly favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, these two actors were very forgettable and did not do their best work in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and the intention of the film, but I have to be fair, so I rate "Holly" with 3 stars according to their shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this film have also made a documentary that I hope will have its debut on the BBC and other television channels.
