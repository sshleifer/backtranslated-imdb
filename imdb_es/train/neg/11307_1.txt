The perfectly stupid weapon. I think the guys who danced at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's films had the intention of making fun of Jeff doing his ways to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff acts as well as the sofa that hits with some type of weapon in a scene.
