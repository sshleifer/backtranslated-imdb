Here is the good news first. "Spirit" is the most incredible animated film in the current premiere of home theater. The illustrations and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend you take a look at this film just for the visual aspect. <br /> <br /> And now the bad news. I mean it when I say that animation is the only thing that this film has in its favor. You may remember that the "Spirit" was mistreated by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more consolidated and had better publicity, can write me a four-page essay entitled "Why did not Lilo and Stitch's script stink?" <br /> <br /> For all the amazing new animation technology that is shown in "Spirit", the story is almost * surprisingly * boring. Here is a lesson and (needless to say) it does not apply only to animated films. You can have the most amazing visual effects there is to decorate the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, what is more important, we do not care about your characters, it's a bad movie. Simple as that. The animation is still amazing; I just can not wait to see what someone with more imagination does.
