I had to do a search in the actresses to find the advice of this film because the title is now An unexpected love. It really is not worth looking for, but I was not familiar with both tracks and I wondered why they were leading a lesbian movie on Lifetime. Everything is quite restricted and you really do not have an idea of ​​who these characters are, so, as a spectator, I could not get emotionally involved in the story. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is silent and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a great interest in seeing two women who kissed, but it was handled so discreetly that I was disappointed. Rent Personal Best instead.
