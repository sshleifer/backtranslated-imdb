I hate to throw lines like this, but in this case I feel I have to: the new US version of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There I said it. And now that I've taken that out of my system, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in the hands of a powerful rage, a curse is born, the curse accumulates in that place of death, those who find it will be consumed by their fury." That's the premise of THE GRUDGE and I'll admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not take it any further. Those who encounter the "curse" are consumed by their fury and that is all you get. Do you want more? Very bad Some critics and fans are pointing out that the only purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is not a plot to talk, the images and the spooky sounds can only go very far. Director Takashi Shimizu, taking out a George Sluizer and remaking his original film (s), does he bravely try to build an environment in the first hour? repeating the same scene over and over and over and over again. It almost develops like this: <br /> <br /> -the person enters the house <br /> <br /> -something flashes through the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> The person is going to investigate <br /> <br /> The sound starts to sound <br /> <br /> The person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> -Nube screams and / or cat screams <br /> <br /> -cut to black <br /> <br /> Before the audience has an idea of ​​the plot, this same scenario takes place 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually something spooky. Each subsequent use became laughable as the movie progressed. When the film ended, my friend and I wondered if this scene would end "with a loud cry and a black cut". It was never proven that we were wrong. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a line story, instead of being displayed in a series of vignettes that leave the audience entangled. I have no problem with non-linear narration when it is done well. The film jumps from one period of time to another without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this narrative technique spoils any kind of mystery that the film may have had. If you already know that ghosts have scared two characters to death, how amazing is it when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the green light of the second US version of THE RING won $ 15 million on its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing more than a calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The most frightening thing about THE GRUDGE is that it earned $ 40 million dollars in its first weekend and some people consider it the "most terrifying movie ever made". I wonder what will happen to those who are consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE.
