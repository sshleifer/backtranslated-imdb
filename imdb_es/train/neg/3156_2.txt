I just want to clarify one thing: I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really disappoints him. His performance is still excellent, he is still as charming as always, and still looks great. But the movie itself is a load of garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say, is a little manly ... you're constantly waiting for her to go with her best friend, whose secondary story is a little weird. The soundtrack of the film also discouraged me and my family (who sat and watched the movie with me); sometimes the music just did not fit with what was going on in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I thought was a very disappointing movie. He could forgive the bully of the protagonist, he could forgive the extravagant characters that were thrown into the mix, and he could forgive the bad choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was to cut the entire central section of the film. and jump directly to the end ??? Obviously, the end was planned from the beginning, but how you get there is not counted. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster.
