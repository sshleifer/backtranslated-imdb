The worst thing about Crush is not that he has acted very badly, or that the plot is practically nonexistent, and it is not even so bad that the work of the camera could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has some absolutely brilliant moments that make you hope there's more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and the cheap scenes of tears of more than 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriages, then do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I'm not Exactly excited to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty awful time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
