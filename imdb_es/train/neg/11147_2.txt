I have nothing to comment on this movie. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" ... anything will do, even look at the walls is best. <br /> <br /> And since I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text, I also tell you that it's a low budget movie, bad acting, no name actors, a stupid street dog like the wolf, and so on successively ... In addition, the story does not bring anything new, the special effects are made in the style of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (not watching this movie)
