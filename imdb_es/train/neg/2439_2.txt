"Intensive Care", by Dorna von Rouveroy, is one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch action movie offers some bleeding and a lot of absurd situations. A veteran of terror, George Kennedy, is completely lost like Professor Bruckner. The acting is abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He sits in a coma for seven years and then wakes up and goes off in a bloody uproar. "Intensive care" is clearly influenced by American slasher movies. including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". The murders are fun and the dialogues are painfully stupid. Still, if you're in the right mood, you can take a look at this piece of junk. You will laugh until it hurts with this. one-can you believe me!
