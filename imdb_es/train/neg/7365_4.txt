A not bad movie, but not that great either. Kirk Douglas is a security agent recently released from prison who, after refusing a Mafia offer, decides to retire from work himself. Recruit the circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Chaos occurs. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves chased by the mobster Goon Romano Puppo, as well as entangled in a very silly love triangle with the infinitely patient girlfriend of Douglas (Florinda Bolkan). The director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there is at least one excellent and creative sequence of car chases with Puppo and Gemma. Although it is an Italian production, most of the filming seems to have been made in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just in a slum of Giallo. The amazing Bolkan gives an excellent performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
