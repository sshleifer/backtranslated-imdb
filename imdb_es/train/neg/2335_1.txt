A film so insecure that the creators maybe expected to milk an original classic title of the film noir, "Farewell My Lovely", thinking that the credulous would assume it as a remake. The characters are so disgusting and unattractive that they deserved their cold reception when they were first launched. Time only adds its absurdity. Having nothing of the cunning, the cinematography, the despair or the despair of the classic noir, it was based on a twisted and meaningless criminal plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests in a matter of hours. As if that were not enough, he launched an erotic attempt without sex in which at least one of the participants had not bothered to bathe in several days. This only made this mess more painful to watch. Find a good classic cinema from the forties or fifties instead of losing two hours in this failure.
