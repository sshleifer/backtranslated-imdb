VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) is attracted to a country house isolated inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and they become entangled in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but their hosts turn out to be vampires with a frantic lust for human blood ... <br /> <br / > Taking his example From the cycle of lesbian vampires initiated by the nonconformist director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of the series "Carmilla" by Hammer in the United Kingdom, VAMPYRES, the bold and daring scandal of Jose Ramon Larraz, It pushed the concept of adult Horror far beyond what the British censors were prepared. He tolerates it in 1974, and his film was cut for nearly three minutes in its original British release. It's not hard to see why! Using his Gothic theme as a pretext for so much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time allows, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a mere backdrop to background for a languid meditation. about life, death and impulses, sexual and otherwise, that affirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Shot in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, Harry Waxman's disturbing cinematography evokes an atmosphere of gloomy foreboding, in which the desolate countryside, gloomy and beautiful in equal measure, seems to presage a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz did a similar trick the same year with SYMPTOMS, a discreet thriller that bursts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel). However, despite its pretensions, the thin VAMPYRES plot and crude production values ​​will divide the audience from the beginning, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and attractive as could be desired, the male protagonist (Brown, past his apogee at the time of filming) is unfortunately a mistake in a role that should have gone to a beautiful stud in his twenties. An article that must be seen for fans of cult movies, a funny curiosity for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Beware of the silent era superstar, Bessie Love, in a short article at the end of the movie.
