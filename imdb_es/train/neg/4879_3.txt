Is there anything worse than a comedy movie that lacks humor? The answer is yes; One that does not generate any interest throughout the image. The premise is not so bad, a naive front for an illegal business, but this is a potboiler with a deficient script and script and it just does not work. <br /> <br /> Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the image is the cast, which contains several familiar faces from the 30s and 40s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weak man who killed Gary Cooper in "Lives of Bengal Lancer ", so I did not tell it). <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this and I gave it a rating of 3: if you have an option, get a root canal treatment. .
