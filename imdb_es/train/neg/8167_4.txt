The Forest is not just your standard cannibal slasher / backwoods daily rate, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples who walk through the woods on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, wild cannibal men and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrify them. There is something that you do not see every slasher. The director Don Jones gets an "A" for his effort, although the film itself collapses on almost every level, the performance is simply average, except for Jeanette Kelly, who plays the dead wife of the woodcutter (Michael Brody, also known as Gary Kent). <Br /> <br /> The movie starts with some beautiful photos of a couple walking through a valley and entering a forest. They realize too late that someone is harassing them. Both are shipped in the typical slasher rate. Our killer uses a trustworthy hunting knife throughout the film, except during a flashback when he implements a hand saw, a fork and a rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover. <br /> <br /> The Forest has a good story, but the movie just does not work together with it, I found it quite boring with the simple acting of shit. 4/10
