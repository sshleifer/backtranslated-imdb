If you've ever seen an eighties slasher, there's not much reason to see this one. Originality is often not one of the strengths of slasher cinema, and it is something that this film seriously lacks. There really is not much that can be said about Pranks, so I'll do it fast. The movie was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a group of children who stay in a bedroom at Christmas. While they are in a slasher, someone decides to start eliminating them and this leads to one of the most boring mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on Nasty Video's list is strange because, despite some bloody scenes, this movie is not going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and more slashers than this one (Friday the 13th, for example) It ended forbidden But, again, there are forbidden movies that are much less bloody than this one (The witch that came from the sea, for example). Anyway, the conclusion of the film is the best, because although the audience really does not care less who is the aggressor at this point; It's pretty well done. In general, this is a sad and gloomy slasher that even slasher fans will do well to lose.
