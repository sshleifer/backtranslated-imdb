I'm not from America and I know what the 'Wife Exchange' is. When a show with that name came out, I was thrilled to see some great sexual moments of the show. But what I got was a real sucking stupidity. I was misjudged by its title name, it has no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (the Hallmark channel broadly released and I think they edited / silenced such content so that it is clean). <br /> <br /> A show that offers an image of the current state of the American / Western family, fat overweight, contaminated teenagers and family events that suck. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each other's homes and change the family routine of each with their new rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or more equitably. In the final section, each mother returns with her husband and tries to conclude what they did with each family in the last days. It is the sucking part of the program where each contestant fights for their rights. I was surprised to see all this instead of seeing some great adult sex stuff. I mean who did this program, more than who gave the name "Change of wife"; It is better to be called as "Change of Mother". In short, it corrupts all the great things that the true exchange of wives represents. <br /> <br /> Wife exchange = Average reality suction.
