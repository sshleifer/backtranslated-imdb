The story line was very direct and easy to follow and contained a lot of comedy to a point where it became boring. Some of the attendees thought it was fun, but I like the smarter humor. <br /> <br /> There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film and their performance was decent considering the script. Lena Endre was good as always. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie, so I can not say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan, this movie might be worth checking out.
