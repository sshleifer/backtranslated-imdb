My dear ... Peter Sellers was one of the most talented actors ever. But his choice of films, let's say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to realize how to use his talents. It would have been better to work with more of the Kubricks in the world of cinema than with the people who made it. Of his later films, only "The optimists of the nine elms" and "Be there" have impressed me of those I have seen. <br /> <br /> That said, Boultings and Sellers made some movies before this. That does not sound so bad, I still have to see "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - at least in the sense of using the sellers well to a certain extent. But, "There is a Girl in My Soup" is really a bad movie and a risky choice by Sellers in terms of character. In his 1955-64 films, one can usually expect at least one very ingenious twist and always an enigmatic conviction in their roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic protagonist. It is almost Vendors playing a cad Niven without joviality. Certainly it does not convince him, he does not try it, nor does he create an interesting character. He should have left those parts to masters of softness, like Cary Grant, and concentrate on those dramatic and comedic roles for which he was famous. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers do not really establish any genuine chemistry; This is not an easy and great romance like the one perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is a very artificial aspect, all the way. I know it's part of Danvers's character that he's a dry salesman for ladies, but he does not really change that in a convincing way. The sellers also have a very pleasant way of playing "charm" ... this character really has no depth, and really does not win the sympathy or interest of the viewer. Sellers follows the movements in a way that one would not believe possible by remembering the magnificence of his astute and iconoclastic performance in "Lolita." <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about the plot, the direction or the characters, as they frankly leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anemic, complacent, misguided and slightly boring movies I've seen in my life. The non-identity of a "vehicle" for the undisputed talents of sellers. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
