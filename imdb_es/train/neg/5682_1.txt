This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst I've seen in my life. I'm a big gore fan, but most of the deaths in this movie do not show. It simply shows us the corpses, and the only death scenes they show in this movie are terrible. The graphics are so obviously false. The actors are also terrible. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this sh * t movie, but I had to submit to real images of animals that were hit at the beginning. If I could qualify this as a -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's rubbish. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it.
