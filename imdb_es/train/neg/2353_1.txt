Madhur has given us a powerful Chandni Bar movie in the past. His next film, page 3, was one of the worst movies of all time. Apparently, it tells the story of some upper class people in India. After seeing a scene in which the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I wanted to spit and break the DVD. Coincidentally I did it. The reason why the film contains scenes of child pornography and sexual abuse. I literally vomited and was surprised to see a movie that showed naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show the children completely naked. One of the rich likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this movie. I am surprised to know that this movie was a success in parts of India, otherwise, Super Flop in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. I'm from the United Kingdom, and this kind of thing makes me sick, it should not have been released in the UK.
