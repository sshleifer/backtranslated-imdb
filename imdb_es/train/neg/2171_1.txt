This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history: right next to the passionate defense of Ed Wood for transvestism in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> The theme: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; Bohemians play it. The Russians, who speak a very questionable "Russian" and have an unconvincing accent when they speak English, play it in the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If one is not interested in bridge, one: - even in spite of the big cast - it is not likely that he is very interested in this strange movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well, Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter, since Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by fetish writing.
