After having read many of the comments here, I am surprised that no one has recognized this as basically a new version of an episode of the Twilight Zone of 1960 called "Mirror Image", starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating a ghostly story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this tedious dream. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a movie, there should be a little more substance and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and meaning are two things that are missing in "The Broken". Yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, no character in the movie has a cell phone! And even though a car accident is the event in which the story is told, there is never any reference to an insurance company, the person driving the other car or the police that you would have been required to perform a report. My advice: ignore this hole and look at the original instead!
