I got the library DVD with the hope of getting a good idea of ​​how things happen in the background in a large opera production. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The subject had a lot of potential. The sets in a Wagnerian production must, of necessity, be elaborate and impressive, and the history behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we get is a lot of videos of people moving around great landscapes, they help vaguely along with a comment that did not catch my attention. I found myself listening mainly to the background clips of the music of the operas. I was impressed by the enormous enormity of the effort required to make a production of this kind, which turned out to be quite good and the next time I'm at the opera, I'm sure I'll remember that part in this video, but I felt somewhat cheated. For the lack of comments and detailed explanations.
