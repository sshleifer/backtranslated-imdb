Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) goes out with his fishing buddies from Jindabyne, Australia, for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers the body of an aboriginal woman floating face down in a river, things seem to have turned out for the worse. The biggest victim of the weekend is the common sense of men. They do not leave the ravine and, on the other hand, end their fishing weekend with some excellent catches. Then they go out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the lives of men quickly become a disaster. Local media swarm them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudice spring from local natives. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE'S EXORCISM) perceives the deeper meanings of what her husband and friends did, but she has to fight against him through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media show, spread on a slab of the morgue. His murder and subsequent dumping into the water symbolized what lay beneath the city of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and marginalized. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand something of what is happening are two young children: the son of Stewart and Claire, who is being led by a mestizo Australian whose mother was also killed a few years earlier. The young woman lives with her grandparents and is trying to let her mother go in the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems like it? Curiously ?? a method to achieve this (once again, the underlying Jindabyne current is assumed). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne municipality feels what lies beneath its surface, however, none of them is willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here it is seen when it is said that a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming contains the old town of Jindabyne below its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to do so. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting if it is a bit complicated. There are too many stories that need to be explored and simply not done; too many loose threads. The performance was good, but the filming was terrible. Shaky cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just generalized oversight damage production in general. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the symbolic films, NORTHFORK is one of my favorites of all times in that sense. But Jindabyne needed to reach her head above the murky water so she could see her own problems, which simply did not happen.
