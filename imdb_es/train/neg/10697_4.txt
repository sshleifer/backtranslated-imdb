First of all, I thought it was a lack of them to say in the credits that the story and the script were from Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood's best screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it was not the Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was based essentially on the Robert Louis Stevenson story "The Bottle Imp". A good man takes possession of an evil object that will grant him any desire, but will eventually condemn him to hell. It's okay. No one said that the writers should be original. The actors are generally quite competent given the mediocre writing they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks that he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first, this seems to have worked, but true to the code of the modern horror movie, they feel they have to provide a last bit of horror at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. The old horror films got along well by allowing the hero to win in the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumph over evil, no matter what the current crop of filmmakers think. It can give the audience a good healthy scare and make them feel happy in the end. In fact, I think it's preferable.
