['Wow, this movie was bloody horrible. So bad, in fact, that even though I did not pay to see it, I still wanted to get my money back. <br /><br /> The movie is nothing intelligible. It&#39;s a mix of science fiction clichés that were enhanced by much more expert filmmakers. The performances, especially by the protagonists, were exaggerated in a less attractive way by Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character&#39;s dialogue. He is too taciturn, without any hint of irony or sense of humor. Besides that, it does not make sense, nor the plot, or lack thereof. <br /><br /> The visual effects are fine, but not enough to say &quot;oh wow, that&#39;s great&quot; and it seems that they simply throw themselves &quot;to be cool&quot; instead of being a good plot device. <br /><br /> The soundtrack was another mix of things that never really creates any kind of humor. Again, it seemed that the director was just throwing songs in the movie in an effort to &quot;be cool&quot;. <br /><br /> Which brings me to my last point. Maybe if the director really cared more about the plot, the story and the dialogue instead of trying to &quot;be cool&quot;, he would not have made a cliché as stupid as that of a short film. <br /><br />']
