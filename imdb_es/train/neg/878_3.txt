I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote excellent scripts like "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and / or directed such nonsense , a sad nonsense like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clich√© that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script sinks into its nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which the character of Janssen tests the character of Drivas to make sure he is not gay. An ugly sequence, but unfortunately one that could easily play in a movie today. The "ethnic" jokes are now totally verbal, but the "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, fun for the family."
