Exactly what you would expect from a B-Movie. Drift, free nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and special effects with cheese. Of course, it could have been better, to have acted better (definately) better written, directed, etc. But then I guess it would not have been a B movie. The actors almost stunk, in fact, this looked like an episode of the vampire's death or something, except with a lot of blood, blasphemy and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be highlighted. She is absolutely the queen of the cry of the new millennium. It's not that acting really matters in these films, but she was better than any of the other actors. She's also very sexy, in that plastic suit suit she wore throughout the movie, wow! Your back is absolutely dazzling in that outfit, I say it every time you turn around it can help, but verify it. And almost at the end of the film, the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely surprised. <br /> <br /> So if you're a lover of the looser horror movies (like me), look at this. If not, you should probably avoid it at all costs.
