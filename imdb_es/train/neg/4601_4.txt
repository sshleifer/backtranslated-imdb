I do not know anything about the previous work of the writer or the director, so I had not brought any prejudice to the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the implausibility was piled on the implausibility. Each twist of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag more bloodshed, frightening makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer looks like a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. . It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the vagaries of the narrative, but I will give an example of what I think as an excess of explicit blood. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch and takes out the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt). McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a piece of his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's disappearance. (What are the cops going to do, measure their bite radius?) McKenna unscrews Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag he's in, takes an ax and starts cutting Wendt's head. Hit. Hit. Hit. The part of the ax continues cutting Wendt's neck. The air is full of frozen flesh nuggets flying, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He takes it off when it's over.) McKenna then takes out her frozen head to a small fire that she has built. She sits on the floor, bends down next to her, takes some pictures of a woman she just killed and shows them to Wendt's head. "Do you remember her? We could have done it if it had not been for you," he says to the head. "Duke, you've always liked bonfires, right?" he asks. Then place the head over the fire. We can only see it burn, but we can hear the grease sizzling in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want this type of garbage to be censored. I just wonder who likes to see these things. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the movie. Well, I will mention an example of "implausibility", since I mentioned the idea. McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark, bare hut. He knows he's going to be hit halfway in the next few days. (He literally invited the heavens to do so). What would you do in this situation like Poe's? This is what McKenna does in what may become the last night of his life. Find a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbate (successfully). Give that man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza the Hut gets involved in some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often hand-held and wobbly. The dialogue has lines like "Life is a piece of shit, or it's the best of all possible worlds, it depends on your point of view." A wide-angle lens is used that turns normal faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, McKenna, walks towards us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> He is also a hero. First kill a man for $ 13,000 by hitting him on the head several times with a heavy statue, then with a potted plant, before finally flipping a refrigerator over the body. (This bothers him a little, but not enough to prevent him from insisting on payment). Then, I hope he has the right order, he kills Wendt by tearing part of his neck. Then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavy ones for it, although by almost any moral calculation they had nothing to do with it. Then he burns the head chief (Baldwin) alive. Then, by disabling the two minor children, he exploits them deliberately, although one of them is not entirely unfriendly. And we're supposed to be encouraging McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not deaths by cartoons like those in Harry the Dirty movies, bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first, the murder for $ 13,000, is done with enough clumsiness to resemble what could happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another human being, as Hitchcock had shown in Torn Curtain. But that scene does not lead anywhere of importance. <br /> <br /> Some people can enjoy this, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. Some worthy things on screen here.
