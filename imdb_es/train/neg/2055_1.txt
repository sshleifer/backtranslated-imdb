There is absolutely no reason to waste time with this "movie". The original said everything and still remains. Or read the book or investigate the story, and you'll find that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? Your sister could have done a better job! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story unfolds, the settings and locations did not look anything like Kansas. The original is fascinating, from the filming of the place to the use of the real participants, the weapons and the belongings of the victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones soundtrack and Conrad Hall cinematography ... The original is now available in widescreen DVD. Let this turkey die a quick death.
