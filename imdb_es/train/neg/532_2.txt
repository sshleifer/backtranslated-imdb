Only PPV gave this. I do not want to waste a lot of time on this, since most of the posters here put it better than I could, but I wanted to say some things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which one was more fun: Redgrave chasing small moths and tripping over his nurse; Groaning up close that her "precious" son (whom she and Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has become an assault on the road; that the deaf Ann mingled with Peggy Lee; or Crypt Keeper's horrible CGI, Annie, who looks at her youngest self. <br /> <br /> I never bought the Danes like the younger Redgrave. I also did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, it's better to have Mom give her some lessons! I had no idea why any girl (or Buddy) would cheat herself for the vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as tearful and inconsiderate as she is, Luc is a lazy retard in crack, and I did not get spoiled by any of them! The night gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
