If you really enjoyed the 2002 film Resident Evil, you should see it instead of losing two hours and you will never come back. I can not believe that nobody has commented that this movie is just a cheap imitation of RE. First, a "special" command force is the only defense for an installation with a computer matrix that has an AI and a holographic projection. And this "Hive" scam has a series of traps that inevitably kill one squad member at a time. There is even a chess reference in the names of the codes, which was in the RE dialog. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", the nemesis of the film, is a kind of biological creature, with a color very similar to that of a necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components as a super mutant of RE. Therefore, a comment from Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming some credit for this story. <br /> <br /> Obviously, they are not the same movie, but the writer had the idea of ​​seeing Resident Evil, I think. .
