This version of "Moby Dick" insults the audience by claiming that it is based on Melville's novel, even going so far as to show a false phrase from the first chapter instead of the famous "Call Me Ishmael". In addition to having an atrocious performance, including John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) will go to review and change a famous novel just to increase its chances at the box office. All The beautiful and poetic language of the novel has been completely eradicated, and Ahab has been changed from an obsessive, blasphemous and obsessive madman to a misunderstood and misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiancé (!) move away from him after seeing his wood. leg. Add to that the standard evil brother who wants the fiancé to himself, and a different ending!
