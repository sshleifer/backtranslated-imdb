I debated whether or not to check the spoiler box. Since 99% of this program has probably already been seen by any Scrubs follower, it probably does not belong to the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Sample clips. Grrr. We all knew that Friends were going down the tube when they started with clip shows ... and five and a half years after Scrubs, they left and fell through that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if the writers simply could not bother writing that week and simply told themselves "let's show other fun things". It did not work <br /> <br /> To begin with, showing all the times that people have fallen is not fun when taken out of context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging in his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was hanging in his banana hammock. <br /> <br /> Secondly, for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD's fantasies, one was Turk's dream, another was not his fantasy, although I forget which one. <br /> <br /> And that is the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We have seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? That's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown in the latest compilation ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben died ... and JD told him how proud he was of the. <br /> <br /> But even seeing those moments again did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode of all. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, do not let your program develop in the same way as Friends, keep it cool, fun ... or wrap it up.
