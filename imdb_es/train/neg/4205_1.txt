THE ALARMIST is so openly programmed that you've wondered why the hell a promising actor like David Arquette agreed to participate. It has to be one of the weakest plots that I've seen and without any kind of humor, it borders on the edge of the tedious. He staggers to a terrible conclusion that seems to happen only because the director got bored and just wanted to finish quickly so he could go home for dinner. Keep away!.
