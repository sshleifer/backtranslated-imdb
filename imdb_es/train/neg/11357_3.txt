First the good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they do not go for the tricks of gotcha. The film is based on the real story of the culminating moment in the history of humanity, and even presents one of the real participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: it's about FLIES, for krissakes! Fly with big googy eyes, it's true, but nevertheless, it flies. Remember when I compared the "Underworld" movies with rats against cockroaches? That was not thought of as a compliment, and I never dreamed that someone would take it literally. This one has even less empathy for it. Baby worms? Ugh In one of those strange confluences of Hollywood group thinking, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as "Space Chimps", also about creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go rent "Apollo 13" and watch A movie rated 9 on the REAL space program (RIP).
