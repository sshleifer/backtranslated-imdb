Possibly the worst movie I've seen; I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes. The only people who laughed in the theater were teenagers. Do not get me wrong, I love stupid and stupid movies as much as the next girl, but the whole premise, the writing and the humor suck. I thought they were going for a feeling of "Napoleon's Dynamite": strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, he ended up being forced, clumsy and strange. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt absolutely bad for the fact that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing. <Br /> <br /> Thank you, my God, I did not pay for it.
