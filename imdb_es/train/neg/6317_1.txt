I have no idea what a moron in San Francisco came up with this stupid plan, but apparently they need to get rid of any drugs they are taking and put their analyst in danger. NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a plausible story, if you consider that the alien abduction sequence in "Brian's Life" is plausible. <br /> <br /> This movie is little more than a left current. If the United States and the USSR had abandoned nuclear weapons, the result would have been to eliminate the only real obstacle that prevented the two from getting involved in a war. As bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the time were, they were "proxy wars" fought to keep the superpowers from directly confronting each other. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me think about how realistic it was when some groups of high school students would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone were saying, "Mr. President, some Drastic High children are not eating." and Ronald Reagan would answer "Oh my God, I'd better check my Defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union had collapsed because they could not stand the massive construction of their weapons ... wait, that happened!
