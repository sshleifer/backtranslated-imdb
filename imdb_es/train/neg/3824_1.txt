I feel that the film does not portray Smith historically. The goal of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that was "comfortable" for the leaders of the LDS Church, the historical accuracy seems to have been little concern. The film was designed to be a "faith promotion" experience, not a balanced vision of Smith "as a man". I have dedicated myself to studying the life of Smith and I have read both the LDS works and the LDS works. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and acted well. However, this was not a realistic portrait of the beginnings of Mormonism or of Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> There was a significant period of time to represent an accident that Smith had when he was seven years old. While this event was certainly important in shaping your mental perspective, it seems that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a comprehensive vision of Joseph Smith. Another point in portraying Smith's teenage years is that the film says nothing about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that, while the film shows Joseph Smith entering nicely into wrestling contests, does not show how he sometimes lost patience and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was not historical in any way and should be considered a fiction film about a man. I would not recommend watching this movie for any other purpose than entertainment.
