This is said to be a personal movie for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but he changed things to adapt to the characters, who are detectives. These detectives come out with beautiful models and have no problems getting them. It sounds more like a playboy millionaire filmmaker than a detective, is not it? This whole movie was written by Peter, and shows how out of touch with real people. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, in fact. And it leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who in real life would marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but she's much better and has a larger part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; additional. She does not have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated to begin with. In short, all the characters in this film are people with whom very few people can relate, unless you are a Manhattan millionaire with beautiful supermodels at your disposal. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snoring fest. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with internal jokes, and bored with the rest.
