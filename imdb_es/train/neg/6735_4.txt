The best I can say about this movie is that it is well accelerated. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances of the actor who plays the promised boyfriend Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor who is helping to criticize the possible attire of Messing in an early scene brings a charming, absurd and winning quality to the process. Well, that's all on the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I love, is much more credible expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene in which he is trying to be professional or supportive. As others have said, it seems that it has no emotional investment in this company other than closing it as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to take the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate to do it, but she is simply not an actress strong enough to accomplish all this without help. Give an "E" for effort and a "C +" for achievements. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could have helped Messing would have been an Irons-esquire performance with brilliant caution from the actor playing his ex-fianc√©, Jeffrey. On the other hand, their performance is weak, petty and irresponsible. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this more, I would obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass the time if you have nothing else to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching "My Best Friend's Wedding" again.
