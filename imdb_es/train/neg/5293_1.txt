I picked up this video after reading the text in the box, the story seemed good, and I had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of observation, I realized how horrible his performance was, he walks and talks so stupid all the time, it's false and it's not convincing. It does not end there, almost ALL the characters act so bad that it's ridiculous, the only acceptable performance was Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide from the beginning and you do not see him again, you do not even know why he did! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! Many times I was tempted to stop looking, in fact I did, in the middle of the session I decided to stop looking and turn it off, I went to the IMDB to check what others thought, I found no comments (I was not surprised). so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and come back to finish it, then come here to discuss it. The only good thing (for me) was the theme of the high school rock band, the occasional parts of playing the guitar and singing, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and direction ... Terrible movie.
