I really enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and I was surprised when I saw the trailer for this film, and even more so when I discovered that Bilal had directed it himself. The movie, however, was a big disappointment. The images are not close to the rich and gritty texture of the original works of art, and the story is poorly told. It seems that Bilal chose to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and does not do a good job either. <br /> <br /> The nicest part of the original graphic novel was The friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. Both were outside of their right time and place, forced together by circumstances. More than anything, they were fun and enjoyable. It is not like that here. Nikopol has no discernible personality, and Horus is a pompous imbecile who just wants to have sex. Even though the film is French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We have all seen movies that we enjoy, but we would not recommend them all, for some reason or another. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, except perhaps as a warning not to overdo his talent and resources. Bilal is a great storyteller, but obviously he is not a master of all visual media.
