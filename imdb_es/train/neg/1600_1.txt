The biggest success of National Lampoon remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was funny, noisy and of good character. <br /> <br /> Exactly the opposite of all other National Lampoon movies. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE, do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") of "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this tangled mess. This meeting is as hilarious as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star, and that is being generous. On the other hand, I always thought that most of my former classmates were also demons, vampires and serial killers.
