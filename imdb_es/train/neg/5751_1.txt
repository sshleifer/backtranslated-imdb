The film must have been filmed in a day, there are scenes in which you can see the reflections of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light of the stage that mixes with the actors. The plot and the lines are really horrible without even the smallest detail. Inspiration (At least as a suspense genre film). Everything that has to do with Poe in the film, has a superficial and childish focus. The movie is full of details and it's not exciting. If you want to watch a funny movie for a relaxing night with friends, then enjoy it (as I did), but there's no way to take this movie seriously!
