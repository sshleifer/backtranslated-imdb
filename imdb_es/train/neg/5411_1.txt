['I&#39;m a big fan of movies that make you think. I&#39;m still thinking a lot about this, seven minutes after the credits are over. What really confuses my neurons is the attempt to understand the relevance of the plot of the naked girl who caresses her slippery oily body, made extra sticky by being filmed in a cheap video. This happens three times and I was sure it would be explained at the end. I trust the filmmakers to justify this tempting attempt to attract viewers. Was not. <br /><br /> The movie has to be the most apathetic I&#39;ve found in the genre. The sets look like a cross between a set of Dr Who from the 70s and the ill-formed idea of a living room painted with a sponge. The lighting is unimaginative (if your sets are going to be so bad, at least shoot them in the penumbra to hide the drywall and create an environment). Of the kidnapped quartet, the girl stands out for being particularly lame, but none of them is given a personality. The plans of foreigners to dominate the world are simply stupid: all they need is a contraceptive pill and their problems are solved. Most of the movie consists of people running through the corridors. Yes, it really is so exciting. The special effect of the &quot;lightning cannon&quot; is ... curious, to say the least (what good is a weapon that requires a concentrated explosion of 15 seconds to kill, and even then the guy returns for more?). The script is like a bad episode of The A-Team, and the women&#39;s hairstyles come from the same era, so they look like school teachers instead of an advanced team of murderous alien invaders. When we can finally see what the aliens look like, they are in suspended animation and never get out of their boxes. The resolution of the story: the extraterrestrial traitor simply has a few words with the invading fleet commander and, without thinking twice, he goes to his house - it is truly the sign of a writer who never had a more complex idea than a Saturday morning caricature (I mean the bad those who have no plot, action or characterization) in your life. <br /><br /> But seriously, what about the naked girl? Was it really fair for them to justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to increase sales?']
