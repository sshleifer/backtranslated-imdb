Only the most ardent fan of DORIS DAY could find this even bearable. When you think about the wealth of material available for a story about the most famous blackout in New York City, a movie that could have dealt with many real-life stories of what people had to face, this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of Originality to tell stories. <br /> <br /> Once again, Doris is outraged because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her Connecticut lodging, took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning. with a man who had done the same, wandering around the house by mistake. <br /> <br /> No one is able to save this disaster, nor Doris, nor ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT As directed by Hy Averback, it is the weakest vehicle on which Day she found herself committed to making the film due to the machinations of her husband and unable to get out of it. Too.
