I did not expect much from this movie, a little fun fun. Wuthering Heights could become a plausible, pleasant and soapy modern story, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to get rid of the talent of the people involved in such a diluted version of the original material that it is incredible that they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights. Ignore the fact that it is a story of people who, in essence, are unpleasant, mostly unfriendly and often cruel to each other. It changes the very nature of certain characters (Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have a bone of complicity in her body), they took away her blind idealism and turned her into an intriguing whore. Heathcliff is a horrible person who psychologically tortures most people in his way, but in this version, Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in her charge. The dialogue is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver some of that with serious faces. Instead of deep or real emotions, we know that they mean something when they shout it in someone's face. I have read reviews about the early 90s version, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights," featuring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and said that it turned an intensely dark Gothic story into a foamy bodice. Comments slightly valid, but the MTV version goes a step further, by using the basic structure of the story to offer beach lovers more cunning than really bad music.
