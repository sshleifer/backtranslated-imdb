This is the worst sequel to the world of cinema. Again, it has not since. The killer keeps killing for fun. But this time he's killing people who are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the stupidest movie in history. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. If you value the precious hour during this movie, then do not see it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you what made him do it. Because it simply does not combine the original brands of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not let your children see this. Adolescent, small child or young adult, this film has that kind of impact on people.
