Considering its popularity, I found this movie a big disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from this movie. After all, it is one of the best-known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is not interesting. It is also a very spoken movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character to which it can take root, since the intentional hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and can not hide the obvious imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be a great art, but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me. I recommend you skip.
