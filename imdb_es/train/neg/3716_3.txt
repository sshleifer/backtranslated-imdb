The main character Lance Barton is killed and to heaven before his time. When heaven learns of the error, he is given the body of the old rich and old deceased, Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old body of a white man who still behaves like the young black man is perhaps funny. If you see him done by an old white actor. In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white man". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not work as expected: the "illusion" is not well transported and The love story is not credible at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black man, because the old white person that everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes, it is a great challenge for the spectators "suspension of disbelief".
