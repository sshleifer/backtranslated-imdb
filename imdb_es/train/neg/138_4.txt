The good: this movie I liked because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that really scared me. The acting was not so bad, and the assassin of "Cupido" was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The bad: the plot and the plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just was not much to do. The way the murderer killed his victims was very horrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore. <br /> <br /> In general: a good scare, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
