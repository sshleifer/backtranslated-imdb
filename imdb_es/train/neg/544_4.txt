PROS: the performance of Akshay Kumar (is it just me or this guy always manages to beat AB in their movies together?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: All the first hour (the jokes were flat, at least). Every scene that involves Rajpal Yadav. Greater stupidity in the decision making of AB. Let me make this clear, he believes that brutally insulting his son's soul in every way possible (which will probably ruin his relationship beyond repair) is a better way to make Akshay finally take some responsibility and then tell him the truth . WTF? He considers that Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father will soon die from cancer, but believes that insulting him will make him stronger. Am I the only one who does not see logic here? Easily the biggest flaw in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Akshay is becoming a double. LMAO !! They tell us that he finished first at the university each year and has an MBA degree. But when it comes time to support himself, and his pregnant wife, it becomes a trick. Haha How do you really request a normal job in your field? Or hell, in any other place where your life is not in danger? This is an incredibly silly script. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this kind of melodramatic shit. Everything is pushed by our throats to feel sorry for the character of AB, which I could not. Everything reminded me too much of Srk in KHNH (what I hate). This "please, sorry for the boy with the disease" shit has run its course. I felt more like vomiting than sympathy for the OLD MAN. I could not see the last 20 minutes or so for that and, therefore, I had to fast. all. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: Waqt is too stupid to call it a good movie. His obvious director, Vipul Shah, pointed this out to emotionally fragile girls and old people who could not care about a story that really makes sense. Give them some decent images of songs, elegant outfits, lots of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power, and they'll gladly turn into shit like this.
