I mean really, how could Charles Band, the head of the Full Moon, let out a stinky ball like DEMONICUS? I mean, I should never have the green light to start. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranus, except that he is a bad guy. Then the writer or director goes out of his way for a bad ending. This is a bad ending, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes to a deadly cavern, then an image of Chimera comes to life, however little he can add and pursue it. Then, when she is walking home to the FUNHOUSE. A statue that has been destroyed for centuries reappears without any reason to collapse on it. I mean, that does not make sense. What the hell was Charles thinking, allowing this heap of vomit to be made, with four different film companies that were so desperate for the movies? They could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
