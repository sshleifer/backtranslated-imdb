Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, cheap and very entertaining. I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily lives. This is one of Warner's few melodramas that simply does not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of a newspaper that resuscitates the 20-year-old story of a murderer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance but is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. HALF PENSION. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad performance of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell on the second tracks really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of the previous Hollywood code. The direction of LeRoy is full of innovative visual touches, but it can not overcome the bad acting and the funny situations without intention. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Film (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
