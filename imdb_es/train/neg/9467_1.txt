If you liked the Grinch movie ... go see that again, because this was not a good Seussian movie translation. The Mike Myers Cat is probably the most annoying character to "decorate" the screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a horrible sound, which is about the only laugh I heard in the theater. Even children did not like these people, and children laugh at anything now. Save your money and see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you are really looking for a fun family movie for the holidays.
