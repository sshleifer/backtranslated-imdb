There were moments that were disturbing, but each one was canceled for horrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange stories like this is that he feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work feels that way sometimes, and like his interesting shows and movies, it's too long. And, unfortunately, this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's the limit for this. I guess it affects the feelings of the teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it just does not make the characters nice enough to worry about their destinies ... whatever they may be. The final scene leaves everything ambiguous.
