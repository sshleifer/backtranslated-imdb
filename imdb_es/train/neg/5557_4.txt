Okay, but does this make this a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. There is not much to recommend. I found it very slow, tediously, in fact. It is also predictable to a large extent. . number one and two were predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was pretty corny at times, which I really do not think fits this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment. He's a pretty decent actor, but I felt he played his character way too much. I guess it matched the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I would have liked the movie. Also, there were some pretty bad topics. .Nold Vosloo returns in the title role, but he is given little to work on in this film. The character has not really evolved, as expected. Well, this is my opinion. Anyway, for me, while this movie is not abysmal, it's pretty bad. My vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
