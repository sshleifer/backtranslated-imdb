After watching this, then read the summary on the back of the DVD, then think about the real movie ... I got a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed that it was a baby with Down syndrome walking through an endless forest where people drive 11 miles per hour and stop for no other purpose than occasional lesbianism without flavor. Where (zombies?) Come out of nowhere and (vampires?) That (seduce?) Citizens of pure heart on their way to save the world. Neither zombie nor vampire are notably among themselves. The only fight I remember was to take off the panties of Bonny Giroux's walrus. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe it was because we were seeing it spread out in widescreen and we were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining ... In conclusion, my final thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development , antagonism, theme Matter, and then acting the totality of this film. He made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
