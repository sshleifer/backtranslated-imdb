A film about a group of filmmakers who want to make a documentary about a new type of surf in waters infested with sharks. As an absolute fan of movies, including some kind of vicious animals or monsters, I thought that this could be my kind of movie ... it was not! This should be more a guide of how not to do it! It has a lot of accidental humor and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene chases the main characters * rolling *, the feet are obviously shaking the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were only because of the lack of talent among the actors, the shamelessly stupid dialogues and the hilariously stupid crocodile, at least it would be worth laughing, but it gets worse: I guess those responsible for this film realized. How weak it was, so they thought about the old idea that "sex sells" ... Totally, I mean FULLY for no reason one of the leading actresses shows her breasts to the beast. And somewhere in the beginning there is some kind of "makeup" without meaning. This is the last ingredient that makes the film absolute rubbish for me. It's amazing how people really spend their time producing such waste! If you're looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie!
