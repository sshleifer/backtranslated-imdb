Since Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about its sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (a) is a classic animated feature with all high quality, great music. Score, and it goes to a general audience. In contrast, Little Mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children, as it is spontaneous, reflects a child's personal perspective, the music is more inflatable and less dramatic, and the ending feels like a break. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 starts when the baby Melody is introduced next to the Ariel family. Suddenly, without any visual cue to help the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, the baby is being attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. The crime of Morgana in broad daylight and its spontaneity, eliminates the potential drama since it happened so fast. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Melody seems superhuman, which I defend is the way most children imagine themselves. This quality in Melody's character clearly stands out towards the end when she fights with Morgana without an inch of fear on her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of problems with Ariel, except the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father by restraining her from the ocean, while King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music moves more emotionally in the first. This sequel has a lot of songs, but not so much orchestral work. It's great for the little ones, because it does not take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a spirited song and all those who play in the water. Definitely, it is more directed to the children, because instead of the end being solemn and leaving you impressed, this ending leaves you thinking: "It's recreation time!" Ultimately, this movie is fun for children, so we should let them have fun.
