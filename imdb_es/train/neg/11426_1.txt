Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the producers of the film think they are? ABSORUTE THE WORST, the most insecure movie I've seen since I can remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to sign up for IMDb and make sure that the rating of this "movie" falls. <br /> <br /> My God, I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunken girl, so while she faints, I'm REALLY going to walk around my room for HOURS asking frantically "WHAT DO I DO?" Jesus heather, get over it and grow ... and I would like to move on. feeling towards idiot producers ... and while I'm at it, instead of this movie being all about a pathetic excuse for an emerging story, it might have been more appropriate to focus the plot on a character that is mentally unstable. .. as your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know that the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning I jumped into the sky with emotion in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch , get a grip ... <br /> <br /> What a talk! and keep in mind that there are many many more faults and frighteningly stupid aspects in this bad movie, but I'm so sick of thinking about it. In short, if you are an intelligent person, you will hate this movie, and if you are not an intelligent person, then you will love it ... it is as simple as that.
