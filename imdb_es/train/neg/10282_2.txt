I did not expect this to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so horrible either. I hated the maternal character so much that I had to convert the channel. I returned it, hoping it was only part of the movie, but no. And for the daughter to sit there, feel embarrassed, or almost out of work, or driven to madness in her own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would stay fast at the nearest hotel if that would be annoying in MY house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all. <br /> <br /> I did not buy any of that. I tried to give him several opportunities, I really did. Sorry.
