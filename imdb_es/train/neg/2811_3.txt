Will you ever make movies without nudity and sex? This happened at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God my son was out or I would have been scared if I had seen the soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies do not care who they offend or corrupt? The children may have been looking after the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The performance was good and I liked the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys, but that's to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good in his role. If the writers, directors and producers simply stopped putting a lot out of place for the sex scenes. What has to happen to stop going in that direction? Where can I complain?
