Loaded with good actors, I expected much more from "Deceiver" than it was delivered. The plot is extremely artificial and manipulative. The many flashbacks only increase the confusion. Credibility flies through the window and with the end it becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would strongly recommend to anyone who likes their movie plots that they base themselves on something that is at least possible to avoid "Deceiver" because they will feel very frustrated. It may not be modern enough to understand, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the end. Blending the line between reality and lying simply does not work because the whole movie does not make sense. - MERK
