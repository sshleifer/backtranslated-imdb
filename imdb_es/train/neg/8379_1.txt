As some of the other reviewers have alluded to above, I'd like to know what imbecile actually read the script and said, "Yes, that's it, this is the next movie we're going to give the green light!" And whoever that person is, the head should be examined to determine the actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for allocating money for this to be done after reading the script, I would love to give you my email address and maybe you would like to give some more money. This movie is atrocious in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are fun, at least they can be. They have done some good movies and have had some incredibly fun performances along the way. But here, the premise not only defies all logic, not only is acting terrible, it's not just an offensive film from beginning to end, it's not only the most amateur direction you can find, but they really want you to do it. Pay to see this movie. Maybe if it were free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Usually, I am inclined to write a detailed and detailed review on why this movie is so bad, but it is enough to say that they let my brevity speak. This is the lowest common denominator film and is as unromantic as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 Make my list of the ten worst movies of all time!
