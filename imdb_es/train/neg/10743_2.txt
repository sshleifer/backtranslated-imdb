This movie is really bad, with a script full of "memorable" lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it. Only two short tracks (30 seconds or more) are repeated constantly throughout the entire film. <br /> <br /> In short, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
