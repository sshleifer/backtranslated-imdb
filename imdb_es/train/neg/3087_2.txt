A group of extremely unpleasant A-holes are tormented by lame puppets that an elderly night watchman has kept locked in a movie camera for twenty years for no reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie. simply from the corrugated MST3K of the film. But I've seen the real movie and I can say for sure that yes, it's bad, really, REALLY bad. From one of the most horrible "fight" scenes I have ever seen to the stuffed "extraterrestrials" who suffer from lack of movement (I had a monster from My pet that was more scary) until the atrocious performance (I had a monster from My pet that was more charismatic) However, having said that, Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" movies are somehow, and believe me, I have no earthly idea of ​​how, much worse. That does not suggest that this movie is anything other than garbage, because it is not. Just throwing it around. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: there is no nudity in the movie itself, but there are 2 pairs of tits on the DVD Introduction to the movie <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Gallery of stills; and trailer of this movie.
