As a fan of horror movies, I try to see all the important news of this genre, especially those that are the product of my native cinema. And I can say that the "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as a Russian title) is one of the weakest films among them. First of all, it can not scare even a small child, it moves so slow and so predictable that there is no place for real horror. Frankly speaking, it is bad at all points: from the ridiculous plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors decided to transform the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into a stupid and ridiculous modern thriller from the United States. the previous critic (it does not excite anything) and the work of the terrible and corny actors All the actors, including the main Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are quite famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something like that, and it seems to me that they did not even bother to play, they just spoke their lines in English without any expression, and in the end, I do not really understand why they filmed this movie in English with Russian actors, I think it was their wrong turn, at least they could choose some actors Americans or English to make the main parties look more convincing, the same thing I can say about the so-called "small city funds" is Americans "that were filmed in Estonia and look alike. The only positive moment I found in the "Power of Fear" are the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is good, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give it two stars. In general, if you want to see a good horror movie? Do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I advise you to find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really the excellent movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear" but much, much better.
