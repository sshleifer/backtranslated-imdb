How can a major German television station issue a disaster like this? It is amazing how the main actors avoid all the acting talents. Even the well-known Gottfried John is acting very badly, especially in the scene of the double murder. What an amateur .......! The plan of the screen is very, very extended, maybe to complete 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while you watch! The set is, obviously, very often a blue screen, f.g. The scenes on the ship with the unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, the sound and the dubbing are very poor, probably due to the different languages ​​of the actors, but other international productions handle this much more professionally. Tip: DO NOT look, it's a waste of diabolical time!
