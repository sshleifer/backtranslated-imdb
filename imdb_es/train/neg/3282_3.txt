The Dukes of Hazzard will receive awards from the academy! Best actor and actress 4, the people who can say seriously that this was a great movie. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was a torture to watch. So sad how a weekly half-hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs. The only good thing about this shit was the car! I remember when Daisy was a real threat to look at the 4th. 2. Who is the jerk who decided that Jessica Simpson is good? We know that she can not act, but let's go. In the television show, Daisy was a bitch and a brunette. <br /> <br /> All the members who contributed to this waste of time, please, do not even think about making a sequel, a prequel or anything else that has 2 do with an old TV show. <br /> <br /> I gave him an empty DVD, so this "movie" could be recorded 4 of me. I sat through it and I want to get my money back!
