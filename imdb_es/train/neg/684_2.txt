I could not believe it! Cut sentences? Good pity To know that All true! Do real people ever talk like that? Do not think about it Good girl! Stout mate! Harden the upper lip! Only the reason given the movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such dish. Generally ridiculous movie unless you like to watch endless dogfights in biplane. It seemed interminable, anyway. Think of all the Franchot Tone dialogues folded. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British, they come as Irish. Practical advice: the British cut out words, not sentences. And somehow we managed to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But that's only if we've been in a really good public school (which is private for you).
