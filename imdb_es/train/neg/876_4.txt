Until the last 20 minutes, I thought that this is possibly the worst movie of Jackie Chan (excluding his work before 1978, with which I am not familiar). The final sequence of the fight changed all that: it's long, good and intense; In fact, it is one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to achieve this, you have to sit in a great "comedy" that can amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! Somebody threw a tomato in that guy's face) and the endless "soccer" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a touch" - look to see what it means). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the final fight only, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie's collectors, and still only for those who have already seen at least 15 of their other movies.
