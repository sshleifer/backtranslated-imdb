This film makes Peter an elf in the Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in a suit that is probably not Robin Hood, and ignores all the personal characteristics that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a stuttering idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. And, of course, as all Disney cartoons must have a character that has had too many hits in their heads, they created one of the Lost Boys. The only character that has not been dishonored in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? Darling's parents do not even have time to notice that their children are gone! Probably one of the most significant points of the original story and they ruined it! In addition, the famous children's scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is an impressive piece: there are no thimbles or acorns, one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It's a wonder that she has even lost her shadow and she helped him to hit her. (Despite his shoes and does not make sense to me). <br /> <br /> Ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal. So, know now if you have not known before: this version of Disney has nothing significant in common with the original story, which is not really a story for children, but a great story. <br /> <br /> This only bothers me until the end.
