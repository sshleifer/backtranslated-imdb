To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this film consists of 80 minutes of upset characters drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just horrible, the humor is not funny and all the female characters are idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy, who thinks that drinking is good, that women are designed to please men, and that all those who oppose that vision are geeks. In addition, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, apart from some names and Mr. Levenstein, who is a secondary character in this. The only good thing about this movie are the beautiful girls. Do not look at this movie and do not be fooled by the rating of 5.4, because it is obviously overvalued and does not deserve anything above 2.
