This is a big step down after the surprisingly nice original. This sequel is not as fun as the first part and, instead, devotes too much time to the development of the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best of this series, but his tantrum is toned down in this post. The performances are all appropriate, but this time the script disappoints us. The action is merely routine and the plot is only slightly interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughter to keep me entertained during a "Trance" movie. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, so this film is, at best, visible.
