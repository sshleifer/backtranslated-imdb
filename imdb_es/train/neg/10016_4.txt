"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many films of the 50s about overwhelming teenagers who encounter the supernatural. In this case, teenagers can not pay rent for their meeting place and be evicted. With nowhere else to go, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you may have guessed, once they arrive, some strange things begin to happen. And there is a turn at the end. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's still good entertainment. My favorite character was the moody parrot. Well, let me rephrase that: he did not speak like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things we did not expect from a bird. The film is pure hokum, but harmless.
