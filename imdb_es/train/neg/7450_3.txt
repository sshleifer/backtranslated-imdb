I have seen this film in the cinema for many years, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any virtue in the cinema: Dennis Quaid was chosen as a policeman who never smiles or smiles, while his smile and his smile are Two of their registered trademarks. Danny Glover was chosen as the bad boy, but, once again, the imagination of most of the spectators could not go so far as to believe him in that role. In addition, Jared Leto was not credible as the former medical student. The tension was simply not there, since the killer was known very early. The ending was neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me cared what was going to happen next. All we could hope for was the end of the movie. In short, a disappointing evening at the cinema.
