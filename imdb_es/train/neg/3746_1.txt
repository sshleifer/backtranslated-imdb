As hard as it is for me to believe, with all the horrendous reality shows that have been seen in recent years, this has to occupy the first place for the worst. I still wonder if this was really just a parody made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive, I would be sure he was behind this. Can a rock band lean lower than INXS to do something as embarrassing as this? The premise is simple and moronic. He audits a lot of rejected karaoke to become the new vocalist of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and without success later, the band commits the last act of pathos by submitting to an audition of a group of aspiring talent to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years ago. So they trot all these horrible singers (I thought that American Idol had its share of doozies) that make atrocious interpretations of almost every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then cut out the members of the INXS band who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better rock artists (and more originals) in almost any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the non-creative elements of all the other reality shows. Participants of the reality, boring interviews, lame presenter / presenter, unconvincing "judges" of the performances and the lame start of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows be more predictable? It is clearly a publicity stunt by the band; a last sigh of hope as they rekindle their lost stardom before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had some dignity when he was alive, has to be rolling in his grave. It's not that INXS was a great band, but I had no idea they were so pathetic. If INXS is at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.
