This type of "inspiring" saccharin is enough to make you sick. He telegraphs his feelings as the greatest traffic light on earth. Eliminate your own interpretation and feeling from the audience when making decisions for it. The grand finale is to swim in a crying orchestration that is supposed to work as jumper cables in a dead car; I suppose you would need those indications to feel if you are stupid enough to see a movie as simple and as silly as this one. Streep lights up and you wonder if it really has the feeling of depth on the screen or if it's just that: a screen, lit and turned off like a light. Because I can not, for my life, see how she can find life in such a dubious film. Although it is based on a true story, and an inspiring one, I am sure that the setup, the execution and the performances are presented as a third-rate television movie or a high school drama of wit.
