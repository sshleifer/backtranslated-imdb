Was it a presumption when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the killer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think so. Scenes to make you scream with joy: assemblies in abundance, a strip-tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you wear your clothes seductively, instead of taking it off?), And a climatic battle on skis! Definitely, tune for the beginning and the end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act when the whole plot is happening. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah Does Tori ever get to paradise, or even snow? Do not
