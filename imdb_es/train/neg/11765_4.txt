You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A silly, trite verse that will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we have Ernie Borgnine, ninety years old, coming out of retirement to let us know that, in fact, he is not dead as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul who married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film, Ernie jumps first in feet and portrays the grandfather who joins his lost grandson. We've seen it before. You may enjoy this movie, but please do not say you were not notified.
