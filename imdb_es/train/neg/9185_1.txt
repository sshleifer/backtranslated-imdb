WOOHOO! I did not know someone would make this movie! it is awful! I have written 5 things that can tell you why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> number 1: "it's the biggest rave of all" where is the rave? I could only see some people dancing around ... <br /> <br /> 2. when they are in the rave, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, no people, two shops in ruins and one stage ... and what do they do ?! they drink! <br /> <br /> 3. The worst actors I've seen! The captain and his crew ... horrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people fires a normal weapon, it fires almost 30 times without reloading. <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everyone in the world could fight like professionals! It must be something new ... <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "This is going to be a great success, it's going to be a classic." Sure or foolish ** Anyway, do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. MY EYES are still bleeding!
