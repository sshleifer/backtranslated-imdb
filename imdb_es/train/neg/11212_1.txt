The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with a poor performance, it was simply bland and boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The movie does not work due to the nature of the death, it was accidental, so even though it was a murder, it was not like the guy who set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that reveals that events are like justice to a certain extent. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so is just that this woman calls her sister and listens to her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With some polishing, and better acting could have been pretty good.
