It was a decent movie, in fact I enjoyed it. But the end is so abrupt! There is absolutely no closure and leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What's up with your boyfriend? Do you hook with Grant? Does she come in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance would knock Angela off a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. There is much left in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if he's trying to make room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
