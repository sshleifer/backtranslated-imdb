I sat through this turkey because I had not seen it before, and because the premise sounded as if it had potential. It was a little entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough for the windows to leave the house, but the trees at the bottom are perfectly upright and not a leaf moves! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that time, any credibility that the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. Too bad that all hurricanes are not like this, it would surely help our owner insurance rates here in the Sunshine State.
