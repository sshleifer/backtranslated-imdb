That might be a bit hard for me to say that, but unfortunately so far in his career as a director it is true. Just look what he did until now. They barely exceed the 3 star mark. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons The star of Lucy Lawless and Heroes Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance takes the whole movie. I hope you get a "blockbuster" and that you enter the biggest league of actors, clearly you have the skills. Greg was not that impressive, the typical TV acting style. <br /> <br /> The film is strangely categorized as a horror. The only "horror" is short flashbacks, and they last a maximum of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. Personally I would call this more a "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story, the bad direction, editing and acting (part of Lucy) destroy it. You do not get a real connection with the actors, something that is very important in a story like this. Just sit there watching without feeling anything. It's like watching a bad TV show ... actually I think the TV show would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better yet, stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with.
