I have to admit that I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there's one, I was so annoyed by this movie that it took me a while to concentrate on it. How can you name a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then film it in Texas? The desert plain around Arlington (I think that was the location) does not look at all like the green hills that surround Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Obviously, no one in the movie HAS NEVER BEEN Tulsa or else they would have noticed that nothing in the movie looked like her. Had someone at least not seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds delicate but I can not help it. I saw this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not animate this meandering and bad story of people involved that ARE NOT IN TULSA! Sorry, it can not be more expensive to shoot in Oklahoma. What would happen if "To Live and Die in LA" had been filmed in Toronto? Would that stink? Well, so does this.
