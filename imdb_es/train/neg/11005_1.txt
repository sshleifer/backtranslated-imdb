This film shows a row of sketches, which partly pass one over the other. I realized the death at the end of the film, at first it just irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie appear without recognizable pangs and simply try to evade that fact, using absurdity and obscenity. The attempt to remain in the comedy without any funny detail fails. <br /> <br /> My personal and perhaps a subjective result after seeing this movie (my God, my head hurts every time I call it "movie"): A bold attempt to turn nothing into something big. But it failed. At least the director made something out of nothing. But it's not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Many movies were not as funny as planned, but this is one of them. It is the manifestation of real life of the worst scenario of film making. No. To correct me, it's even worse than that. A movie with bad gags, which are not funny at all. It is not even fun to see the main actor, the writer and the director perish (all three are the same guy) dying in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is very bad for that.
