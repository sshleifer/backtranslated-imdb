It's in the early 80's. There is a group of suspiciously old teenagers. And there is a maniac stalking. Yes, this is slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called jokes? I have no idea Unless your idea of ​​a big joke is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat: in general, it's not a big joke; In fact, it's a joke if you tell the truth. But you have to go. <br /> <br /> The film itself refers to a group of teenagers who have the task of cleaning a bedroom out of service. They realize that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they separate and roam in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The release of the DVD that I saw was that of Vipco. It seems to be cut off from a little violence. This makes the DVD even more useless because, let's face it, a slasher movie devoid of violence is a waste of time. For slasher-film and unpleasant finalist videos only.
