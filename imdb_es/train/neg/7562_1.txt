I have not seen the original, but I just wanted to leave a short note to anyone who moves here: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater to give me back the money or to go back to warn myself not to see it. <br /> <br /> I'll give you two positive winks: the sarcasm of the Cage character at least laughed at me and the landscape of the island was beautiful. I'm sorry, that's all. Here come the boos. The plot of the film is only propelled forward because other characters will not give Cage any direct response, and he supports this! How this could last more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) surpasses me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How could someone read this script and think: "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this bleak picture of how a movie should look like" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
