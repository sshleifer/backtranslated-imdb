This is perhaps the worst attempt of a Zombies movie that I have had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of the filmmaker, the family of the filmmakers or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this movie stink? Let's count the forms ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not hit the effects / gore, since I understand that this is a low budget. But was there even a zombie who was not obese? Let's go! And for a movie in Rhode Island, why was that truck sporting a Massachusetts license plate? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dancing while the soldier "stays in the spotlight". Please, do not put your ex-girlfriend or your friend's sister naked in your movie. This was an ugly film full of ugly people, and you do not have to mention Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not do it.
