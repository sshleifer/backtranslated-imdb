This movie was made for television, so, considering that, I'm not going to steal it as hard as I would with a movie. The script is below average, but manages to be slightly humorous in the points, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly overdone, but that is true for many low budget movies. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this film that I really hated, however, was that 90-95% is filmed in a movie, but in random places, there will be between 5 and 10 seconds where the recording will be recorded in video. You can see because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes were taken later and at that time they did not have the money to shoot in the movie (I guess that's why, anyway), but it's misleading and really makes the movie look more wrong. of what I had to see. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely would not say I enjoyed this movie and I can not recommend anyone to see it.
