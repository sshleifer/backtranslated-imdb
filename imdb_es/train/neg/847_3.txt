The film is about two brothers who are supposed to be the same, but who are not in any way expected to be smart, one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. The geniuses, as they like to call themselves, which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it with personal characteristics, you can perceive it from the material of the title. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I did not like the style of the movie. I think the anxiety, confusion and deep blues that it brings with it have a purpose, but what I do not understand is why there is so much. The film is cheap in the scenes and tells the story basically without any human aspect. It gives the comic as an experience. However, it is visually numbing the viewer, somehow it takes him inside the blues with brief dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cuts, music and abrupt noises. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is very simple, most of what happens is to be represented dramatically for long minutes, mainly in delirium confusing the effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will openly say that this movie did not meet my expectations in the least.
