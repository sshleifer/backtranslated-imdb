I am referring to the word "pedestrian". It seems that the producers of the film forgot that something interesting happened. Faith Domergue can do better than this. She is supposed to be the mysterious and vengeful cobra goddess torn by love by Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, huh?). Instead, she's an ordinary housewife wannabe from the fifties, and the unique, flat expression she uses throughout the movie makes me think that they filmed everything in the early morning before Faith drank her coffee. . As for the rest of the cast, everyone is so "American" so serious that the result is ridiculous. This is explained more productively in Val Lewton in "The Cat People." I think "Cult of the Cobra" really should be titled "Cult of Contractual Obligation". Why, otherwise, so many talented people could walk in silence through a derivative, predictable and slow failure like this?
