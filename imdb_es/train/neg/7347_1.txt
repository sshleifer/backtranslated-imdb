There are no spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far, is horrible. The stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series of the jaw dropping ridiculously ridiculous. As a BBC license payer, after the program I called the BBC complaints to convey my disappointment. I'm surprised that the actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, although they can see that they have lost all direction. It's a good job, it's the last series or the next series can start with the team investigating the death of Santa Claus! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
