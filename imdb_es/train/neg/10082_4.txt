I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It is so amazing. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a collapse in front of a real estate office. What happens? The manager of the office comes out and offers you a job! Fun! The next thing you know is that the two women are going to do it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing sounds true in this movie "Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do". A clumsy dialogue like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling that I had the opportunity to be happy and I did not take it" does not help. There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A daring black maid: incredible that in 2003, a movie was filmed in which there is a daring black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be spinning in her grave. The woman has a husband who gets scared and wants custody of teenage children. Sheesh! No clich√© is left unturned.
