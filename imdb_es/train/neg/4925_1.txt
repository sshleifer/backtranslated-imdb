Please do not waste your time. This film shows the worst of Dracula by Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice (rock music and silly biblical references) and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like movies and vampire novels, and there are many that are very good. But it's not stinky. Even the soundtrack does not help, especially since the film resorts to ridiculous and terrifying classical music instead of "kick-ass metal," according to some. Only a few times I heard some metal; They were mostly tortured violins. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
