I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (since this movie was promoted) but this failed miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing and I quickly lost interest. I'm so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved in this movie. I will continue to be a fan of all of them, but only time can heal my feelings about this. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played the character of Yonica so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; It took me some scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box; If I had paid to see it on the big screen, I would really be fuming!
