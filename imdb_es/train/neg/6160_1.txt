I would not say that this is a bad movie. Unfortunately for me, I have the feeling that the more I know about fencing, the worse it becomes simply because it becomes totally unreal. I have been practicing fencing since I was 14 years old, and this movie describes it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some history of fencing), but most of the other actors, especially the students, seem to be lost.
