To be honest, I did not see all the original "howls", but those scenes that I saw made it obvious that the first howl was a great movie. so big, that seven horrible sequels had to be done. They started with "Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf". I received this movie on my uncle's VHS a while ago when he was giving away a lot of old movies he had bought when Atari was new. I just saw him last night, and he was not really BAD, it was weird. I mean, everything with Sybil Danning who went in three directions with two of his werewolf henchmen was out of place and it was quite unsettling (but a little sexy), Christopher reads about to stab Karen as if he were a vampire, etc. , this movie was really like a kind of hodgepodge of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves, because everything that Christopher Lee (who played the same Dracula) was saying about werewolves practically torn from all the other vampire movies in the heart, the garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT, and the ruler of the werewolves lives in TRANSILVANIA). Not much for acting, but the worst of all was Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie I found myself encouraging the werewolves to rip out his throat, because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING. Anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clich√©, so it does not make sense to say it, you can read it in Wikipedia. By the way, what really nauseats me about this movie is the fact that it is the ONLY movie of the seven sequels that are somehow related to the original (not to mention Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie There is no real horror, almost no werewolf, and simply horrible special fx. 3/10
