I've tried to like this movie, really. When I see him, all I can think is: "This guy gives me the creeps, I would have obtained a restraining order." He also calls CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? "Let's make a film that puts two people with chronic depression and socially inept in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are." From what I have seen in life is that the last thing on earth that we find attractive in a potential partner is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie is clearly 80-ish; Meditative and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, only a few.
