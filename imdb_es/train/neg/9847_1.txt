Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha ha), a cook on a pirate ship who takes over as captain after killing the previous one. Although he has witnessed a treasure that is being buried, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets is blank. Therefore, Dick is forced to look for someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) And helps you to direct a path to the treasure. It is amazing how someone could have financed this movie without meaning. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talent in the movie The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film as the convicted pirate captain. I'm probably grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year he was filmed and kept, so he can keep this out of his resume. Franciosa looks hurried like the handsome power-behind-Scratcher, but both he and the Seller look quite desperate, even with Sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible. They had to know that this movie was bombing even while they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible discomfort: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You will pay for this. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won't do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that is one of the GOOD jokes. It's surprising to me that much of Sellers' prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was available on VHS more than 15 years ago! What if someone approaches the plate and launches in the United States the well-received British television program "A Show Called Fred", starring Sellers, Milligan and directed by the great Richard Lester?
