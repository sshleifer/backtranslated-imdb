This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. The acting is horrible, boring, long, drible. Obviously, because of the length of the final sex scene, they tried to be shocking, but ended up being almost a parody of what the film intended. Complete garbage, I can not believe what a laughable movie was. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie because she thought this would be her big hit hit, an awesome NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult is going to stay with this movie, since the film is developed as an uninteresting episode of OC or something aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
