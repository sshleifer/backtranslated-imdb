My father is a fan of Columbo and I have always liked the program. I always declare my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But nevertheless, keep looking at it. That's your right as an American, I suppose. But my senses were in tune with the series when I discovered that Spielberg had directed the main episode. It was then that I was grateful that my father had bought this show that I really can not stand. I checked his DVD collection and placed this thing when I got home for a visit from the university. My opinion of the series as a whole was not deviated, but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out as most of the low level directors. And that is to do a little drip until the big shot appears (get the word game, HA, HA, as Spielberg did, it's like Jesus before becoming a man.) Or at least that's what I think it would feel like. Columbo's fan of what he would probably like, although it contains little of Peter Falk, I attribute it to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and nobody knew yet where to go .This episode focuses mainly on the Guilty of the crime instead of Columbo's research, as many later episodes would do.
