I thought that this movie was a disappointment that I expected it to be much better than it was. I am very happy not to have paid to see this movie and not to have been sitting in a movie theater for this one. Where to start in this movie, the acting in this movie was normal, the humor was terrible and the general story of this movie was not special. I thought that this movie was supposed to be great, but it was just a cheesy waste of time. I think the acting in this movie was terrible. None of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we had a different Kirk actor than Jay Baruchel, it could have been better, but all the time I saw this movie it looked high and I did not feel like I was not acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie did not have names and had very little effect on this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were some phrases in this movie that were fine, but it's not worth telling your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. Honestly, I think you need to keep the commercials of Burger King. I think this movie could have been better if the writers had gone to a different director. The story of this movie is like any other sexy girl, just OK, a boy's love story ... boring, I think it would have been better if it had been more original, but what a disappointment, nothing. Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to go see this movie. I think you would have more entertainment at the dentist than in this movie. So save yourself the agony and do not see it.
