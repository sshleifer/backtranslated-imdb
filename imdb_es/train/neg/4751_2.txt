First of all, when I saw the Wendy Wu trailer, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the most attractive girls on the Disney Channel, would be doing martial arts and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not have been related to anyone, the fight was not realistic and stunk ... along with the plot. If you really think she is an aspiring Buffy, the vampire killer, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her vocation and wants to become the queen of the home, the observer who annoys her to prepare for a great fight against some ancient evil. The idea was not so original, the film is a waste of time.
