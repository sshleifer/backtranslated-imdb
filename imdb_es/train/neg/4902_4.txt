Almost in the same league as the pretty atrocious color flowers of Yonfan, Spider Lillies reveals the starting point where you can do cutting-edge cinema without limits, or much more in the way of cutting. It is a Taiwanese film, which today is becoming a novelty at an alarming rate, but more than that, we can find very little in the way of the remarkable here. <br /> <br /> You should know. That ostensibly Spider Lillies is also a story with lesbian themes, but in all respects this is nothing more than a plastic tactic to attract those easily seduced and credulous. In several ways, here is a repeat of the recent release of Taiwan Eternal Summer. Then the gay men received the short change treatment, now we have the same with the women. Zero Chou presents, for your non-existent edification, a story that can thrill at most a fifteen year old. They achieved some of the posture of the house of art, but in the end, this translates into a more insane and simply uninteresting foray. <br /> <br /> The Hong Kong angle is presented in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here wearing her most butch look yet. Although somewhat sympathetic in her previous work, Isabella in Spider Lillies is apathetic and lacks in most departments. Either his heart was not involved in it or the whole lesbian drama discourse did not appeal to his sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Makes a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, lonely and is in charge of a younger brother with mental problems. , interpreted by John Shen, who fortunately gives the film its only redemption characteristic related to the theater. The character of Isabella, strangely called Takeko but supposedly from Hong Kong, soon gets hooked with the disaffected young Jade (Rainie Yang of Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a list of complaints because her parents have left her behind and life in general. Sure, the grandmother's component works well and is touching, but otherwise, Jade as the protagonist is as motionless as her counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and a lot of inadequately covered anguish, with Jade at work. as a webcam girl, while Takeko keeps alive his father's legacy with a unique tattoo of a lilly spider stamped on his arm. Jade also wants to acquire this same design, which leads Takeko to explore the inner feelings of the subject through flashbacks and a fairly minimal discourse with the brave jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little speech to write the base about, at least the relationship is memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to be near the end, but as Eternal Summer reminded us not so long ago, there is a gap in light years between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they are about to see sexual content. <Br /> <br /> This cynical expectation seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak history, a boring performance and a general shortage of relics to take with you to the theater, this guy makes Color Blossoms look good, now that I think about it. At least there we got some of Teresa Cheung's breasts. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be removed from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB film festival. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for a pseudo-indie release, not even the soundtrack and the cinematography produce moments of inspiration. That's just as good, since it makes transmitting Spider Lillies much easier. Believe us, avoid it and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
