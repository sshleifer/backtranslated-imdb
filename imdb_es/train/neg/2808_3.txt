A cast of guest stars from films and television series of 1980 (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, among others) in the story of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people begin to appear dead causing all kinds of complications. <br /> <br /> The fact that the thriller is not very good has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating, but there is not enough good material to generate something real. interest. This is best described as the type of movie that gave the Cinemax cable channel the alternative name of Skinamax. I really can not see the point of seeing this unless you need to watch each of the thrillers of poor quality. (I also have to comment that this movie is full of smokers, to the point that it becomes laughable when someone lights up)
