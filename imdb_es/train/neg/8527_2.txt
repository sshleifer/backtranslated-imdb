There are three films with this style of animation that I remember fondly from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I have copies of "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and had not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I had not done it. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and, often, inane. Things would happen without reason and other things without explanation. We are not talking about little things here either; We are talking about key points of the plot! To begin with, the story itself is not that good, but it could have worked if the script had been decent. Not even close. On top of that, the music was horrible! I know that music in films like these rarely has what would be called classical pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to be knocked unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of those movies that I was going to show my children one day, but it was cut. I do not think I can sit through that crap fest again. Disappointed is to put it gently.
