I loved this movie, I admit it. This has to be the best video movie I've seen. Well ... my friend and I decided, for the love of God, that we would rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, and more. When that red neck crashed into the tree by the Sasquatch, we literally saw that part about three or four times, it was amazing (hysterically, of course). And because? Oh, why does the main character have to shoot so much? As honestly, we know that you are in danger, rolling a lot will not help much. But really, if this movie is in your local video store, RENT. It's worth the money and it's not even that bad, as if it was bad, but not incredibly bad. In general, everything amazing will be prepared for you if you rent this movie.
