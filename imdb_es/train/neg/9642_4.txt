I could not believe that part of the horrible dialogue that came from the mouths of people, and the end of the nonsense of the characters in the film was a real problem. And we have the best pictures of Angelique Pettyjohn (Loren Crabtree) and Loren Crabtree. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by the psychic Angelique Pettyjohn takes an alien container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were remnants of Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film a greater value beyond how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Inside the container there is a dwarf alien (played by Ray's son) that begins to scratch people to death. It was very funny to see this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what look like large beetle snails stuck to it, running in the dark. We could even see the little thing stamped and torn on an ET poster, which I found hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the vessel that is hammered to Death of William Fair, after the mini-creature chews on Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. I guess a low budget for ALIEN ... <br /> <br /> Everything ends abruptly, and it seems that they were left without a movie at the end before the bloper roll with the final credits arrives. Talk about the lack of funds ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentioned in the director's comment that they were also not sure if Aldo Ray would manage to film and remember his lines. He just did it. <br /> <br /> Low budget cheese sneezing. It's fun to see it, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
