Looking through the other comments, I am surprised that there are no warnings for potential viewers of what to expect when renting this garbage. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was an Indiana Jones imitation performed competently. What I got was one of the most offensive movies that I remember trying to disown, which surprised me even more by the film's comparatively high production values. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a problem, but if so, be careful ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is to see how Bimbo is raped from behind by the fearsome Tribal Chief, while she watches the dead eyes of her partner's severed head. Everything means renting this movie. Otherwise, I advise you to look for entertainment elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, that scene sums up the movie so succinctly that there's nothing more I have to say about it.
