This is the biggest pile of garbage I've seen. DO NOT RENT! The creators of this movie should be a band to make another movie. Start with some plot, then fade quickly. I think I'd prefer to see the dry paint than the cover. The actors were horrible, the plot quickly vanished, the filming left a lot of work to do. There's nothing good to say about this fucking movie. If you rent this movie you will lose your money. I like National Lampoon movies a lot, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to direct. I feel like I should sue these assholes who made this movie go to waste in the cost of rent and lost time.
