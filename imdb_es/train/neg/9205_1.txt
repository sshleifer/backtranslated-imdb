This movie is horrible. Bad acting, bad writing, bad music. It is simply horrible. Not only is it incredibly misrepresented in role-playing games, but the key elements of the film are poorly executed. May the God in whom I do not believe have mercy on the souls of the miserable who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
