Well, I finally saw it. I did not go when he left for the first time because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Fear of how bad it can be, or how disappointing. Although not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the initial screening to the final credits, it was a cinematic experience that I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored farmer who simply knows he was destined for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the threat of evil while being mentored by the wise magician, the rogue pirate and the comic relief, all in one space -opera. <br /> <br /> And that's not to punish Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And for your credit, it gave you new twists that made it very special. <br /> <br /> Then Empire came and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness came on the scene and we learned one of the great movie turns of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw it coming. Of course, I'm convinced that Lucas did not either until he appeared in the script. Come back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really fits. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie: tremendous effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies in its plot, the story that counts. Oh, certainly, a good performance can save a weak plot, but a weak plot combined with a bad performance is a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas is (the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers of some very good actors (Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The plot Oh my, I understand, he's already disabled by what happened in the first two movies, so it's an incredible load, one too much for him to get over. <br /> <br /> First we have the absurd We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virgin and miraculous birth, the "chosen one." Well, this detail is never explained remotely, in fact, the closest explanation is the observation of Yoda that maybe they were wrong Oh, well, it's okay in Then, our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, this same child prodigy turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And will he go back to Tatooine and never know what it was from there? Woohoo! What about that. Proving the old and voluntary suspension of disbelief, eh, George? Anyway, we have this adolescent boy, moody, petulant, complaining, that somehow must become one of the best villains in film history: the great tragedy of Darth Vador, the good guy who falls into disgrace, only to finally achieve it. the redemption at the end. <br /> <br /> How, please, tell me, does this happen? That is why he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a civilization of stars that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the "dark person" who might consult a doctor because maybe, maybe, this futuristic society can do it? ? Something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can do is go kill some children because the villain who is at the root of all the evil they have been chasing for two films tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course it does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to see this nonsense and be moved? How can someone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place? He wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was bad, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth Why? Well, they do not know it. The doctor, who is a droid and he himself is indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion that "she has lost the will to live". Well, oh, it's fine, of course. Maybe he finally realized what he is sleeping with he was sleeping. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows about the birth of Lucas and Leia. He knows who his father is and he knows what's wrong with them. He knows, too, the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches virility and appears with 3PO and R2 (oddly, 3PO's mind is erased, but not with R2, why?) Which says "I think these droids they belong to you ", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was built by what he believed to be" the chosen one "and apprenticed to the Emperor himself, and that by chance was built on this same planet, he says" strange, I do not remember I've owned no droids. " <br /> <br /> Oh, good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas simply invented this as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, unfortunately, the story started to get out of control because he DID NOT KNOW WHAT HISTORY HAD. The plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing about Palpatine had any rational sense at all. And none of this is related to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a last-minute idea, and it looks. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to watch, but completely forgettable. Star Wars will stay in my mind forever. Fortunately, this and the two that precede it will soon vanish.
