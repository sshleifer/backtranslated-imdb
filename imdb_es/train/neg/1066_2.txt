I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it, so I went with him. Upon entering, I felt indifferent about the film, but when leaving the theater I really regretted having lost 2 hours of my life in this warm production. The "stories" are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were horrible. What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a noticeably non-French feel. The clichés about Paris were infinite. Yes, most of them played with clichés about Paris, but after spending so much time mocking the French clichés, they promoted them directly and unfortunately once more. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We did it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: the one directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); Nick Nolte's; the mime one (the worst?); the products for the hair one; that of Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the center of Paris?); the vampire (when I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood). Natalie Portman's, who really looked like a Mentos commercial and was stupid (the blind young man should know that Portman was playing a role when she called him). Again and again he left. He felt interminable. <br /> <br /> I did not like the Coen Bros. I really played with those Parisian clichés, but I did not find it funny. Only annoying. The Gus Van Sant was interesting, but it was so light (and the shot was obvious) that it barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were those of the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby in a nursery just to care for a baby of a wealthy woman. Good irony there. And the segment about the African who is stabbed. It's the best segment of the whole movie, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, that of the middle-aged chubby, was also interesting, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate their limited command of French, but the segment turned out to be condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt forced and uninspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. All in all, with only 10 to 15 minutes of interesting things, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a horrible cinematic experience.
