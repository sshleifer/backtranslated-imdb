The fact that this poor excuse for an amateur hour show was announced at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most independent filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> In the first place, there is something like the art of cinematography. . The fact of taking a camera of 16 mm and aiming at who has a line does not serve for a real film. <br /> <br /> I suppose we should consider ourselves fortunate that the director has not taken someone's video camera ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, independent films are supposed to be about real people. There is nothing real in this movie. None of the characters seems to be remotely human. <br /> <br /> What they see as being is a product of the imagination of a writer who tries to impress his friends by showing them how "great and daring" he is. . <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this is not good writing, nor a good address. <br /> <br /> What's left is a shell from a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance. It's hard to believe that this was one of the best films ever presented ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me lose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
