As is often the case, the impressive and explosive advances of Asian films add to nothing more than lackluster stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious wild dogs who carry out their master's orders. The main characters, an emotionally underdeveloped amoral assassin who faces an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose track of who you're supposed to feel empathy with, by not feeling the slightest emotion for any of the men. If that was the director's fault or maybe the message you stressed that you were trying to say is up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film was full of intrigue and unpredictability, half-heartedly. Point to point was reduced to a monotonous story of survival and revenge. The suspense that was evident at the beginning soon disappeared due to a very uneven music score that made the storytelling potentially effective. And in the end, you got the feeling that all the detailed background information and the introspection of the main characters were somehow very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the transition in story from point a to point b was "Quite atypical compared to American films? therefore, those who are not familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed to be off for most of the movie. It was like looking at a picture taken in fluorescent when it was supposed to be tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but it tensed my eyes. <br /> <br /> Did the movie also enjoy playing tricks for you? An interesting accumulation gave me hope for the history of slow movement until it was diverted to a low-budget, low-speed chase scene. And just when you think you'll get an independent unanswered ending with a mix of Shakespeare tragedy, you realize that it's not an end at all, but a transition to a crazy montage of country music about peace and serenity. <Br /> <br /> Launch some creepy choking scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly returned to savagery and again in reverse, the fascination of Asians for bodily fluids and a horrible music that does not match the film. and you get the sumptuous Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand why each fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions. I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Ultimately, in the end, are we reminded of a true murderer who is still hiding among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
