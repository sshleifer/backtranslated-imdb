Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but he wrote the script for "Casablanca", is not it? Or he did not. Maybe there is more than one Koch in Hollywood, and anyway I do not like Casablanca very much. Wait a minute, yes, there is another Howard Koch playing with Hollwyood. That's the one who wrote "Casablanca." No matter. I will put as much care in this commentary as "Howard W. Koch" in this production, that is, just a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know how this sounds? Someone read the Cliff Notes about Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, since there were no original thoughts aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and turn it into Hollywood with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his big properties among three sisters and, before doing so, asks them how much they want him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and give him a brown snout to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go to the opera in Lear. But in the play, Lear is still alive to regret his decision to give the two thieves his hiding place and deprive the honest girl. He ends up crazy and naked during a gale in the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Children can do that to you. (Take my son, for example.) After all the effort that I wasted in raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) In the end, everyone in the work dies. <br /> <br /> In the movie, obviously, the good sister is morose and suicidal, but when she tries to get rid of herself, someone jumps and saves her, so the ending is more or less happy. That is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy.
