Do not even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on its own merits, but compared to the 1972 original (which is a classic) it's pretty horrible. And by the way, someone commented that the 1972 film is bad compared to the book. This is nonsense, movies should never be judged by the books of those that are taken. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if this were necessary to point out but apparently it does). If you use this criterion for all movies, then "2001" would stink and also "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
