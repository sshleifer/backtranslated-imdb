I must admit that the draw for this film is directed by Eduardo SÃ¡nchez, who directed the successful and popular project Blair Witch Project. Also, this is a kind of alien movie, and it sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that critics hated, but that I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately I felt it for the most part. Altered is a waste of time, so I'll keep this brief review. The premises are always promising, and Altered is no different. Tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take it as a crazy imagining things. The stories about extraterrestrial abduction always have to deal with probes in the holes, so I will not go into details, but you realize that it is very uncomfortable and something you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if? Do they give you an opportunity for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt and capture a live one. What will you do? For this group, it's a joyful reward time, or so they thought. And this is where the film begins to become a snoozefest, with a bad and uninspiring dialogue, and even worse in acting. Even if it is low budget, there are not many redemption factors, either the strength of the story or any help from the cast to make their characters a little interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare of a simple vanilla script, along with some cheap scare tactics employed. <br /> <br /> What is good is makeup. A lot of effort has been put into doing some of the things that I will not mention, because that will spoil only the few elements of what makes this film tolerable. Apart from that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and bloody moments, which is nothing you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Look at this as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in the city: Fiesta, this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously. Trapped by an uninspiring direction, you have been warned.
