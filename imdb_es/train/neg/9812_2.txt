The plot of this film was not only conceived with the ease with which the two psychopaths can kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating, but it was a terrible 'Misery' scam. However, the main reason why I gave this film such a low rating was because it displeased me completely. <br /> <br /> I am not someone who is easily surprised by what the filmmakers say and I have always liked horror. movies, but this movie went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just to get points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people, when they see the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seek', will find themselves reaching the remote control.
