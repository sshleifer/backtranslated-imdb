... they seem to be cheating people to see the qualities of this movie that are simply not there. <br /> <br /> Near Dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action. <br /> <br /> why the script kept its 'big secret' for so long was a mystery to me; I guessed it in the breakfast scene at the beginning of the movie. The moment he revealed himself to the viewer, it was just a case of 'great thing, tell me something I do not know'. <br /> <br /> I found that this is a meaningless film that may have challenged the genre. Conventions, unfortunately, those conventions are that horror films are tense and full of genuine sense of horror. This was unfortunate
