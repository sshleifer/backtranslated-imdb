As you may or may not have heard, there are no real fights between vampires or zombies in this movie. Then, one may wonder why the title suggested such a thing, but it is actually appropriate because nothing else about this movie makes no sense either. There was absolutely no story or plot, only things happened. The performance was incredibly bad, worse than Safeauto. Announcements. <br /> <br /> Not only were there no fights between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies, even in it. Her makeup looked like it was applied by an 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and showed one of the characters fighting the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding) but they used chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance in which I would not totally ridicule all the people responsible for the production of this film is if I knew it was produced entirely by 11-year-old children. <br /> <br /> Really, even with all the criticisms I made. Here, I suggest watching this movie solely because of the fact that it may be the worst movie in history, and because of this it is quite funny. Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
