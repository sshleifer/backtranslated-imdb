The original book of this book was created in the 1950s, but will not work for the television series because most people see the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the subway train near the end was a train of The 1950s painted to look like a train from the 1930s, so the Metro can also play in that game. Hanging the plot of a plot about the Jarrow March was weak, but the 1950s version had students starting to think about the world around them, so I guess making them think about the poverty of the protesters is almost the same. All things about the fact that Japp had to take care of himself were also weak, but they had to put something to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and done it a better long show. It is obvious that this episode is a victim of style over content.
