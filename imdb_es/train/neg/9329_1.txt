One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. My only thought was: "how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video?" This is not worth four dollars in any way, or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to defraud Mexican or Vin Diesel films, but it failed miserably in this. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors who could not find Something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling the lines ahead of the actors, it was very predictable. The Mexican accent of the protagonist was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a caricature. <br /> <br /> Saltala.
