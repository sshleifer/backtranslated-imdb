In his 1966 film "Blow Up," Antonioni had his hero question the truth in a context of young British Protestants. By posing such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements, Antonioni questioned, intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true can be a lie? On the other hand, the film says that we must actively fight and challenge what we see, precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths. Even though the hippy aspects were the most sticky parts of "Blow Up", they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it could have had. It was a very cautious and mature little film. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni discards all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and becomes hippie. The result is a film full of bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy-handed narrations. How could someone, throughout his career show so much moderation and intelligence, do something so foolish? <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a good series of close-ups, while we see a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. It recognizes that, although revolutionaries fight for freedom, to commit themselves to such a militant cause is to give their freedom effectively. And like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger," Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and leaves alone. He does not take orders from anyone. When the police raided his university campus, Mark shoots a man and flees. Then he flees to a nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities, with their billboards and their modern and empty appliances. See the desert as a kind of Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and falls in love quickly. Antonioni offers us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the limitations of modern life, these tree thieves and radical students can now celebrate their individualism by riding in the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the death of Mark and Daria fantasizing about flying the mansions and majestically. Homes of the rich capitalists who killed him. It is Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Collect weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. Knock down the walls before they take you in! <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie had no effect on your audience. They recognized that "Zabriskie Point" was just another egocentric commercial attempt to be radical. A kind of mercantilized radicalism. He felt false and docile. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are not happy with the modern world and the fat cats that exploit you, you must flee into the desert (Mark) or actively fight against the system (Darya). That's very good. But although artists constantly warn us of these dystopian nightmares, most of them can not show us how to effectively manage change. As the end of "Fight Club", nihilism and violence achieve nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors, stimulated by minor technological advances. I mean, what liberated women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a calm and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted movie simply to get more adoration from the counterculture that embraced his previous film, "Blow Up." As such, "Zabrinskie Point" is presented as a very pretentious and stupid film. Essentially, a 50 year old man says "Look at me, I am a bold rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight against "the system", but all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Red", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All these show that the lives of freedom fighters end in failure, although in each case the "spirit of revolution" survives. The message is that you can not make a change, but when you die or fail, the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom. Essentially we must keep failing instead of losing hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", that simply encourage you to explode. Tear everything down. Make it explode everything. Everything is a lie, so it is better to come out with the guns on. These films are born of angry and reactionary feelings, rather than by any common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category of "flight instead of fight". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films like "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show human beings fleeing from worlds they do not like and that forge islands or peaceful refuges for themselves. Both directors are pessimistic, in the sense that Malick destroyed their islands and Antonioni offered no sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films such as "The Lives of Others" by Donnersmarck, "Bound For Glory" by Ashby and "A Clockwork Orange" by Kubrick, treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, in which everyone is satisfied with being slaves of the state, it is the unbridled creativity and the freedom of will of the artist / criminal that keeps the system under control. Simply existing outside the pack, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical eye challenges the status quo. As such, the Donnersmarck film has novelists and artists who undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex, the artist / criminal who fights the Nazi droogs, painting the city with blood and sperm.
