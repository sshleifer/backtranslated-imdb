Robin Williams and others had good performances, but the film was generally boring and was very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a serial killer that bores people: a helpless guy. Ugly clothes drag their victims around the food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting her medical history until they ask her to shoot them. <br /> <br /> I think the movie appeals mainly to egomaniacs who think that strangers are interested in their photos. I hope that most retail workers want a break from customers.
