Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates to go in real life) and has a weekend with his friends, who are the usual successful types of middle-class whites that appear in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to have fun in Woody Allen's comedies, but here he really falls flat on his face. Even those in a line seem to have abandoned it. It really is not a plot (pieces of bar and pieces of Shakespeare's cod), but Allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air, which makes the thing even more ingenious and half-hearted. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on any level and it's just a giant hole. The best thing about this movie (aside from the closing credits that lie ahead) is that the bad reviews seem to make you wake up and realize that just putting together a slapdash script and choosing your friends is not for fun.
