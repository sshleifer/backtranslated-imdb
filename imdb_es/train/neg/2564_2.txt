When I went to see movies, I would stay awake and watch, or if I did not like it, I would go to sleep, but this was pure shit, I actually got up and left! ... This was misspelled and written Together, I hated it. Besides, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier, he was much better. This was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked George from The Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, the bird, and when it once crashed into a tree. I hope the director of this section pays attention to him, and in the next films he does, he needs to reconsider ... horrible! I would really like to give Ursla a job well done, since it made the movie worthwhile (until I left) ... in general I give this movie a 2 out of 10
