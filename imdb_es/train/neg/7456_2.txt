This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is fun for about 10 minutes. Your high-pitched voice and your crazy agitation begin to age, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a long list of former SNL-ers who have tried movies. Some have been brilliant, others have failed miserably. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then he was fine, and then it was not so much fun, and then he died ... so I guess it affects the whole spectrum in a race. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. <br /> <br /> c
