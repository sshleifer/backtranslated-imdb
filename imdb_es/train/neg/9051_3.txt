I was so excited when I discovered that this was available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's like the rarities CD of your favorite band that you found on the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a big fan, I was sure it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it, it became obvious why these dogs never came to a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "finalists" who must have everything Lynch has done. "Six men get sick" is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. He lacks the power of Lynch's later work, "Grandma" is simply an immature work. It's tedious and it looks like a student movie. But it was the 70's ... It's interesting only if you wait to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of your characteristic images and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is forgettable (No, actually, I can not remember this at all!) "The Amputee" does not make sense. "The cowboy and the Frenchman" is simply stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one worthwhile in the group. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story comparable to his best work. I had to look at this several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. It's hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
