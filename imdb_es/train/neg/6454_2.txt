The Enemy Mine monster somehow made its way to a small mountain community, where it has been established. He is being hunted by a doctor turned vigilante who is willing to exterminate him. This killer, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, travels on a motorcycle and tries to save a group of children who have chosen to have a Big Chill weekend right in the middle of the monster's lawn. Beheadings and a lot of blood are mostly in place to draw attention away from the story that advances as a bad version of Dr. Moreau's Island (and yes, it's worse than Val Kilmer's).
