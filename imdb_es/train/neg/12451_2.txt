This movie is hilarious, not in a good way. The fights are very badly done, while sometimes they will try to surprise you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie. A shooting means that a hero can walk in an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi, pick up a gun, start shooting and not hurt himself. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the boy wakes up, lost his memory, starts to fight because that is what he does well. Five years later the memories return, blablabla comes back. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it, it's not worth the time unless you're drunk and bored.
