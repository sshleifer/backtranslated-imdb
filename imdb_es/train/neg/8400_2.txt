Not even the most fervent puppet fan could like the movie, (I am one of them) the crazies are not given any material to work with. It's also really a shame because this is the only long-running movie that the puppets did with Curly, and this effort from them is painfully inopportune, when it could have had great potential. The horrible musical numbers do not help either. The short film they made with the same title has more laughs.
