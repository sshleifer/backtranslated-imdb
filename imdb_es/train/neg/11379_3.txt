When I first saw a small scene in some ads, I thought the show would be entertaining to watch. The little robot looks pretty cute. The animation style looks somewhat familiar to some classic shows. Before the program was broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There, I did it a little dismayed. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are properly expressed but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much better if he were to be represented by a young man. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is not bad really. But the way Robotboy is portrayed inadequately is my only criticism. That's why I do not see it much.
