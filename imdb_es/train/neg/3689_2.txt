The main aspect about the films of the Superstar in its later stages was the frequency, the gap between one film and the next. Being a well-established star in the movies of South India, the opinions he received before Baba were excellent. <br /> <br /> From Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films that acted in Tamil as a massive hero in 11 years was 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All these were a great success. I was having an image that many thoughts could not easily be taken down. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he went into a state of hibernation. His fans from all over the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch movies of any kind with his superstar in action. Then, the Tamil film industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> Movie creators thought that fans will take everything they show with Superstar. But this clearly did not work in this movie. As usual, the exaggeration of the media and the expectation of the fans went far beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth was totally damaged. The fans went crazy. The collection of the film did not reach the expected level. Reputation of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was the songs of A.R.Rehman. It is known that Rehman has composed good music for some of the worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. Well, I never thought that this movie would join that league. <Br /> <br /> You will feel very depressed, not because the movie was bad, but because the image of the superstar was reduced. It took him five full years to fully recover him with two films, Chandramukhi and Sivaji, and give fans back what they really want in a superstar movie.
