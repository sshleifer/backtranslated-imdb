This movie should not be classified as cinema. Although he is now more than 10 years old, he has never, ever should have obtained funding, and is a plague for the Australian film industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as "The Dish" <br /> <br /> The Actors can not act, music is ... to be forceful, not music, the story is completely non-existent and it is a struggle to sit down. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of your time.
