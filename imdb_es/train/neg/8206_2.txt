You can even predict the dialogue word by word. This is one of those movies that makes you scratch your head and say: "How was this movie made?" In an effort to say something positive, I will add that there are some slightly entertaining special effects. But, in general, if you've seen 5 sci-fi movies, or if you're over 9, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
