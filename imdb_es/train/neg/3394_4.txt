This film features Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a Russian bride by mail, receives Nicole Kidman by mail and receives more than he expected when, by surprise, she is not what she appears to be. The story is quite predictable and Chaplin underestimates too much to the point that it becomes a bit annoying. Kidman is pretty good at this role, so her character is the only interesting thing in this movie. GRADE: C
