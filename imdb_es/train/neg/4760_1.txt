This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic did not last long in theaters. Having recently suffered through cable, I still congratulate myself for not spending money on a ticket. The director Kenneth Branagh, the writer Harold Pinter and the actor / producer Jude Law deceived themselves saying that only his prestige could sustain this parody through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun nor the class of the longest original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine improved his reputation by playing the second advantage in the wonderful movie of 1972. Now he seems determined to destroy it by trying the lead, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, but they lost Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Caine, bloated and shattered, Caine slips through the part with less depth than he shows as Batman's butler. It had already been reduced to a special appearance in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What's next? ALFIE II or SON OF MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? <br /> <br /> But then, nobody benefits from this inane adaptation of Pinter, who thinks that frequent curses and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's ingenious interaction. The direction of Branagh is based on a bluish lighting and a soulless design that would not hold in a second-rate nightclub. Neither shadows nor tight and exaggerated approaches can help Law overcome his boring screen personality. The result is a failure, both as a direct drama and as a detective thriller, which almost makes you forget the purpose behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original theatrical production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine's film would do well to consider this company a bad dream. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 script, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several adaptations of Agatha Christie, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan one or two real murders!
