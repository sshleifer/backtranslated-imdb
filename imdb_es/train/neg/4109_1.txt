It can only be described as horrible. It's bad to start and then it gets even more bad. When you start, you really have to watch it because it is impossible to believe that it could get worse, but do not fear just because. Another badly written script for a donkey director for untalented descendants of past movie stars. It is difficult to decide if the script is worse than the performance or if the direction is worse than both. As for the hero, well, he encourages them all, even to a scene where he overcomes the light of the hard life by opening the closet door and crushing it against the window. And in another scene, they throw him out of a window and they hit 20 feet against the concrete, he does not even blink, then he gets up immediately and gets stuck in the bad guys. This is a really ridiculous movie. Luckily it only cost me $ 1 to hire.
