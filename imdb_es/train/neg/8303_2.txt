Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story," the story told by Jean Shepherd of his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story", however, still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely no charm, and the characters are not even close to the caliber of the original movie. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a mix of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, which include neighbors of Hillbilly and battle tops. Charles Grodin, whom I usually like, is extremely unpleasant in the role of the father (more appropriately handled by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems to be more than forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie, and the little brother is almost forgotten here. Only Mom seems to have something of value here, and maybe that's because she's a movie director with a pot of salsa when he pushes his luck too far with furious housewives in the "night of free dishes". <br /> <br /> The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretch very thin. You can appeal to the extremely undemanding, but as a sequel to "A Christmas Story", it is very poor and not worth it for most people. 2 out of 10
