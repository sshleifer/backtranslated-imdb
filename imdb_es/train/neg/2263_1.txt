Ok, let me tell you that I did not expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked was that it be cinematographic ... and not even that. They looked like someone's bad home movies. "The plot" of the film focuses on a lower class family that decides to move on "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss multiple issues between a mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's girlfriend. From there, the film diffuses and develops into a unique experience: white garbage pornography. Is there redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African Americans and the working class in the United States should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased, however, he did not waste his attempt to reach cinematic stardom.) He was smart, funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> MY DEGREE: F + (daughter was very good)
