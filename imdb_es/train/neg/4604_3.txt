I must give myself a pat on the back for watching this movie until the end because it was really painful. Can an incapable painter become a fully capable murderer? This movie was full of absurdities, of which if I mentioned them all, I would be giving away the movie. Norm Peterson, also known as George Wendt, must really be in a routine to have agreed to make this movie. The performance was deplorable and the story even worse. As a rational and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this movie. There was ineptitude on the part of each main character, there was a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. An absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a film, it only makes a train talkative.
