... this verse does not mistreat the bard so badly. Still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard (whether Ricardo Montalban is or is not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell acts like never before. Most of the dialogue has been done without damage, and the fact that the MST3K version feels obliged to repeatedly point out that the speeches are long * duh * does not seem incredibly comical. However, it is mostly just a bad performance.
