Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour assumes the challenge of making a French musical of the 1930s with vibrant colors. The opening of the voiceover with old and embellished titles was a nice touch. Then, the opening of the camera opens (like the old cranks) on a black and white poster. The camera recedes (or rather, upwards), suddenly shows us the surprisingly bright colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A pretty banal and forgettable song that features an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls who say some nonsense that has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). Those characters come out of the door and are replaced by more people who get into a song even easier to forget. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue at 15 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resna intended to start with a big waste of time and music. cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to throw bolos to the screen and run away. Support. <br /> <br /> It did not improve much. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (since Resnais seems to be too focused on boasting expensive landscapes to worry about real people in front of the camera). People enter and leave the stage like moths around a lamp, and we, the public, can not focus on any particular person or argument. It's as if you were going to take each episode of Brady Bunch and put it in a 2 hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me looking as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was watching the techniques of the camera, the lighting and the landscape, all of them, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? I do not. Maybe tomorrow I will try to see the end. Oh, who am I cheating. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you too. Skip this.
