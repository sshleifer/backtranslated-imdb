What tit at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place student Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker? Ironically, another beautiful future star, Cary Grant, also played a guy from the Salvation Army just two years later in the highly overrated SHE MADE IT INCORRECT. In retrospect, I think it's pretty easy to see the madness of these roles, but I still wonder who thought the Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and that they could see these handsome men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. . A long time ago, I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the United States Volunteers) and I NEVER saw any student who worked there (and that includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So, for the extremely curious, this is a good movie to keep in mind, but for everyone else, it's bad writing, a careless dialogue and annoying morale makes for a very slow movie.
