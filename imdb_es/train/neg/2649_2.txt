My wife and I started watching this movie in advance. It looked warm and touching. It started well; but, soon it became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. It got so bad that we turned it off. The film had a bad performance and honesty, we really could not understand or we wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell could stand this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting crazy, singing and cleaning. I would have committed it. And, of course, as in most movies and television series made in Hollywood, we have to launch a "gay" character! This movie was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
