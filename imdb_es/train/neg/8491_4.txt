Despite some original touches from time to time, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the backdrop for Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film falls short and, ultimately, disappoints. The newcomer, Francesca Faridany, seems talented, but she is wasted like Emmy, a character that in the middle of the film is reduced to nothing more than watching a monitor while Lady Ada narrates an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera persists in its facial expressions, manners, even making it seem translucent or momentarily invisible, representing scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" interpretation of it. <br /> <br /> A direct biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worth it, but this movie, unfortunately, is somewhat of the life of Lady Ada and that of a modern computer scientist (and her doltish boyfriend, of spectrum).
