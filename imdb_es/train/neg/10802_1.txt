Let me give you a brief summary of the film: a rotten and rude boy named Max comes across a radio that contains Kazaam: a rapping genius. Like all geniuses, he grants 3 wishes but, being kind, he also helps Max with his personal life, since he has to deal with thugs and a father mixed with organized crime. During all this, Kazaam raps from time to time, (also shows the sad rap skills of Shaq). <br /> <br /> This movie demonstrates what we all know: athletes should stick to sports. I admit that it never looked like a movie worthy of an Oscar, but EVERYTHING about this movie waste is horrible. The characters are unpleasant or stupid, not even worth mentioning the plot, the dialogue is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would be a joke. I know that the movie only attracted ANYONE because Shaq was so big (he did not mean to play a word game) at that moment. Honestly, I can not think of anything positive to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have spent the time he had used to make this film towards the practice of free throws.
