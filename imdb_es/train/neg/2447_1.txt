After seeing KHAKEE, I felt like I would see another good movie, but unfortunately the movie is a joke and I'm really trying to introduce it to Aryeman. After all, his father, Keshu, is the producer. <br /> <br /> RKS spoke very well about the movie. during the promotions, saying that the movie has meat, unlike the movies released at the time, I wonder what movies I was talking about <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a typical Masala movie with lots of comedy, romance , action, all mixed <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts of all time, Imagine that children kidnap the Dawood family <br /> <br /> The ending is a complete murmur with sudden change of characterization <br /> RKS gives its weakest film to date, except in some Bachchan scenes, the film is boring <br /> <br /> Music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to give her the right role. everything, he does his part well, although he is not the best he can, although he twists his face too much by squeezing a trigger and makes a strange look while smoking the cigar. H the dubbing does not coincide properly sometimes. <br /> < br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and his hams <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems deadpan, he tries too hard but he makes too many efforts some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika emerges the best of the lot <br /> <br /> The rest is fine
