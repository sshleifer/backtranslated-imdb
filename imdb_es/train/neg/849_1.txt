A star. That's all this documentary deserves. I have not felt so disappointed to see a movie, let alone a documentary, in a long time. <br /> <br /> I am a GREAT fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all your joyful fun but informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject remains interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other documents in the series, I thought I also needed to see this, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Good for those of you who posted a good review of this doc ... what were you thinking about? LOL. <br /> <br /> Although the information they were able to obtain was interesting, the presentation failed in all other possible ways. He had a terrible flow, he was incredibly unfocused in what he was trying to say (with disordered information and, sometimes, out of place), horrible effects (including the few moments of CGI and especially the effects of makeup) and the style of MTV used in excess. effects of the camera. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the effects of make-up, a critic here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen run into this giant ape and it looks a lot like a seventies horror movie. . Well, there are many moments like that in which the people who portrayed the monkey men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculously. None of this is helped by the positions and horrible compositions of the camera. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it all is that nothing is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or it seems remotely real. It does not even look like it was taken seriously. Neither lacked any emotional punch that had the predecessors of the series. Do you remember the episode in "Walking With Dinosaurs" about the fate of the Ornithochirus (sp?)? That episode still puts me on the verge of tears every time I see it. It is this kind of commitment to the subject that is missing here above all. When you are more involved in the subject and your own personal history, even one that is only a speculation, you worry more about the facts that surround it. <br /> <br /> The only thanks of this production are pretty good storytelling. (At least in the version of the BBC that I saw) and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT bother renting this, unless you want to laugh (which I did frequently, but usually followed by blank eyes). This does not belong to the shelf with the other "Walking With ..." documents. <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to know that this document was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? Hmmm ...
