A rather incoherent film about a man who belonged and abandoned a superficially hippie religious cult of the 1960s, who fights against them sixteen years later. The man has a son with one of the other cultists, who during a police raid is hidden, and is kidnapped by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some people in the city. It is difficult to keep track of who the characters are, or in what period of time the scenes are supposed to take place. The leader receives probation sixteen years later (I got it from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look older, anyway, as is logical. <br /> <br /> A murder is done with a large circular saw, while others are done with knives or a crossbow. I never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the film, but he is the one who most startles, screaming and shouting. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well connected, with the help of the voice-over (not much) to explain what is happening. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man receives a punch, and we hear the sound of a whip snapping. A woman shoots a gun, and we do not hear her shoot, but we hear a rebound! It does not seem like it was done comically.
