This movie . . . I do not know. I will never know why they took a character as inescapable as Pippi Longstocking and they launched the singularly charming Tami Erin. Why would they spend money on art direction and some special effects that are not so bad, and then they will not bother to edit it correctly, I'll never know. Why sets and costumes are sometimes period and, sometimes, strangely, why they ordered SUCH bad songs, why the script does not make any sense (not even in a level of children's cinema and dumb)? . . . What were you thinking ?? Nothing in this movie is as it should be. Each part is bent (and always wrong), each sound effect is slightly wrong, each edition is in the wrong place, each performance is bad in some way. He manages to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but he NEVER captures the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
