I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and then I felt that it was, in fact, a really horrible movie. But they must have cut a lot of the original movie, or I lost a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I have read several other comments on IMDb.com that mention vulgarity and something about a tampon. I did not see any of that, just a bad and boring movie with unpleasant characters and a trivial and sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills, and almost no expression touches her face. And his name makes me think of sizing a drink in Taco Bell: "I'll have the Big Tail!" It was really fun, it was so bad, I could play like I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, noticing things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for her face. It's really like a silly putty!
