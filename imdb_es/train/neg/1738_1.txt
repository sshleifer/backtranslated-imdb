This miserable movie is a new version of a 1927 movie. They should have let it remain that way. <br /> <br /> What a huge bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. CÃ©sar Romero is subjected to a role of real imbecile and Bette Grable sings with a choir. What shall I do with that Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot is about a photo of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move forward 300 years later, where Grable, newly married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation, when on her wedding night, there is an invasion of Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and runs away before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is forced to stay in the castle when his violin plays Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the whole miserable movie when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news: an enraged Romero annulled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a film was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran support player who is in it, died in 1949; This must have been his last movie. Which pump to leave after such a distinguished race. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel co-stars, but he can not do much with such bad writing. The costumes are more like those that would come out of the stone age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was using.
