I guess this serves to show that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a dollar. The concept of the movie was not very good to begin with. This movie has so many bad things that I do not know where to start. The acting is horrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended in Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing this and I can not believe that 9 people really thought that this "movie" is excellent. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. The final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the movie camera outside Wichita and never let anyone see him again! A rating of 1 out of 10 is much better than it deserves.
