Horrible movie with fragments of the Ramones scattered. Its comedy format worse than the average of the seventies and eighties of great kids who take care of the school with some whimsical plan This movie is terrible The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school willing to fight against his oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and look something like Wild Zero, starring Guitar Wolf, if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible performance, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones that probably needed some quick money, so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think about because this movie explodes.
