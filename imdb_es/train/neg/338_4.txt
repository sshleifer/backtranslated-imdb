Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's minor films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystic boy, three hundred year old dragons and an "Elegido". <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as The opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". Seeker of missing and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is "The Chosen One", and that his destiny is to find and rescue "The Golden Boy". Because if the child died, compassion would die with him, since he is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus pocus crap has not ruined it for you now, surely it will do it once. the movie begins It's enough to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the whole movie. It pretends to be another vehicle for Murphy's brand of selfish humor (comedy is not that great for you), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the proceedings. Very silly and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
