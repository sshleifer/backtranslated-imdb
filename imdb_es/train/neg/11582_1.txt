I'm glad to see that most of the other people here do not think much about this movie either. He has some important names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing more to recommend, except eat a few nice women that you can do in thousands of movies. <br /> <br /> History is nothing more than unpleasant, self-centered characters, who smoke chains and who are "modern" that all national film critics seem to like ... and most of the public can not stand. <br /> <br /> The accents of Oklahoma are so false that they are ridiculous, the racist stereotypes of the south are correct from the liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
