Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love movies, so I have to watch these cruel movies in theaters. And, I expected Vanilla Sky to be good. I expected them to keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or make it their own. Well, it turned out to be a bit of both, and it stunk. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more of that. But in the end we are listening to The Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. Talk about a wide range of sucking in between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple of others, but why, oh, why did GV have to sound during the climax? It was more annoying than confusing or shameless. Especially when you have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Child A = primary. Whatever is. <br /> <br /> He also did a great job with the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise the movie was a big ball of arrogance. As if the audience obtained the movie. Those who would get it would read the subtitles, and the rest would not. It's as simple as that. The motivations were ruined. I did not understand Diaz's motivations (had not they made the chicken soup night before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay on the sidelines. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in this type of movie [ie, Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I get it. Anyway, they tried to improve the original with a soundtrack of American rock and some angles of shit and a good impression of the film and a brilliant prosecution, and it would have helped if Crowe had not ruined it. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Big disappointment.
