Of all the movies I've seen, it's sort of almost in the background (Haunted Mansion, Nothing Only Trouble and some others keep it from reaching the bottom of the rock). It is rushed, the story is unstable and the events shown are badly done. . Of course, we have to put some of this on the writer's door of the book. The book on which the film was shot is scandalously heavy and illogical. Oprah has a nice appearance as the mother of "Bigger", but is not about to reach its potential. Other famous artists also seem to be at their worst. The plot that centers around an African-American who decided to take a job as a driver. By taking the daughter of the family to a communist dinner, she becomes familiar. One thing leads to the other and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against the blacks, but he thinks so. Then, when he gets home, he puts her to bed, but she starts urinating. The blind mother (yes) listens to this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead suffocates her. Now, fearing that he is really in trouble for killing a white girl, he does what any man with logical thinking would do: he pushes her into the coal oven. So the investigators are carrying out the case of a missing person and while they check the furnace (the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of the ashes.) Then they arrest him and the last hour or so are unsavory segments of the courtroom Desperate for a bad movie, this could do the job, but if you really want to learn about cultural issues in the 40s and 50s or see a good drama, there are many better options.
