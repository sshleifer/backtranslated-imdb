There is nothing new here. All the scenes of standard romantic comedy, even the taxi that runs to the airport to stop the woman who flies away. The only thing that saves this is the performance of Alison Eastwood and some of the minor characters (blink and miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had a little fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple is in happiness, and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain of the plot.
