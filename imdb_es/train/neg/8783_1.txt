I do not think I've ever been as impressed by the absurdity of a movie in my entire life as I was when I came out of this shit. NOTHING in that makes sense. None of that is smart or well thought out. for lack of really suspenseful moments, they repeatedly use that trick of total elimination in which you build the music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing aside a curtain and then there is nothing. that's fine to do once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things introduced for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed story lines ... the characters were not well developed at all. The end was ... bad. Bad, bad, bad, everything, every component, of this movie is terrible. And I'm just here to warn you about all that.
