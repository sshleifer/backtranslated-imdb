This film received the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animation Short Film. In recent weeks, I have seen dozens of nominees and winners of this award for the past 30 years and I really believe that this film could be the worst of all, however, it was not just a candidate, but won! I guess 1989 must have been a horrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a group of characters that look a bit like super skinny Uncle Festers. They seem to be simple articulated figures that move using the stop motion animation. All are identical, with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each one has a different number drawn on their backs. All are standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each one has a pole and there is also a box on the platform. The platform begins to lean slightly and, in response, the men move in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for longer. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather unpleasant towards the end, but it is simply not enough to make it fun to observe in the least. Apart from the passable stop motion animation, this short does not offer any interest ... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the great KNICK KNACK shorts also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why. I was not among the nominees. It was a BIG short and it was much better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps the success of Pixar in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and funny that it seems almost to have ignored it. Could Pixar not have entered? This seems unlikely.
