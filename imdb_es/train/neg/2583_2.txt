Another American Pie movie has been pushed through our throats and this is the worst of all. It does not deserve the name of American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like a stupid porn movie in which they put the title of American Pie. When I was watching this, I felt I was watching a different series. It did not fall like American Pie at all. He has a different mood and is much more rude and has many more sex scenes than the other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. Actually I do not recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just keep the beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
