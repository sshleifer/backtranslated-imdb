This movie was a rather strange viewing experience. The film is obviously based on a play. Now I am sure that everything in this movie works well in a play, but in a movie it does not feel interesting enough to see it. The movie is too "staggered" and they did not even bother to change part of the dialog to make it more appropriate for a movie. Instead, what is presented now is an almost literal re-filming of a play, with front-line characters and a prepared dialogue. Due to all this, the story really does not work and the film becomes a boring and obsolete visual experience. <br /> <br /> It's been a while before you discover that this is a comedy. stalking. At first, you think it's a drama that you're watching, with extravagant characters, but as the film progresses, you'll notice that the film is more of a tragicomedy, which leans more towards the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre. . br /> <br /> The characters and dialogue are really the things that make this film a peculiar and exaggerated that sometimes you can not really see. Sure, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but they do not really elevate the film to a level of "visible enough". <br /> <br /> The story feels totally disoriented. Basically, the story is not about anything and focuses mainly on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story about? The film feels like a useless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to see on stage, but like a movie it does not really fit and it just does not work. <br /> <br /> The edition is simply terrible and becomes a reality. Even laughably bad in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> It was expected more from the director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously has made much better films than this, something failed, the play translated to the screen, the project. <br /> <br /> It really is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
