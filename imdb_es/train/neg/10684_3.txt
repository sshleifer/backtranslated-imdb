This movie was craptacular. I was so emotionally involved with each character that the biggest antagonist in the movies was, in fact, myself. I played wonderfully everywhere; Promising myself that I would go, but just taking another beer hoping it would automatically transform into something fascinating along the way. Even in this state, I could not help noticing that Cuba's performance was as weak as tracing paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was unconvincing, as was his bingeing one night after the failure of his own idiot standards. Burt appeared on the screen as a General, that's right, a General (who wears too much makeup). I fell into a terribly fast binge to compete with Cuba, except that mine was real and I touched my toe. Reward! Reward my toe!
