Well, what is it? It seemed to me that Nicholson's character was superficial and, unfortunately, uninteresting. The character of Angelica Huston exhausted my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty whore who is not good. It's not that I "do not understand". It's not that I do not believe that some of the ideas could have led to something else. This is a movie with nothing but the idea that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has in its favor. That Nicholson falls in love with Turner is absurd, but again, he is destined to be like that. However, this does not seem funny, or b.) ... even remotely interesting! This was a waste of my time, so do not let exaggeration get you the best ... it's a waste of your time! With all that is said, the initial sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
