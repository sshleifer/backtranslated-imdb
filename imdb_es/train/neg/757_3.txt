My children see the show every day that is on. It is a great program for younger children. However, they should stop showing reps and do more real shows and get rid of the YELLOW TEETH of Rooney and Deedee. Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white teeth and children notice these things and ask if the 2 do not brush their teeth. Does the program ever arrive in the United States and, if so, where can we find your schedule in? And one more thing if we can add. Moe you have to stop hiding so much. Sometimes, when you come out of nowhere, you scare the little ones and, what happens when you pull the string? What does that mean? apart from getting wet all the time. They need to add new things to their show instead of the same ole the same ole. Children lose interest in that way.
