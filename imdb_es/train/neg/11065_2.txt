This movie had a lot of potential. Anyone who has followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are many details that are overlooked in this movie, it is ridiculous. Too much time and effort was spent on the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the development of the character? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. In which part of the film does he approach his adolescence when he began to kill and maim small animals? Instead, we are giving an incredible variety of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but do not address the main point in the development of Dahmer. In addition, the reason why the country was so intrigued with this story were the details: how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the measures and measures he took to achieve it; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on, but to summarize, too many lagged points in the film, focused on your sexuality and not enough of the blood, the good things you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer".
