He finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting so long .... and unfortunately, it was not worth it! Even for a diehard Lynch fan, I found that this is really tedious ... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, painful pauses where nothing happens, long and monotonous discourses where Nothing is said and everything ends with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell was it, what happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> There was an allusion to Mulholland Drive: the blonde girl and the brunette were very picturesque as Diane and Rita, and a moment of lost Highway with allusions to some important event that happened but you can not talk to clarity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, everything is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it is easy to forget and I think I will remove it from my computer and forget that I saw it. I'm sorry David
