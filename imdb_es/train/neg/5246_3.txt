Wow, the most spooky thing about this episode was the price of the houses 40 years ago. I will start by saying that I am not a fan of the narrated episodes. If the story / actors / etc. They are worthwhile, they should be able to transmit most of the narrative without having to read it aloud, they remind me of the characters that can not think of surprise but depend on teleprompters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it just is not my cup, or tea. They could have kept the narrative, but at least they made it more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or maybe a journalist or something like that. Small things like Peugeot is in the house, which has a unique semicircle path, however, seems to have parked his car in the tree where he was standing, because it can not be seen on the road or on the property. Careless editing, while stopping in the driveway (for what seems to be the hundredth time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30 walking to the car while she stops on the driveway of the deserted house? The close-ups of the car were also exaggerated, such as a Jr. High drama student who discovers the zoom function in his camera for the first time. I could keep separating, but that could be almost as boring as this episode was. He kept moving forward and the real purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the footage that had been filmed of Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I expected to see the Chrysler logo and a good jingle playback while a voice-over told us all about the 8-track player, the automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about this is that it only ends abruptly. There are no loose ends tied, nothing explained or finished. Not that many people noticed, I suspect that most had already changed the channel or had fallen asleep at the end.
