I just bought this movie for a price on National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I got ripped off. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I've seen a movie worse than this one. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film if I did not have such a huge respect for the subject, namely, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yes, many of Foster's songs are intermingled here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern numbers that stink more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, did anyone get PAID to write this nonsense? Second, Foster's true story is fascinating. Why do not you even get close? Third, what did they have in the great Ray Middleton for him to make this movie? Pictures of him with small children? With the communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, friends of Foster, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid ... be very, very afraid.
