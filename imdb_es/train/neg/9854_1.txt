This documentary (or should I say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be, when they have all the enthusiasm in something like that. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. It is unconsciousness, it simply destroys it. However, something positive in this were the visual effects (the dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally false, and that's really disappointing because it came from scientists, so that's the reason why It deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0. An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: it is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to occur in those proportions, so, in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon's stomach. There are many substances with hydrogen in nature, but not those necessary for an animal to fly, and hydrogen does not appear from nowhere, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain how the dragons survive depending on that. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with little chance of conquering planet Earth, but of course at least that explains why they went extinct. Probably the cryptologists call themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them tell lies like in this mockumentary, and what's worse, some people buy them. But I do not think a person who cares about science will create in dragons after seeing this. Those false scientists waste their time.
