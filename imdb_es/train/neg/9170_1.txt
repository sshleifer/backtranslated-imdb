The question, when one sees such a bad movie, is not necessarily "How was such a bad movie made?" or even, "Why did I see this so horrible in the first place?" but, "What have I learned from this experience?" This is what I learned: <br /> <br />: the fact that the "rules" of horror films have been cataloged and lampooned countless times in the last ten years does not mean that someone is not going to make a movie who uses ALL of them, without a hint of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie should be described as ** loosely ** based on the video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character does not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung fu. <br /> <br /> - Although you may be proud to have discovered how to make "the Matrix" effect "on a budget, that does not necessarily mean you should use it again and again ad nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being the brother of Ron Howard does not guarantee roles of choice. <br /> <br /> - When a scene is not edited together, just use some images from the video game, nobody will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap-metal band offers to write the theme of their film for free, politely, decrease it. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not a fight of people killing zombies. zombies that kill people, preferably in the most frightening way possible, that's what makes them SCARY. <br /> <br />: white people who can pay $ 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know, anything else that you will solve in your own two lines after the Ask: "What was that?" or, "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Naked breasts are not a panacea for horror movies. <br /> <br /> - A blow of helicopter boom and a license agreement with Sega magically transform your movie. "student film" to "important studio release". Try it! <br /> <br />: Just because you can nullify the name of the three "Living Dead" movies, that does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I have seen worse movies, but only because I have seen "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
