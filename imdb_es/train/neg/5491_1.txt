We should have been suspicious to discover that, with only two minutes to turn off the lights, we were the only ones there. Only five others joined before the movie began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing at all to redeem this movie. The acting is horrible (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is banal. The effects we have seen a million times. The direction of the film is the worst we've seen. Serpenteante and disunited. Nobody laughed, including children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been earlier if my wife had not gone for a hot-dog! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If there's nothing more to see in your movies, then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch people. You will have a much more pleasant time !!! <br /> <br />
