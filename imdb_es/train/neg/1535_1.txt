I do not think you can make this much worse. Gather the bad actors, the fake tips and three stupid stories, and what do you get? This nonsense B-rate excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the poor quality of the video and the acting is really pathetic, especially when you bring the 25-year-old girl posing as a grandmother with the usually grandmother bun over the ears bitten . Also, the man is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" DO NOT! The werewolf in this was the best of the three that I would say, but still not impressive, since it was all a disguise. The woman's face was later decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you pass, the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this following who are completely late, it's ridiculous. All the "I also want to be a werewolf" "How could you do this to me?" It was silly to say it. You have already asked for it! The werewolf will not even talk about ... it's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third one makes no sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and a boring narrative make up this story and the whole issue of change It still did not make it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who could not hear some parts was stupid. The effects of the animals were rat or pig, which was stupid. Could not they use lion sounds? I guess not, GOOD movies use that. Well, if you enjoy B rates, this is good for you. I got this movie since I'm a werewolf fan and I'll buy ANY werewolf movie and I'll see it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer the good ones, do not waste your money. I beg you!
