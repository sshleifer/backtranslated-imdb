All the films of David Prior are terrible in all aspects: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, without a budget (the brother of the director is usually chosen as the male protagonist). But all have an incredible entertainment value due to their involuntary hilarity. The plot of almost all the "movies" of David Prior (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. The masculine commands of all Americans unite to explode the evil Communists. But unlike other types of Cold War garbage, like Red Dawn, Prior's films are really fun because of their premises and performances. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which General Mitchell is summoning Becker (or is it the other guy?) For a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line of the film is delivered, something like "this is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Have you trained your roommate? And, apparently, this will be your solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems in the video that is used anywhere, BUY IT. They are all fun and even more fun after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to get Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most about all of them is Final Sanction, with the monstrous Robert Z'dar.
