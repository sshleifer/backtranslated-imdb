This movie was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, FÃ©minin and I urge you to watch that movie instead. undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what impresses me the most is the endless stream of nonsense. Lena Nyman has to be the most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this movie, ... she's not attractive. In comparison with Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that it is clear from the difference in ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A film of its time and place. 2/10.
