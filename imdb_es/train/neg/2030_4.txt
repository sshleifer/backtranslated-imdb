The comment of "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail in the head" for this turkey of a program. But it's nice to see William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the "marks" in the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This program would be a great play on SNL or MAD TV, and rate some stars for a visit, or something like that, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" to new heights, either on paper or as the same. . But the boy is fun. <br /> <br /> The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the data rolls of the game, will be quite unfortunate when this turkey is canceled, unless there is a rebirth of Whiskey-a-go-go, with a resurrected demand of well-trained young women to dance in raised cages once more. <br /> <br /> I observed the first participant, who was annoying, and literally "more foolish than a: publish," however, by sheer luck, he left with a quarter of a mile or less. The second participant, somewhat smarter, but who would be lucky to win $ 1,000 in Jeopardy, was stunned by the card that requires answering a special question, which he did not know, and therefore went away with zero. <br /> <br /> This plethora of gaming programs, which hang, and sometimes give large sums to individuals every day, is a cheap effort, in general, to try to attract viewers. Even if the host is well compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the incomes in comparison with the costs can be favorable, since there is no comedy of situation in which several stars obtain six or seven figures. per episode, with some great residual offers as well. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best ones will wear out in no time. This has already reached this point. I think your offers, especially with James Spader, and the others in "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfactory amount of Bill Shatner's offers. <br /> <br /> Once again, the above qualification is simply appropriate to see Bill hoot and Prance, maybe once; That should be enough.
