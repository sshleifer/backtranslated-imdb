['Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past who seems pretty forgettable. I never thought your show was so great. This is his one-dimensional characterization of a criminal boss, with very predictable results. If you take the car chases and the general ride, there is not much plot of development or action. Mafia movies seem boring to me because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, Italian cinema, treats these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I will not remember much about it. Many shots, innocent bystanders dying, betrayal and that sick loyalty. The film is very well photographed and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (due to the voices that just could not get out of those bodies), that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.']
