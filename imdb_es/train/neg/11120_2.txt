You know that a movie is bad when the highlight is being able to watch a brief moment of "Jeopardy!". <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men's Can not Jump is that it had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in an area like the one shown in this movie; The racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre performance and the bad script in White Men Can not Job left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The film's sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money playing a basketball game. Then he returns home and relaxes with his girlfriend; And the process repeats itself. Most stories come to a climax of some kind, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this replay (this case is "Billy wins or loses money when playing a basketball game"). <br /> <br /> For a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the movie is also going to be interesting. Apparently, the writers of White Men Can not Jump forgot this rule, since the plot can be summarized as "Billy needs to pay the bills". I appreciated the change of pace of other formula sports movies, but, I'm sorry, this was just horrible. I would have cared less if Billy had the money to pay the rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a successful movie. Apparently, some sports fans will reject the terrible writing of some scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were attracted to the big names that play the leading roles. This makes me wonder if the cast was replaced completely by previously unknown actors and if the basketball theme was replaced by the lacrosse, would anyone have bothered to watch this movie? Really I do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this film two out of ten stars; The extra star is for the "Jeopardy!" Scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
