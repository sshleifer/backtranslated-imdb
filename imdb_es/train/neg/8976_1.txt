The first point that draws attention in "For Ever Mozart" is the absence of a summary of the plot in IMDb. The explanation is simple since there is no story, script, argument or whatever you remember the minimum structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors in the film industry and this pointless shit is among his most hermetic films. I think neither of you has understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who elucidate to justify or explain this messy movie, and it is fun to read their criticisms. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "For Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
