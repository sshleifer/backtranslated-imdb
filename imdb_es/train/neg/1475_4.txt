Most episodes of season 1 are horrible ... There's no comparison with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, since the shows actually had decent stories. Most amazing Stories are pretty boring ... not unbelievable in the least ... buy or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard that season 2 of this series is much better ... also, for some reason, in the DVDs that cut The parts of Ray Walston that further diminish this compilation. The good thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... However, most of the story lines are very predictable and the series could have been better with twists and turns that left you thinking ...
