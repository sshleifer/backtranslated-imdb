This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but stinks. First, what the hell are those punk trying to do with school? I think children do not seem to realize the seriousness of the situation. Deker's boy tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when she asks him why he wants to go back for them, but right after that he gives a gun to the guy in a wheelchair and he wants me to just repair the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors must pay for their food, but why not just give them the money it takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity? Oh yes, and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid punk guy does not shoot in the cafeteria anywhere like crazy. Everyone wants to look professional, but everyone stinks. One more thing, I do not think there is not an emergency exit at school, the children are testing several doors but they are all closed. What happens if there is a fire and the dumass security guard is dead? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit at school. Anyway there is much more to say but it would be too long. I spent a time of my life to see shit.
