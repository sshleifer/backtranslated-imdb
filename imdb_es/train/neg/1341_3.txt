After the success of the (horrible) movie reruns of Gilligan's Island TV, several films were recorded for television in the eighties reunited of classic programs. Most of these movies completely missed the boat until it regained the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it is a comedy style Laurel and Hardy that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful and essential comedian for the series, is completely wasted: she has less time here in this 90-minute film than in a single 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing more than cameos, what was the goal of making them younger and rethinking them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the spooky relatives of Munsters was a nice touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as the mad scientist, mainly because there is too much of him and not enough of the underutilized Munsters (ironically that same year, 1981, the old companion of Caesar In the comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately chosen in an important part of a television movie meeting RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange and inexplicable part at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures in a local horror wax museum. Why would they be there when they are supposed to be a "typical" (though odd) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last project of Munsters with the original cast in their roles, there was a terrible resurgence of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a television movie of the 1990s in which they were introduced to DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick.
