I am afraid that this is quite frightening, despite several good performances and a direction of action for the camera generally competent. It is a first and last attempt of the writer and director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate byproducts of Canada's program to promote home cinema. While the program encourages valuable efforts such as "New Waterford Girl", it opens the door to novice talent like Lyu, who did not have to aggressively launch this project, but received a green light without an adequate examination of his script or his credentials. <br /> <br /> He does not mind the low budget because the production design in poor condition, poor lighting, poor audio and the selection of docu style shots is consistent with the theme; The workers of the Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the conspiracy do not give the actors anything to work with, the editor a lot to put together, or the viewer any mental challenge other than the suspension of disbelief. When his story is so simplistic, the last thing he needs is a confusing narrative technique; Although nothing happens, the film is difficult to follow and the point of view is impossible to specify. <br /> <br /> The performance of Don McKellar as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky hollow head; As always it is nice but here is little more. Cindy by Kira Clavell is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Betty, from Tara Spencer-Nairn Street, more than cancels her excellent performance in "New Waterford Girl". His superficial performance in "Rub and Tug" should reduce any tendency to look for other films in which he has appeared; unless you need additional confirmation of the ability of "Waterford" director Alan Moyle to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain can not understand concepts such as the complexity of the plot, so the need to insert a lazy and lame deus ex machina device towards the end is not a surprise. Still it could be worse, the apathetic story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a boy
