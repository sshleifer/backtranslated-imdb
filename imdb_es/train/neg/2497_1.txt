There is only one problem with this website, you can not give a negative rating. Also, a classmate rated this as a grade D movie. I say I was being too kind. A piece of wood could show more emotion than the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this film would have been better used to start a fire. This is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life so that anyone who suffers this bloodbath without talent will never return. After watching 5 minutes, the boys and I wondered if sinking bulk weights would make this more entertaining. Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later, I finally found that part of this grade G acted remotely and fun. It is an insult to this entire planet that the director thought that someone could find something more beneficial about this, that he should go buy a rope. And to the actors in this film, I hope they have paid well for being in this joke because I doubt they will return to work. In summary, I awarded everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points for their acting license.
