This movie is totally garbage. Some intellectual imbecile consoles himself by doing everything possible to claim the superiority of the aristocrats over the working class. Nothing more than a bit of catharsis of complacency. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this type of film is developed in the USA. UU., It will surely become a great joke. And simply because it comes from the "other side", it becomes a masterpiece, a wonderful fun for certain westerns with brainwashing and / or brainwashing (some of George W. maybe :). A typical sequel to the Cold War, a kind of joke anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this, as expressed in this film, is all that the Soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all these years, then perhaps they deserve all the miseries they claim to have passed. BUT NO! Because like many others, I have read and seen real masterpieces made by outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something that is also relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ear", both the book by Gavriil Troyepolsky and the film by Stanislav Rostotsky, is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sadness, real pride and dignity, one of the best true of the Soviet era.
