I think the Croc Hunter is a great guy! I know I would not have the courage to walk away even 5 feet away from a crocodile. <br /> <br /> But, everything in this movie is bad. The joke jokes, the people who eat them and the president's sketch make the film one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> It's a really bad movie that you have to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so small that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the writer is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Croc Hunter did not ask the crocodile to eat it after seeing this.
