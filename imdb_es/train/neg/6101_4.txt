Almost a work of two people, and as such, the dialogue and actions of potential customers will be important. They are not particularly good either. This could have been stronger, in fact, if it had first been created as a work for two people and then worked on in a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a nervous vampire who seems a bit autistic became infatuated with a stripper (as a result of watching too much pornography in his fucking house). He wants her to tell him about the light of day. It would have been better to find someone with a day job, or someone who excels in painting a picture with words like a poet, but they may not have a sexy body. <br /> <br /> After he helps her. Do what you want (and is not terribly good at that), intends to feed on it at 6 AM, when the sun rises. He has done much of that term, although he also says that he can go without food, he will only feel more hungry. In addition, he states that he can not let the stripper go, since she knows about him, but lets other people go who learn what he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly covered that the light of the streetlights and neighboring buildings is poured as if it were day, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, one would think that he would have done a better job or that he would have fixed the place a little. Clearly he is not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although, that was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
