This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I am studying French at the university and, therefore, I understood the whole dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is very difficult to empathize with any of the characters that are shown in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I guess there are no professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I rated it in 1 out of 10 it probably does not deserve such a low rating. This is simply a futile effort to reduce your current overall rating from 7.3 to something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the movie has a real duration of approximately 100 minutes that it will never recover again. <br /> <br /> The real pity is that I'm sure some college student is breaking his nut by making a film twice as good and half as long. However, if you want to join the car that seems to be shooting at IMDb, you can also give a "10 in Lost in Translation".
