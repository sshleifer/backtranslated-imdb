VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a big disappointment. And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the script, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a film written with a lead script drily directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik. First, the top of Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one-note performance lacks the fire and enthusiasm that Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat disguised as a Mexican bandit who finds himself in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, the second billed Robert Mitchum is totally lost in the image! His role as a biplane that flies from the air to throw home-made bombs at the cause of the revolution is a poorly written, poor paper that any minor star could have played. Mitch does not have a decent line in the whole movie and recalls his other image of the Mexican Revolution, the very superior "Bandido" (1956), which unfortunately no one seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD. In addition to lacking any kind of style, "Villa Rides" also suffers a lot without the presence of a female star. There is a Grazia Buccella star as a young Mexican who gives Mitchum a cheerful eye, but her casting is merely superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have added a couple of very necessary notches to the halting plot of the story. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie, but a couple of good action scenes do. it's not a movie and Panavision's image quality, less than perfect, plus the repetitive melody of Maurice Jarre's theme does not help. <br /> <br /> As it is from Paramount, there are no extras, not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing movie and a DVD presentation that could have been and should have been much better.
