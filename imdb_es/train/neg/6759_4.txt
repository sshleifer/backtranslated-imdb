Another case of a decent DVD case that betrays the quality of video footage of the film. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rochon does a useful job and Damn it! the cast is handsome I've never seen many muscular men meet regularly. This movie really wanted to make you think that Rochon was the killer, but it was not like that. My biggest problem with the movie was that, in the end, I did not care much who the killer was, and the real killer did not make much sense, since it was out of place and the filmmakers thought "ha, betcha no". Look, one comes, fool! ' Yes, there were continuity errors (mainly with Mrs. Rochon's ever changing wardrobe), but for an indie it's not that bad. At first, I was pretty sure it was just a little disguised excuse for the girls to go topless, but that was just a trick. The dialogue was overly thoughtful and painful at times. <br /> <br /> I just do not have many expectations about it, and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully underestimated.
