I must say that during my childhood I am very proud of many of the films that I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the scammers movie of all time in the curriculum of any actor. Can you imagine what the fired Whoopie agent should have told him to sign this shit? "Hey, Whoop, have you ever seen that Dinosaur show, yes, they're making a movie and you can see Germany!" After that, that agent must have referred a lot to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad that I thought that Whoopie should have bought all the copies of this movie and destroyed it. I just wish she could have done the same in my memory, because my sister still gives me for having seen that movie. I mean, come on, I'll even admit that I saw Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in the movies (good reasons why I gave up both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), however, this seems like the worst of my life . The childhood, and the biggest rent of my life, and that was 16 years ago. Now I am 24 years old, if you want to do the mathematical calculations. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think of my list of the worst movies of all time, I do not even mention this, because, like a raped stepdaughter, I try to repress what happened. Fucking Whoopie, it just makes people happy to recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst lucky.
