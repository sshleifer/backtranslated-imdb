I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen the SNL sketch, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it could not have been so bad, right? The answer: it was. This movie was not a means to relax after a hard day's work. I kept waiting for a plot and a fun part, but there was none. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson, and that's it.
