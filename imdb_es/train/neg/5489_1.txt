The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial race around the earth and tries to return home. As long as he remains on our planet, he will create friendly bonds with humans. <br /> <br /> But, unlike the ET that emanates drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. In fact, it is a pure Dysney production: its main audience is children and the film is more visual in the message than in the message. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the city). , a "cosmic" lost toaster) and the release is experienced, with special mentions to "Doc", who rejuvenates in a character of "Mac Fly", and Hurley, who seems open to automatic mockery. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: the main title is scored by Danny Elfman, and like any other great composer, you recognize his "voice" even before he is credited.
