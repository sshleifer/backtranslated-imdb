Let's put it this way. Actually I get this movie. I understand what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue was meant to be dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot was not supposed to be climatic and it was old. That was what the writer / director was looking for. A very, very, very dry humor / comedy. With all that understanding, I still think that the movie stunk. It seemed that the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It had all the same characteristics. Even the main character behaved similarly to Napoleon. But Napolean dynamite was actually fun. Your script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose Well, let me rephrase that. Its sole purpose is to swindle Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that aspect. Too bad it did not work.
