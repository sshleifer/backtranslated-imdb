I LOVE Don Knotts, let me say that in advance. He is a huge talent and the best at what he does, which is to portray a nervous loser, with a lazy amazement, thrown into a position of authority. He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the Reluctant Astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, actually, even though when we were kids my brother and I were delighted to see this and his other movies. It's still worth watching, but it's really a movie that kids enjoy better. I would categorize it as 100% family friendly and something to sit and watch your children on a family night. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts movies, there is a great cast of beloved characters The actors and you can not help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaking and open-mouthed looks, no matter how old and tired he is. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think it is The good thing about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s: all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how smooth and elegant Leslie Neilsen was back then. The only complaint about the story is the love interest of Roy, an unpleasant and nasty woman who can not give him the time of day until he becomes a great shooter. If you're like me, you'll expect him to give him the push at the end. Be careful, you will whistle the melody of the theme for days after seeing it, it's that catchy.
