Salvage is the worst horror movie I've seen in my life. There is nothing remotely horrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a fine genre. First of all, I do not see how many people can think that this piece of shit is a great movie. If I wrote something as boring and absolutely ridiculous as this one, I would laugh and be too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Second: the acting is terrible and the main actress is unbearably ugly. Third: history sucks, it has been used before, and the excuse that it is a cheap movie is not an excuse. Read the summary in the back of the case, which reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to lose in something that will make you regret having seen it. I feel very bad for those thieves and the irony of his name.
