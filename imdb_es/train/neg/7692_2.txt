Here are a couple of previous comments that comment on the abundance of clich√©s in this film, and I completely agree, both with respect to the characters and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I read about the horrible movie of Elizabeth Berkly performing in the equally horrible "Showgirls", which I have never seen, and her performance here, although it is not horrible, barely reaches the standards of the worst rate of Lifetime. There was not a hint of depth in his character, but then probably he should not have done it. If so, I would have put the film completely out of balance, since there was not a hint of depth or charisma, no trace, in any character, actor or performance. <br /> <br /> The handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was ridiculous. The initial reaction and her husband's advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in her car gave her a more realistic and intelligent action and, hell, they challenged him mentally). (excuse the redundancy) the father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and completely annoying at the same time, it is not a feat. His lawyer was more an insensitive nerd, who was not unknown in the profession either. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I enjoyed this part), the police were a collection of insensitive friends, which rather relies on Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all the law enforcement and research in their community. I know that most of the real cops are a little short of sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level shown by most of the characters in the series "Law and Order", and things like that, but the dollars of This level seems to be a serious one in "Lifetime". <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of "story within a story" fascination with Josh's invocation that he was the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted presentation within the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. This was something like an achievement, like moving from "F" to "F-less". <br /> <br /> This unconvincing situation should have been solved, in real life, in about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting. Between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have prevented the drama from being followed, and would have left an empty hour in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here, demonstrated with their end, that they could do even worse. When the situation was finally "solved" and "corrected," this was achieved in about 45 seconds, with no indication of what steps might have arisen in any "real world" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or if there could be could find some kind of path to redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it has a slight "fascination".
