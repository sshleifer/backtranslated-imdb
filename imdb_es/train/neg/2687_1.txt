Eleven "great" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of pure tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-satisfaction. Traffic for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt giving a "devil to the hip!" For the terorism in its amateur segment. On the other side of the green line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel, who uses his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focuses on a news anchor. Alejandro González Iñárritu from Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to turn on the camera. Sean Penn did not know there were no buildings in the shadow of the Commerce Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial love story and cliché. Ken Loach from the United Kingdom focused on Chile. Etcetera etcetera.
