['I expected a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes and many that just did not work. I did not like the idea of bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would have been more fun if only they had had someone new, instead of resurrecting Moriarty. Some of the things were fun. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The 5-0 McGarrett of Hawaii was not even like McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but she played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not presented much in the script. I expected a more fun movie. Instead, I have a pretty confusing movie with a poor script. More ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together in this. Maybe they were about to break into 77.']
