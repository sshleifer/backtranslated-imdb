I was lying in my bed, with a very bad cold or flu or whatever. I imagine that maybe I would like to waste my time watching some horror movies that my mother bought me a while ago. I wish I had never chosen this movie! After seeing it I felt even sicker and wanted to vomit. Afterwords (when I got better, of course) I did an investigation about Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie did not look anything like the real one. I hope no one will see this movie, but if they ever do not eat or you will feel like I felt after having seen it for the first time. I think you'll have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better reviews on this site.
