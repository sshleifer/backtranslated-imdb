I thought they should have called this movie "White" instead of "Alturas". Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed with themselves and think that their lives are so important ... give me a break. Such a cast of white lilies that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in him, this movie was asking someone real to come in and steal it ... and so they present, they get this, a character even more white than the rest of the world. Cast (I thought he was an albino at first) who is supposed to be Welsh. I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of movie that can fool so many people into thinking it's worth it because it has the characteristics of something more ambitious. Better fill the theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious shit ... it must have been a better work because you can not fall off the floor.
