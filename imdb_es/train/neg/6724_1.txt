When you choose a movie, I hope one factor you consider is whether the actors in the film use their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way. This is not a political statement. This is a moral problem that the effects are society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist comments about a teenager and his father, we must ask ourselves (do I want to support that behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's behavior tear the social fabric that teaches our young people to correct evil, good behavior of evil that loving kindness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx must remember that it's just entertainment and that there's a lot of that so we can choose. Saying sorry does not get him out of trouble. It will not harm or eliminate the bad behavior that it transmits to our young people. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. You can not see anything of which they are a part anymore. We can not change them, but we can stop the fame we give them.
