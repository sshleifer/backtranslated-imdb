There's only one thing I should say about this movie: the scene in which Shaq is in a musical number with the character of Francis Capra for wanting to be a genius; Never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting is terrible (come on, it's Shaq!) And I prefer to see Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before watching this movie.
