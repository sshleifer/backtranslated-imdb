This is a great story and it was only the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it, too). However, even though this is true, it is still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize that independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) with an absolutely atrocious performance. Okay, the script was terribly clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anyone because it is poorly done in all categories. Read some books about the real history of the United States Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
