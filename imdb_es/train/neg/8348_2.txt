I just finished watching "The Other". I've always taken off my hat at the performances of Julio Ch√°vez, since he's a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I suppose it would have been worse if it was not for Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. ... it's really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense either. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is to bore and impress the audience with scenes that surprise you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. In general, I definitely did not like this movie.
