I was attracted to see this movie because of this argument and my desire to see horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, this became more of a comedy than a horror. The acting, the dialogue and the flow of the film were very badly done. A lot of that did not make sense. For example, there is a group of about 30 people and they are all terrified of a person even though they are in a secret place and they are healthy looking young adults and the guy who threatens them looks a bit haggard. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look horrible, emphasis on trying. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood are also badly made. I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this. A guy with a clean cut head ... he looked clean: he was missing signs of bones, flesh, blood and even his head. A sharp blow down with an ax on a corpse should fit into something ... it looked like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who was supposed to be the main villain was a turn, but contradicted other parts of the story. What was going on in the boy's mind to get out like this? If there was going to be a turn, you should at least build it by adding mystery and suspense.
