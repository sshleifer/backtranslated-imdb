This image reminds me of an image of Keneth More from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton, "while on the ship he was a servant and on the island he became the master and, being saved, he was again a servant. well in some movies, it does not shoot, if there is any image that shows that Madonna can not act, it is this one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it's a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but I think I like it and if that is the case, then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is regrettable, providing a platform for the actors to improve their career profile and, simply, that fails in every corner and detail. br /> <br /> The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre, the script should have been put through the shredder before placing it, although many here have canned Madoona for all their performance, I think in movies like "A league of its own" was quite good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" showed a rarity in Madonna's style that does not show up later or later. Other Madonna movies are not so nice and I would have liked to see a series of Madonna Animation with the character of "Who's That Girl". I like the music of these two films, however, "Swept away" remains at the end of the pile here and it will remain that way. <br /> <br /> everyone has a bomb, right?
