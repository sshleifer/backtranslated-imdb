A worn-out plot of a man who takes rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of a stranger inside who is finally excluded. <br /> <br /> With such an outstanding case, one might think that the film would rise above its hackneyed origins. But the drones scene after scene have no change in intensity, there are no arcs of characters or unexplained behavior. <br /> <br /> The issue of homosexuality was completely unnecessary or, on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seemed to be included just to excite the viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling image? <br /> <br /> An unfortunately terrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected something better from her and from Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely one to lose.
