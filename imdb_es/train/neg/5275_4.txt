The disappearance is about a couple who takes their family on vacation in New Mexico and is in serious trouble after turning off the main road to visit a city that apparently was abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. The city of Weaver seems harmless at first and has a tourist attraction until the family is stranded there during the night and begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced the same situation with fatal results. The Henleys see a video diary of Blair-Witch-Project-esquire left by the city's latest victim, which ironically shows the best performance of anyone in this movie. Although the performances of Hamlin and Dey are much better than those of the supporting actors, their emotional effect seems "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Disappearance has an appeal for most of the film as there is a lot of suspense and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and improbable turns that apparently do not make sense. Worse yet, there really is no understanding of exactly what is happening in the film, which makes the final stranger less tolerable. It seemed to me that the filmmakers were so focused on making a series of suspense scenes that they discarded all the elements of the good story: plot development, gradual explanation of the themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the film for me was that three-quarters of the film was spent creating tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly dismissed as if we did not. Deserves an explanation: <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to Weaver's original people? What was the connection with the people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing child discover in any case? <br /> <br /> This was, I think, a bad move, since it generated some resentment. He had invested a little mental capacity in formulating hypotheses of some plausible explanations for some of these plot twists and strange events, only to have the filmmakers simply finish it without giving an answer to any of these things. These are some good fangs for the end of a miniseries that is about to be picked up next week, but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending to an independent film.
