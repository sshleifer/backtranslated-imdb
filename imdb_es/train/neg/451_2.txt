I do not care how many nominations this garbage got for better this and that, this movie stunk. I did not know whether to turn off the television or file a lawsuit with O.J. for illegal damage to my mental health. I have rarely been so bored; Calling this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of all the viewers of the entire planet. The whole story was stupid, the performance was not inspired, the "drama" was emotionless. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unsatisfactory experience.
