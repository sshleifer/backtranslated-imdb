I still have not been able to see all this; It is running on the cable at this time, and it seems that I keep coming in the middle of it. My main reason to be interested is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; He is a pretty good actor, and has done a good job throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that, although I'm never really a fan of the previous series, I liked the Thunderbirds for the Boats and effect of work. Derek Meddings was possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the international rescue ship are wonderful. The current team has done a good job of translating their work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a boring story. Children are asked to drive, and while they do a good job, it is difficult to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' eight-year-old son flying T2, a huge transport of several tons with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you see a Ford logo. The placement of the product is way above here, and it is annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do a lot with a one-dimensional paper. If you can accept the film for its very limited merits, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable trip. Just do not look too closely at the machinery that drives it. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I finally saw all this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is quite poor, and while the effects are quite good, the story in multiple presentations has become more difficult. The exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying, and children, as central characters, calm down on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is bearable. But not very. Look at the original program and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a tip for Jon Frakes. Take an update course in the Directors Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. In telemundo Nicknamed in Spanish, with corny comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in about the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible that a film that was already scarce was worse, but it was. It was shamefully bad. <br /> <br /> If this had been done directly, no joke jokes, no jokes, it might have worked. As it is, it is just another beloved joy of childhood that has been ruined.
