Now, I have not read the original story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to follow that path here. <br /> <br /> But a while ago I learned that Stephen King's films are simply not horror movies, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the performance, although Fred Gwynne was, as always, wonderful. I will also forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story move forward. ... <br /> <br /> But there was a consistent point with which I could not help but get angry. And that was pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters participated in the activity of silly stupidity. The moments that I mean are like this: There is a little zombie running around the house. You suspect that it is under the bed. (<br /> <br />) (a) get as close as possible to the bed before blindly lifting the duvet cover, exposing practically your whole body to any damage that an undead cannibal like that may cause, or <br /> <br /> (b) step away from the bed so you can look under the fully open end from a slightly higher safety position, or at least see the mini terror approaching you, giving you a little time of reaction. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I want to offer myself for the massacre today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Pretty funny movie, though ... It just does not give much fear.
