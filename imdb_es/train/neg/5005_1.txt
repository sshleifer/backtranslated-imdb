A cheesy Grade C movie, convincingly horrible (and NOT in a funny way). Everything screams 'amateur', from the disheveled script (strange premises, limited coherence and predictable endings, the turgid lighting, the sound and dark angles of the handheld camera, the undeniable and timid sexual references and passe; incredible to Z I saw it on DVD and I kept waiting for Edward Wood to come out, everything is forgiven, your Worst Movies are works of art, and more coherent than this combination. <br /> <br /> But still, it's preferable to the "Every night in my dreams I listen to you", are you sure that the Titanic team was not involved in this on its side?
