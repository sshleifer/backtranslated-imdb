Why were so many people gathering at an evening of Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" at the San Francisco Film Festival? "This is a hit man," said my friend. "Well ... and he's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful and multicolored people, tropical climate, lush rhythms and a gangster fashion plot? There is no doubt that there are many temptations. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us a small detail: this is a very bad movie, quite horrible and so unpleasant to see since it is badly made. <br /> <br /> So how the hell did "Against All" the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous smaller local festivals and now San Francisco? Apparently, due to the way the promotion process works and the film festival circuit. <br /> <br /> First, he won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was named the best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year; They have had much, much better. Next, the agile synopses in the catalogs plus the imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and, since the film does not appear anywhere and therefore avoids the scrutiny of the critics, it continues in the rounds. In the promotion sometimes we earn a lot. A festival in Chicago called "Contra Todos", a speedball cocktail that was taken out of Brazil "and referred to Claudia's boyfriend as the" slum neighborhood stallion. "Soninha is" the daughter of Teodoro, an old nymph similar to a nymph and with an increasing sexuality. "The film is" filmed with the urgency of a handheld camera frequently "and the director" creates a genuine and palpable feeling of frustration caused by domestic despair and disintegration. " The effect is "unbearably crude and honest," and the film rushes "to a conclusion as dead-end as the lives on display." It's not the best writing, but it sure increases the excitement for a certain type of potential viewer. /> <br /> "Against All" concerns a hit man, two hit men in reality, and a wife and a wife, and a born-again Christian girlfriend, filmed, in an extremely ugly digital video with no talent behind the work of camera, mainly in a poor neighborhood with a desolate aspect, instead of one of the "favelas" full of people or poor neighborhoods of Brazilian cities, where such wonderful films as "Black Orpheus", "Pixote" and "City of God" were made , and not this time in Rio, but in São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The man with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a small television experience, as does the actress who plays the blonde slut of Teodoro, Cláudia (Leona Cavalli), and Silvia Lorenço, who plays her daughter Soninha, with a pout and ready for the revolt. These actors can reach the back corners of a few telenovelas. Who knows? - In a better directed film they could even be good. Apart from them, there are some young people who are beaten by Teordoro or, when busy, gangs of thugs. The directors do not have much presence, even though the camera magnifies their pores. <br /> <br /> A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one at the London Festival, saw the flaws of this film, but sadly 're buried inside the web. Henry Sheehan pointed out from Berlin that the "movie" (his quotes) was "the worst of the video works" shown. "The filmmaker seems to have chosen the video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film," Sheehan wrote, "and he has not made any creative use of the new medium," nor does he add that he has done anything more creative. <Br /> <br /> Sheehan pointed out the film's first big mistake: "It starts as a domestic drama that is supposed to increase when, half an hour after the action, Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are a professional success "Men. The wait of thirty minutes does not add anything to the film, it seems a perfectly arbitrary decision and it is, at least, a waste of time. But the speed increase is all that Moreira does, like a child who has a toolkit. for his birthday, and he's hitting everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill. "Devastating, but true. <br /> <br /> When writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to see the positive side, but nevertheless, left aside the lack of features to redeem the way in which the performances are "easy" as those of the film. Yes, very easily, since everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that "this low-budget, violent and sordid account of those without laws in Sao Paulo lacks pleasant characters and, as a result, of hope." Too dark and cynical to be a revealing account of the human condition, the film It is not helped by poor subtitling ... "Alsanjak connected Contra Todos with" Dogme "and Mike Leigh did not help at all. <br /> <br /> Apart from that first half hour without meaning, in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence, that when they arrive, they are simply "hitting everything that is seen without rhyme, reason or skill ": Moreira tries awkwardly to redeem his abrupt ending by adding what seems to be something after him, followed by an unusual ironic scene where one of the characters marry Without a doubt, the director wanted to show the" banality of evil " of low-level assassins in the neighborhoods of the working class, but can not make the characters, which he sees generically, come alive for us. And the structure of the film shows that he can not edit his material either. <br /> <br /> (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)
