The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients. Almost at the same time, he decides to model his murder after the Zodiac killer of the 60s. He gets in touch with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a weapon (apparently the only weapon, since it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, but it is not described as the same weapon) and goes out to kill. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like movies B. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting really drowned the plot. I thought that the "blood" was too false, the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialogue was too standard. The film was filmed on video, which is fine, but the editing of the film has just been done for some strange scenes of 'Plan 9'. It is not a bad movie for the fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a little more polish, it happens to something else.
