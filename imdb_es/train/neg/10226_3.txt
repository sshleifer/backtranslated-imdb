"Do not bother watching this movie" would be better advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a big disappointment considering the great cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was nothing, certainly nothing like what is described in the VHS chart, of course. There was simply no suspense, little emotion and too many boring points, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messy. This was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not need to see this character to know that she could act. "Some Like It Hot" was just enough evidence for me. But this role simply did not suit her and it's not surprising that it was not one of her most popular films. <br /> <br /> It's also a shame that a movie has squandered the talent of actors like Richard Widmark. Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: it is not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
