That's pretty ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the USA. U.S., The USA UU And all over the world. Religion has more than one billion followers. I myself was born and grew up in America and, through my classes and religious teachings, they taught me to appreciate my country and work to contribute to society. I am very dedicated to the following and the teachings of my religion have been emphasized throughout my life to educate myself and prepare for success through education to be able to contribute again to the world. I know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I still have not met a person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion, except the people in the media ... I wonder. why ... It's also sad that these extremists are the ones who use the media to represent an entire religion. It is a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent. I am sure that other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK, the IRA and many more, who are simple extremists of small percentages who use outdated information and not literal passages from respected books to pursue their own revenge. , personal or business matters through your religion call
