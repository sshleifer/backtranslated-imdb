Believe it or not, this movie is worse than number three. It is slower, the performance is worse and the story is very weak. There is not much to say about this movie. Even the fight scenes are more boring than number three, and it would have seemed impossible to me. They are 90 very slow minutes. In fact, I've tried. I hope it gets better. If you really want to see this movie, you should try to find a cheap rental it.it is hard to find (to buy, that's it) and probably for a good reason. As in number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. It's the same name alone. Anyway, the most I can give the best of the best: No warning is 2/10
