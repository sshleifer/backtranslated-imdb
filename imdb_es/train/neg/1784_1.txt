OK, I recorded this on TV and I missed the beginning. The movie took about 10 seconds in the titles (I guess), so if something happened before I lost it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in this, I did not see it. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and, obviously, Stephen King, who acted in a really horrible way as an assistant to the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks charming, apart from the scenes in which she has the face of a cat or is in full fantasy. -up. <br /> <br /> Even with the initial titles, it is never very clear exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the sequence of the title, I assume that they are feline bipeds that live extracting life force from humans. I guess they live a long time and these 2 in particular are possibly the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add to this a very large dose of incest (yes, I also thought it was a bit suspicious), changing shape, killer cats and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the 2 main characters and too many cameos to try to distract them from the simple fact that it is not explained enough to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
