I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I loved the movie, even "without fail", that I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought I and II and I started to laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing of "Deathstalker I" was funny at any level and when the credits came out, I felt embarrassed and sorry I bought it. Too much ugliness and nakedness. I think "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar, that is, stupid, carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed like a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" since I'll return it tomorrow. Now I will probably just throw away this DVD since I can not return it and nobody wants it, including me! So really, do not bother with this. Even nudity (a lot of it, by the way) is boring and unpleasant.
