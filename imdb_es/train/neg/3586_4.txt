The autobiography of the founder of the zoo in New York begins being very beautiful and would be a great family movie if he stayed there. however, we get more and more involved with reality as the gorilla grows and becomes wild that is not easy to fulfill the wishes of his "mother": this could scare younger children, especially. Scenes where Buddy tries to hurt Gertrude. Pretty fast resolution at the end. below the average.
