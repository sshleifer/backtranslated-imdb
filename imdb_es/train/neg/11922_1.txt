Some so-called illegal asylums arrive in Stuttgart and find that the Germans are "racists". <br /> <br /> This is just another smoldering nugget already forgotten in a long list of post-World War II anti-German propaganda films, aimed at making Germans feel "bad" by not receiving all and each one of the degenerates in his country. You can chase the blond Germans and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for good German movies in General, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europe Europe" and "Lola rennt." <br /> <br /> But not this. <br /> <br /> Also, "Das Experiment", with the same male actor from "Lola Rennt".
