This movie was positively the worst movie I've ever seen. I could not sit through the whole thing. I also think that the writer must have some strange fetish for women who pee, vomit and shit ... I mean what it is! I can not believe that this has been done and I am disgusted to have to pay a rental fee of Â£ 4. The quality of both the image and the sound is terrible, the acting ... well, it does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie and the scenes of urine, shit and vomit remind 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID AT ANY COST! The girls seemed to have been taken off the street and they only got the part because they would be willing to take off the top ... Although these girls have pretty bodies, they certainly did not compensate for the fact that their screams were horrible. unconvincing and a pain to my ears. <br /> <br /> This was like (possibly worse) than an amateur school production without a proper address and there is no need for a set, since everything seems to revolve around a car ?! <br /> <br /> Definitely not to buy people. I am sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think that I can save someone else by wasting their money as I have done.
