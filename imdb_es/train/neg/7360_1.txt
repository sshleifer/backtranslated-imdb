This is one of the worst action movies I've seen in my life. This is due in particular to a large part of the objective improbability (as an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making it clear that he is talking to someone through a wire or at the scene where scientists assume that it is safe to enter a room where the virus has been released even though "you have not found a viable host" does not mean that you will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was badly built to look like a dungeon) and poor performance. It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a lethal virus capsule. However, the bandleader who decides to remove him from a bank security box does so at the same time that a bank robbery occurs, at the same time the FBI agents have been informed and at the same time a terrible earthquake. . It goes without saying that the consequences of the earthquake are confusing in more than one way. However, the results are not an attractive action movie, but one that has obviously been grade-one trash since the beginning of the movie. (Perhaps this is the reason why some of the screenshots in the package seem to be created with computer graphics instead of actual screenshots of several sequences of the movie). What the hell was Ron Perlman doing on this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was as ashamed to be in him as he had been watching him.
