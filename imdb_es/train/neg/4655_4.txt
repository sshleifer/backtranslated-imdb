I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The initial moments, with a naked woman stretched out and a painter, Diana, about to paint it and then suck her blood to drain it to be used in her art, give the impression that this could be an artistic experience. vampire movie. It turns out that this initial impression is false. Oh, Troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they offer something that is garbage but fun and with at least some competition for the art of junk food (or, sometimes, not). This is a case in which it is not even very fun to see him, since his attempts at humor (ie, the protagonist's father is an old Vaudevillian who impresses Jimmy Durante?) They are weak at best, and any unintentional laughter is undermined by Sergio Lapel's haggling the basement address. <br /> <br /> And not without him trying, oh Lord no. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, of course, but the way they were used in the film made me, a former filmmaker and would-be director, sulk in my seat: if I saw him in a movie theater he would have to blind me to the view. eyes in many cases, and he would wonder if his DP really understood the basic configuration of 3-point lighting. While this, coupled with a very dull sound design (or just a random and loud buzzing like in the art gallery scene), should not be something that catches your attention during a Troma release, it should be something * basic * that a filmmaker can approach even if the script is not very funny or scary (and it is not) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed at odd moments. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie in any sense, and maybe if you're an intransigent vampire (or just a vampire period) you might have some appeal as a low-income alternative in the bargain basement for Near Dark, or as a slight improvement compared to the 1972 Blood Freak. You have better ways to waste your time, in general.
