An exceptionally horrible story that I can hardly put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims appears at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is a possibility that I missed some crucial elements of the plot, since I could have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was. The box in which the film comes shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was attracted to the crude images of the torture of slavery and the promises of a 'sexy horror film and European junk'. I get the feeling that this was the budget version and that almost a quarter of the movie was left out. Everything good is more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made as much sense as the end of the new movie 'The Planet of the Apes'. Look at this with a friend and a bottle of difficult things. You will need it.
