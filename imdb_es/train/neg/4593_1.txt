As a physics student, I have noticed many idiot professors and other so-called experts in this field. As I continue my studies, I learn more and more about the real physics experiments that are being done and about the people who are doing things right. <br /> <br /> Then, my friends tell me this "physics movie". I want to see. When I do not know anything about that, I'm excited, hoping that the information is presented well. <br /> <br /> I've done a REAL quantum mechanics; This was not the case. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with the basic assumption that everything that happens to a subatomic particle can, and will, come to mind if you open your eyes. Let's think about that, for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are formed by around 10 ^ 30 subatomic particles. That's a trillion trillion trillion trillion particles! The most "mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles can have a 50% chance of canceling each other completely. As you add more and more particles to the mix, it is almost impossible to have a large quantum net result. To tell us that we believe that this is a valid assumption, without rationality behind it ... it is stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts during the course of this film. . But they were presented in the most deceptive way I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same about the neuronal part of the film, since I have not had any kind of medical training. It seemed as if I had had a little more truth, remembering my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least this movie had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever) were actually scene. Not to ruin the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to a wedding, where he sees all the different types of personalities "driven" by their peptides *, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced ​​between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a completely CG scene, full of dancing peptides. The film, at that time, tried to tell us how we are "addicted to emotions", so they invite us to the full song of that great success, "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene was redeeming, because anyone who can go through that scene and still take this film seriously ... well, you are the ones who need to "open your eyes".
