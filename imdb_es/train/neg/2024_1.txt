Trying to take advantage of the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this unconvincing excuse for entertainment: Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' dress in bright red attire. The contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as "Which team lost ...". with three options, A, B or C, each of which completes the sentence. The contestant has three opportunities to give an answer to one of these 3 options. The host, William Shatner, in his most intelligent indignation, asks the participant if he wants to "secure the answer" and when the participant says yes, he chooses a "dancer", to whom he shouts "Show me the money!" She opens a scroll that has a quantity, and if her answer was correct, he adds that amount to her earnings; If I was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (Therefore, theoretically, it is possible that a competitor in this sad tragedy ends up owing Shatner's money.) There is also an "Assassin's Letter" and if the competitor chooses the girl who has that vile roll, but has responded correctly. nothing happens. If he has responded badly, the game enters Sudden Death and he has to answer another question. If he makes a mistake, he leaves with nothing. <br /> <br /> Before going to the commercials, Shatner shouts "Let's dance" and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake the booty. At the end of the program, Shatner asks the ladies "one last dance" and they all shake it a little more. <br /> <br /> I give this program 6 episodes at the most, at that moment, I hope it's pathetic. The excuse for a game will show the door. (It could have been worse: they could have bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host, although I bet he is a better dancer than 'Shat', as they call him these days). <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what! I was wrong! It lasted only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
