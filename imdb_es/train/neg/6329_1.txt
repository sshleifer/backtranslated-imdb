I saw this cinematic misery in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when the tickets sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever seen (with my friend, while the idiocy that is the sketch of the "Laser Bra 2000" was on screen). Obviously, the reaction of my friend and mine was very common. It's not that I thought the movie was offensive (either at age 18 or now), but that it's stupid and obviously extravagant, lacking in the inadvertent humor that makes an Ed Wood movie show up. This is the real reason why NBC refused to broadcast it, instead of not understanding Mr. Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to take the film's supporters to bankruptcy) . <br /> <br /> I was surprised to this day that this movie does not seem to have published any list of "10 Worst Movies of All Time". It certainly does mine. You have been warned.
