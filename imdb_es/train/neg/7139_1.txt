Redline is an imitation of Fast & Furious, without any of the redeeming qualities. You do not need to have a complicated plot with multiple twists and surprises, but you need SOMETHING! This is the equivalent of a porn movie, where the plot and the dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that this is worse, because you do not get the value of your money. Astonishingly boring, impossible racing sequences and a terrible waste of beautiful beautiful cars, which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this film. Sure, she's good, but who's so desperate to have a woman on the screen? I feel that the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and fragments of plot, and waved an 8 ball each time they changed the scene. No person would be competing or knowing anything about it would see this movie and enjoy the scenes of the race.
