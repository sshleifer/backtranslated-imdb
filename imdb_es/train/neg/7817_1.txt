At first I was glad to know about a new Superman movie, I thought it would be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> It's a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain who does not do anything else, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as Donner's first film, just a bit forced. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple. (All the things that Luthor finds in a museum or in an old woman). <br /> <br /> The story is not right, it must be Kevin Smith's script and it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just wait for a sequel without Brian Singer and a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> everyone read later
