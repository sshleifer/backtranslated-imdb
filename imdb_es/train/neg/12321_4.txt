Seeing that I hate to read long essays hoping to find a point and disappointed, first I will tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Frankly terrible And no, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him, because he gave the film the rank it deserved, but they reprimanded me sadly when they read what he said. I am quite ashamed to have the same side as someone who commented that the movie "definitely lacks attractive women". Let me be the first to say, "Wow, that was definitely a serious in-depth review there, my mind can hardly understand the philosophical reflections on this movie." Seriously, however, the lack of "beautiful women" should not be considered essential for a movie. If you are desperate enough to be "beautiful women", you should see other types of movies, not necessarily in the science fiction category.
