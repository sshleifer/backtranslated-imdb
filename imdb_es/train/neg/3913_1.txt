['This movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes. Except for the names of the characters, the film is very similar to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters that are represented, for the most part, by non-Latinos. There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And to eliminate a complete generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what you should read!']
