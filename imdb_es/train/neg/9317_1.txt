I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said that the reason it was so cheap was because the record had been scratched, but he did not mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the movie was a poor effort that stunk more than Paris Hilton In a hotel video room at home. Speaking of home videos, since when has it been a fair game to release them as movies? I mean, movies that employ actors, technicians and scriptwriters, etc., no longer, only gather their friends and their ideas. for the weekend, lavish the production with a budget of £ 8.00 and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack); then, put it on the shelves, by a poor fool (me), to take it home alone. despair. But here's the deciding factor: I got ahead of most of this and threw it aside, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, while watching a horror "Hellbreed" by Darren Day (£ 1.99 to take house and avoid a different Blockbuster). Now, this movie made 'Grim Weekend' look like The Exorcist, so I slapped Grim Weekend to catch up with some of the moments featured on the wonderful IMDb boards, which the viewers said were fun . Indeed, once I overcame the misery, the pain and the horror of realizing that the Grim Weekend was a complete toast, I could enjoy, taste and frankly put myself to the funny thing. And there is a lot of that. Check the tables. Then check the movie. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
