No, this was not one of the ten worst movies of the 1980s, but it certainly skirts the last 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects before "An American Werewolf in London"? The club is still considered great and Ronald Reagan is not. The 40th president of the United States? While we're at it, let's not overlook the hairstyles of the 70s in the 50s and 60s. I've seen more of that here than in "Happy Days" & "Laverne & Shirley" combined. <br /> <br /> The only woman who elevates this film to the category of "so bad, it's good" was late. , great Elizabeth Hartman, but hardly. Biff plays Miss Montgomery, the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that has been killed and that Hollywood is still producing it, but even as a "hot girl" she retains her mousey qualities. Your call for help is evidence of this. She also looks a lot better like Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon, shot into hell." She was not kidding. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there are not good parts in other places, they are few and far between, and I do not just say it because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. "Teen Wolf too" was better than this, and that was not so good. <br /> <br />
