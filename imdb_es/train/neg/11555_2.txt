['A great slasher movie, very bad was that of the producers and not part of the script. Summary of the basic plot: the man with fetish redhead will invite these women to his apartment only to enter some kind of monstrous coma and proceeds to offer varying degrees of success. Only the cutting team behind the scenes should have thought that the film was as publicity as I did and cut it out of the movie. Nothing flows, you lose with what redhead she is at that moment (did not she remove that earlier one?), And most of the time it seems that the man in the camera fainted and resumed filming when he woke up. Not that I can blame him, I fainted two or three times and had to rewind and resume to try to recover the small plot that exists. Warning when you see the end DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happened before, you will only get an aneurysm. It is not worth the time, the effort, or that God forbids money. The only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 is the slightest chance that the hack happened between the release of the movie and the horrible version I saw.']
