A long time ago, when I was renting videos, I chose this one. OOPS The things that I wanted to mention outside of the summary that I have already given are these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with this movie had a strange and sick fascination with food, it was rude and unnecessary. 2: There is a kind of soundtrack in the back of the movie that seems to be there all the time and, from the way I felt for days after seeing this crap, I think they had something subliminal on the track. Either that or it was simply traumatically bad or both. Many times throughout the film it can be said that the writer and the director did not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about acting.
