I entertain easily. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and its many sequels, even when most people found them unbearable. I have even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore's films. I've only seen a movie that, honestly, I can say it was bad ... and it was. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a silly movie, why did I see it?" Honestly, it's the only movie I can not recommend.
