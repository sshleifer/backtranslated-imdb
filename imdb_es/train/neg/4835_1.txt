Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young American in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul, operating wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he occasionally takes a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of approximately 3000 yards. Finally, he is promoted to sergeant, but can not decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he leaves the army completely. A year later, frustrated with civil life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.
