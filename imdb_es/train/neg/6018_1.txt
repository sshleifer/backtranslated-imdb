I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we should make films like "Left Behind". We have much better stories to tell that do not have to be so preached. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as the perfect example of what I'm not going to do with my film career.
