It was 1974 and it was starring Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> That just says what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the movie, Slovik had reformed, had a good woman and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may have been naive innocent, or may have wanted to manipulate him. The system. <br /> <br /> Whoever Slovik was or has not been for the story to decide, but this was a movie that dealt with desertion at a time when a country was questioning why he was fighting, and the movie took Sides. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the military that was in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell the truth, it was about the Vietnam War, not about the Second World War), EoES was like Propagandist how Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this movie, Slovik declared his position, plain and simple. I had a nervous problem. Hell, I have a nervous clinical condition, and believe me, if I had done military service, it would not have been a problem for me to let my nerves vanish in my tasks and get degraded or fulfill the duty of KP or latrine service without problems. <br /> <br /> If we believe that the cable car, Slovik did not have that option, no doubt due to his criminal record. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe depends on the viewer. I learned that the films of this decade or decade, when dealing with service or military service, will have practically the same position over and over again. <br /> <br /> The decades of 1940 and 1950 serve your country. <Br /> <br /> The decades of 1960 and 1970, make fun of your country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and only when he was being tied up to be executed shows emotion. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could have been useful to his advantage in his statement of his nervous condition, but obviously the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die becomes sad. <br /> <br /> I am not a Catholic, but I thought of the recital of the greeting Mary by Ned Beatty and Brillo at the end, with the Lord's prayer, it was funny, as it seemed that they were trying to see who could say it faster . <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie could be seen without realizing that it was directed to Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it's worth it for Slovik and Anyone who chooses to follow his example.
