The first thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. He is not exuding nakedness or anything, but much that was not necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman who believes in the ghost stories of their families that her ancestor, who resembles her strangely, was a werewolf, and believes that her destiny is destined to be the same. What I found really interesting. The original Wolf Man was meant to be a completely psychological film, but Universal launched the real Wolfman you should never have seen for a dollar or two extra. I find this concept interesting of someone who is not really a werewolf. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that he's not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no emotion or kink, they also try to make the movie look like this really happened. script. They also fail there by adding one or two parts of the movie that refer to this being true. At the beginning I was thrilled to read the description of the film. But little by little I realized that it was a cover only so that they could expose the main characters the breasts as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is a decent actor who plays a great psychotic role or a really bad actor who plays an actor Psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brain and is just a nutcase who runs like crazy and growls and snaps like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. He has moments when his performance breaks for a scary moment, but he is quickly ruined by the work and the light of the camera. The idea is great, but horribly executed throughout the film. 3/10
