The dead eyes of Josh Hartnett, the thick writing of it, and Harrison Ford are in a friend-police comedy. Here are 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it and better use 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> Friends' cops movies are fun. However, its true golden age dates back to the 80s and 90s. Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the Hollywood police is a good idea, but the end result was not at least a parody of subgenre, but a reason to ask God to have mercy on all. past films of the same type, while the worst of them was, of course, greater than (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What really happened with this entertaining formula? For a whole decade, things had not been the same. You would have a stubborn flop of Buddy Action after another. I will delight you with some titles to catch the disaster: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of all yet. (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I think one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar movies and TV shows for 2 decades. Add to that, particularly here, negligent treatment and boring humor. Actually the issue this time is totally unbearable. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal policemen who have a second job and the background of the sinful city, but what else was new? It is not a cliché; It is a matter of few renovations mixed with clichés where both have been done badly. <br /> <br /> The acting, especially on the (Hartnett) side, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor). So his character was wanting revenge for his father's death! Revenge on you, man, he probably died to see your performance! Even small roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they looked like here anyway!). The direction fails to present something that is comical or so hard, some parts managed to be highly boring (arrest the black man through the lack ??); It's a weird moment to be bored in what is supposed to be action / comedy! They did not use the same Hollywood, either as an ironic place where there is an ugly face behind superficial charm, or even as a place full of bright stars or falls (cameos that might have given some interesting moments). <Br /> <br /> It's a very easy movie that is transmitted to be visible only by the glamor of its stars, and like a Buddy-cop movie to become one of the worst cases of 2 stars without chemistry in the screen (One of them has no chemistry with the screen itself! Guess who !!), and a destroyer Buddy-Cop more than a movie! God, do not make me, or my children, live long enough to witness (Hollywood Homicide - Part 2)! Finally, look at the performance of Harrison Ford, I wanted to have a good time, but at least we did not.
