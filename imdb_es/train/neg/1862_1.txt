It is not just the plot that makes this film become an instant for boring audiences. It is the terrible direction with a horrible script and the errors on the left and on the right which makes this too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Only the emotion of pointing out the many mistakes and the stupidities of a line. Well, I wonder what fools think the directors of your production company when this movie was presented for the first time. Probably as stupid as that sheriff who dove into the truck full of antifreeze with a bleeding wound open. Ups! Did I forget to mention that this sheriff is not only a bad actor but can also shrug with a load of antifreeze soaking the exposed flesh? I guess he forgot when he won a not-so-exciting victory over the snowman.
