I just watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's a disaster. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ends up being more annoying than funny here and the movie is more or less a new version of the classic "Santa Claus the movie" from the fucking 80, but without the camp or the bad song of Sheena Easton at final. The story is his flight of black sheep in the family that returns to face his family for the holidays, but with the North Pole as the scenario. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family mess that comes home after a series of setbacks that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo role) abandoning him, so he comes home to face his Parents and their most successful brother, Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and the extravagant wackos continue with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky that threatens all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'd be right because it's predictable to the hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same loser that he always plays, but this time ends up being more annoying than nice, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than a single note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but not her. Much of a character that is not a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little more anal. The only two actors that come out of this film with their dignity intact are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and was enthusiastic about his role as Santa Claus, but he seems a bit embarrassed to be in the film and you can not blame him or to Rachel. Weisz, who manages to do much more with a very small role than most of the main actors, which is a shame because Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much more than what this script gave them. <br /> <br /> In a few words, a big disappointment.
