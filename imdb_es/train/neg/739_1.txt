Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin with the first wrong step, assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all his lines must be taken seriously. That simply is not true. Wells was an heir to the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction could leave the British unprepared for the world that the new technology could produce, both good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two terrible consequences follow: the protagonist is represented as a weak cry (I remembered Fay Wray in the original King Kong), instead of a man who struggles to live the ironies of an incredible catastrophe; and the dialogue stinks of the 'victorianisms' that say that Welles clearly intended to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget to squander on CGI effects, which by this way, the Warner Bros. cartoon factory of the 1940s could have I did a better job. (The drops of blood spattered like red balloons, I hoped they would disappear at any moment). Think of the Yellow Submarine as the old EC comics did. <br /> <br /> Worse yet is the loss of theme, which steals the movie of any reason to exist. Although the creators of this film return history to their Victorian era, they completely miss the strange way in which Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of World War I, a fact that Wells himself did not go unnoticed. of the war, he went back to work. topic in The way of things to come. <br /> <br /> Without any subject, all we have here is a lot of people running and throwing themselves in cartoon balloons, when they are not trying for a high school production. of the rewriting of a drunken Macbeth student. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is the most insensitive and pointless nonsense piece that I have suffered since a friend convinced me to see the East European caricature "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. . That movie was so stupidly boring, my friend and I and two strangers stopped ridiculing it halfway, and we sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light to see the cards. It is your only utility, as for what any of us could say. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this clearing of Wells at all. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie: steal all the copies you can (do not pay a penny) and burn each and every one of them. God in his wisdom created us only for this purpose.
