Do you want a great recipe for failure? Take a plot, add some weak, completely underdeveloped characters and add the worst special effects that a horror movie has ever known. Let stand for a week (the amount of time probably spent doing this garbage). The result is Corpse Grinders, a film that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places. <br /> <br /> The movie exploded completely. My words can not express how painful it was to look. This is not one of those bad movies in which you and your friends can sit and mock. This is not Plan 9 from outer space. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've seen. I get depressed when I realize that people really took the time of their lives to act on this crap, if you can call it acting. But more than anything, when you have a bad address, a bad writing of stories, a bad performance, the last thing is to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a huge and unpleasant turd that you want to leave quickly. Fearful that a friend or loved one can see it in some way. Actually, I can somehow destroy all the copies of this film, so that it does not contaminate the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new respect for every movie I've seen. You have shown me what is really horrible, and that is why you should appreciate all those movies that are simply unpleasant or boring.
