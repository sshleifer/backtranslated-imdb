If you look at the information of Corey Large here in IMDb, apparently there is a movie called "Reload" in production (since June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how does such a bad movie ever win a sequel ... and second, did not Sebastian die at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I saw him in the early hours of the morning, when he was fighting insomnia, so he was drifting in and out while he was on. I'm sure I lost some points in the plot, but in general, it seemed very weak. The performance of Large was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I am also a bit surprised of all the people who comment on the beautiful girls, because I thought that the actress who played Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
