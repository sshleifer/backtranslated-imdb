When I go to see a movie about zombies, I do not expect performances of caliber oscar, nor write at the level of the Godfather, but I hope that the actors, at least, do not resemble their effort to read their cards and dialogue. that does not sound like it was written 10 minutes before the actor read it on the camera. This movie was horrible, I actually got up and went about 25 minutes, I went to the next door and I saw Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good either, but it seemed that Citizen Kane was compared to this pile of garbage. On the positive side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for more than the first 5 minutes, in fact, I left after they killed the sexiest, there was nothing that interested me . after that.
