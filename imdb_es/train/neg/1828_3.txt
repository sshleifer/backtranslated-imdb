I saw 'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, in a house of friends. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but that does not meet. I saw him with about five friends and nobody laughed at the whole movie. The jokes (which are few and far away) are NOT fun at all ... the story is crap, and they never answer the question ... WHERE DOES THE SH * T GO? Of course, the answer to that is that nobody cares. This movie lacks comedy value and, as other users have said, the only thing that makes it worth seeing is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters is developed, the arguments are so fine that they are almost transparent, and is that song supposed to be fun throughout the movie?
