I saw this in the hope of discovering something I did not know about the most infamous man in modern history and I could not help thinking that the story had been rewritten in HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to shoot one of his admirers. Hitler appeared with a pistol in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but the writers have not confused Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? It's bad enough, but what really offended me was missing entire fragments of historical context in this mini series. Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a high price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone, anyone, to restore their pride and that is why they resorted to Nazism. The German humiliation caused by the allied powers in the 1920s seems to be completely absent, so there is no way that HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and Goering be conscientious by its absence <br /> <br /> There is a positive point about the miniseries and that is Robert Carlyle in the lead role. Well, some of his manners are erroneous and his voice is a little too loud (the recordings of the Archive show that Hitler had a soft and seductive voice) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and manages to communicate Hitler's own charisma on the screen. The comments in the British press that Carlyle is more like the Sparks synthesizer than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and gives one of Hitler's best interpretations. <br /> <br /> I liked Robert Carlyle's performance but I hated everything else. about this miniseries and I wondered why the hell it was done in the first place. There is nothing to recommend it to the fans of history.
