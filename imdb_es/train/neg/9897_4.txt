I thought it was a good movie to pass the time, but not because of any possibility of historical value. The performance of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The turn of events is ... fun! She gave birth while feeding her people! Oh, please ... a pregnant Egyptian queen (especially this one) would not bother going from one room to another for that reason! They tried to make her look like a saint for the love of God! And the way they tried to justify her by murdering her own sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the best policy of her time. His decisions were based on everything but his feelings and morals. He did it all for only two reasons: power and self-preservation! He was born into a family where he had to fight to survive, something he did very well. Anything that got in his way was killed (his brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and also ... gay to be seduced. Then, he was his end ...
