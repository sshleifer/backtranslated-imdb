Hard men, attractive women, many oaths and a very unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. One would think that "Monster" would be fun ... but in reality it is not. However, the stars Tony Eisley and John Carradine do, and in my book it makes it worth seeing at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford, who only directed the video with his sons Andrea and Glenn (portraying characters called Andrea and Glenn, in a particularly inventive turn) - received full credit. Considering how horrible the end result was, Strock was probably glad he was not accredited! "Monster" looks like a television movie from the mid-to-late seventies, so I like to leave it in the background from time to time. As entertainment, it falls flat on its face, but as a reminder of another era and a kind of missing film, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
