I started watching this movie with great expectations. However, after an hour I gave up this movie, since it only instilled many unanswered questions. This already started in the initial sequence and only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury the Hollanders under a statue? Why is there a present Italian comedian? Why did the farmer's wife save the Hollander? Why, being saved, did he not run for his life instead of making love to the farmer's wife? Why did not the farmer's wife save the Hollanders at a time when the farmer would not be there? Why do these allegedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why the Italian comedian knew about the gold of the Dutch? Why did he hide it in the well in the middle of the property of the evil farmers? These and many more questions appeared, and none of them seemed to be answered in an acceptable manner. So I guess I'm totally missing the point of this movie, and I'm not connecting with the story in any way ...
