Possibly the most beautiful woman in show business and the sexiest, Debbie offers another excellent performance here. Although his work on American Nightmare was far superior, it is still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with the typical types of Melrose Place, chiseled features and seductive curves I've never seen before. . Apart from Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress she had seen before, in Delta Delta Die similar. <br /> <br /> The plot centers around a group of arrogant Californians who start poor naive Debbie Rochon in her clique. They tell her they have a murder club and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these great people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she got mad at her joke. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Fantastic!) Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered everywhere and all murder scenes are done on your face, Gore's bloodhounds will surely enjoy!) < br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Also abundant!) Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes, as do many of the actresses and actors with no name.The pool party seems to be just an excuse to undress everyone, men and women alike, Julie Strain also has a topless cameo, but she disappears after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (I could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a filler between nude scenes.) I understand that B-Rate movies use the nudity often, but this is an excessive limit). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (The performance is below normal.) Rochon is always in Reat, easily the best category B actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a good job as an object of Debbie's lust, but the other actors had nothing to write about.
