Nowadays it is a kind of tendency to see all the shows of the early 90s as classics (people are easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were / are undoubtedly good, this is just shit. I watched this program a lot in those days, since I had MANY repetitions on TV at the time, and even when I was a kid I did not like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how much people are overacting in Power Rangers, and to what extent special effects have sucked even then. When the program does not resort to painfully bad "fight" scenes, it torments the viewer with this unnecessary telenovela about a group of teenagers and their small social problems from time to time. I do not know anything about you, but I did not care about that at all, and it's basically stuffed until you have to "fight" with a guy again in a clich√© alien suit with fireworks or some toy. -robot. You never feel 'involved' in any way with this show, and the fact that most actors act as if they really do not have any interest at all, plus their wallet only enhances the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing memorable in this program, and it is quite surprising that it has had so many side effects (Beetleborgs is a good example). However, everything is just a quick way to earn some money. I challenge any "fan" to tell me what exactly stands out in the episodes that are supposed to be so good because I could not find anything that is even a little attractive to children. My guess is that most of the Power Rangers "fanatics" will tell me that "I just do not understand" anyway, or something like that. Although I really do not care; This was crap back then and it still sucks.
