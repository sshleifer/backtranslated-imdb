During the Christmas holidays, a group of friends from the university stays behind to help prepare the dormitories to be demolished and replaced by apartment buildings. To make the job a bit more difficult, a murderous psychopath using Chucks is roaming the halls of the residence, attacking the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 'video nasties On the UK list in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood Dripped had a good reputation created before its first visit. The term 'unpleasant video' reminds me of some images of some big explicit gore, violence, sex, etc.: All the things that a horror fan dreams of. So, after hearing all that information, I settled into Pranks (alternative title) expecting a sleazy slasher experience. . . And that's what it tried to be, but it completely failed. Visually, the movie is not great. The cinematography, the gore (except for a couple of scenes) and the general direction fail. It just is not nice to see. The non-original script lacks and often throws random things without any real reason (such as the initial death). There are some great scenes of death, including a fusion of pretty faces (which can be seen on the poster), but that's the positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story does not seem important, the killer is not cold or scary, and suffers the only major mistake that any slasher movie should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, for a movie made by a few UCLA film students for $ 90,000 (which would be more than double than today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a total disaster. It has a couple of good things, and it's quite observable. . . But, like a slasher movie that seeks to be at the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it simply can not be compared. Do not expect much, and at least you can be entertained. I hate to say it, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would actually be better with a remake. . . And yet, they go after great works like Black Christmas. Oh good. . . <br /> <br /> Mandatory Horror Elements: <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally cool murders, and Gore is fine in the Most. . . But nothing special. In addition, they eliminated some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unattractive nudity (for me), but not much. <br /> <br /> - Great Assassin (s): Nah. The final monologue (s) of the murderer made him quite insensitive. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A scare scare or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I guess so, but I just did not care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
