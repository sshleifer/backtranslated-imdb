One of the worst romantic comedies (no, worst movies) I've seen. The child (who works as a telephone psychic) ​​should pretend to be gay to move into the apartment with the woman of his dreams. Hilarity does not occur. Boredom, violence against homosexuals and horrible dialogue do it. If you read Brad Meltzer and you like his horrible dialogue, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this If you see it, destroy the copy.
