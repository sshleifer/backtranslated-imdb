Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Bored, insipid and devoid of imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could be the protagonist of this movie. The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance. Baransky was great as always and provided the only minimum of interest in the whole matter. Probably their participation was the only reason why this project was lit with green light, to begin with. Maybe I'm waiting too long for a movie for life that was filmed 15 days after Christmas, but I sat to think that with a different director and a new JJ with an actress that could at least provoke sympathy, this could have been a small and beautiful movie. .
