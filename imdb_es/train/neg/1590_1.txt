HAH! So this is the movie that the "Stars of the next action" were getting into. Well, I'm glad I did not participate and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how you can see the first 10 seconds (!) And decide? about a movie! Well then! Just look at those titles! I saw this movie (or part of this "teleplay game" since it was produced for television and we could not bear to see it all) one night while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical imbroglio. guys that from time to time see shows like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar was not really high, the most watched movie of my group was Girl Next Door (and it was not for the great script, D. But the total lack of originality, acting, script and almost everything in this movie) something else What makes a movie good makes it easy to switch channels to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I do not remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group. And that's weird (!) For God's sake Do not do it for this movie! If it's on television, then yes, look at it. And reflect on it. My conclusion, well, since Joel Silver has produced some of the best action movies (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to mention a few) I can only say that the producers do not give the film its quality, but they provide money to the directors. And selling this movie just because it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious shortcomings of the crew that really did it.
