If you've seen Friends, the writing will feel very familiar. Especially, the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The program is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still quite young (approximately 10 years old, I think). Now, they are in their twenty-fifth year and they meet again in a class meeting. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several story lines at once. Usually, they are not connected in any way. Each story line is divided into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> The sketches are where my problems are with this series. As in the past seasons of Friends, it is often a pretty silly scenario with difficult situations to believe. One of the main characters does something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is then very exaggerated, as if it were not foolish enough. If you like this kind of humor on your face, maybe you like this series. For me it is a great detour. <br /> <br /> The reason I started seeing Friends is because of the first seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance that encourages the characters. The class does not have any of this. The characters are simply too forced and the stereotypes are pushed too far. Therefore, it is not possible to relate to them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, several seasons passed before they ran out and all the character traits were eliminated. But in The Class, it looks like it has run out of steam before it even started.
