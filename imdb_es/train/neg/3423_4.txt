This is a smooth-core sex game typical of the 70s in the Russ Meyer genre, although it may be less bizarre than some of Meyer's works. This film has "production values" higher than many of its contemporaries, which suggests a larger budget. However, its plot, writing and performance are directly from zone B, however. In recent times, this movie has become a mainstay of B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the universe of 500 channels. If you agree with the soft core, this is as "good" as anything else in the B range. However, do not wait for Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more and nothing less. The performance of Jennifer Welles as the "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film went on to greater fame, as expected. The confessions of a young American housewife are far from being the worst example of her kind. It's mirable, if this is your kind of movie. 30 years ago, this would have been a cutting edge film and risk. You can see more or less the same kind of things in the Showtime / HBO series these days, and in prime time.
