No, I'm not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be expelled from the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all, and they only consist of traveling to foreign places, having a problem that they solve easily, expecting to be popular and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me your name. These "movies" are bad excuses to be on television and go to other countries. There is a reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure that when they were very young and did some O.K. Movies, some studio boss bought all his rights for 15 years, or something like that, so now that they're 17, they can make movies in other countries when they want to use the studio money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
