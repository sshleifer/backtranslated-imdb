Surely it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like a conventional Westerner. Instead, it's a movie of a female sheriff. Make no mistake, although this is a bad movie about a female sheriff. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is shot to death; She is a little annoyed by this. Its main objective is to pursue the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a man to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the murderer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, since anyone killed in this movie has to thank the new sheriff. He had more than a few opportunities to put the killer behind bars, but I suppose, as he liked it, he would not. The murderer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons that are also quite foolish. This movie is very boring and it's not worth watching ... it's not one of the best episodes of MST3000 that they did. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it much more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know that he should not make people go to one place and go out to another.
