I was not as in love with this as many other critics. Sure, he has a couple of lovely girls playing erotic vampires, lesbians. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful sirens with razor teeth that run to the cars on a secluded road, hooked up to their house (at sunset) and invite their prey ... men hungry for sex to their boudoir. What happens there ... well, after they get naked and kiss mainly, they kill their visitors. The director José Ramón Larraz has some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are quite spooky and are filmed effectively, but sex alone does not stop a movie (there is no play on words ... at least consciously). There really is not much history here. We have the two girls. We are shown an inexplicable and inexplicable beginning where we see them shot with a gun. Why? What does it mean "why does the guy who stays for several days greet a man at the hotel who insists that he has known him for years? Does he have that purpose?" Of course, I have even more general questions such as what is a couple? Anyway, the script is riddled with such defects and is very scarce in the action outside the victims, the wine and the dinner - they (quite literally), and then they go to bed in the crypt.The ending begins with some more scenes juicy, but it's anti-climatic There are, as I said, some effective scenes of the director ... I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the forest in search of their prey The house is also a set very impressive, and both girls are, as I said, very beautiful, Marianne Morris in particular stands out, in more ways than one, for you Bessie Love, a silent screen veteran and a silent screen veteran, has a brief cameo End of the movie.
