Now here is a movie that if it had been made in Australia it would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyed, here it is, limp and corny and overheated from the land of Lala. How was the artist so wrong? Well, mainly by taking seriously a job so hilariously surprising that no one in their right mind could be taken seriously. Unless, of course, they were a cliché gay solitary nerd (but somehow cute) ... or is that cliché cluttered over cliche. There is no value in the story that almost looks like a prequel to GERRY by Gus Van Sant ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how is a lead weight? Well, this author must be so angry that he did not get to Burt and BOOGIE first he had to do his. Twisted and undeveloped, apart from the theme 'unrequited love is a bore' that emerges from a faded Streisand lyric, we only have the story of the TV series in a bad mood. The fourth unnecessary act of this extensive turgid drama is truly terrible, since the film fades like the Gerries in the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz, at the end of the 1990s, some 20-somethings made a similar but really hilarious movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, he also suffered from a more horrible author than Orson, so he shot half again, got a ruthless TV editor to cut it up and down to 72 minutes and pay attention to this night ! A lesson there when bad films become good at lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER went rigid when I released it and, after seeing it not working, I can understand why.
