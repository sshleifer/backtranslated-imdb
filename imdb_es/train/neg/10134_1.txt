Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar material, but with each passing release they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This starts when Seagal is picked up by the FBI because he killed some people "in self-defense". The active military is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth aircraft that will be used by the villain "evil English villain" with whom Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film has a terrible Dialogue that almost always comes with a lot of cheese and a lack of talent to act. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it that make no sense and add nothing to the story, the characters in the film as a whole, like the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast that is there purely by titling to get viewers and yet, it does not even title simply confusing, since it does not make sense why it happened when it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with an erroneous dialogue, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only serve to achieve the almost impossible and make the movie worse <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your Live and give this opportunity, even if you are the hottest Seagal fan.
