On the way back from IMC6 (San José, California), the five (tell us, three of us, the Kamal fanatics) had reached a unanimous verdict; VV was a solid shit and, thanks to the movie, we were going to have a very fucked up Monday. Not to mention, we swear to stay out of theaters next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamal here because he somehow left aside a clue in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Script, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing, but we have hardly improved, when it's about Script, Direction and Acting. ") While you watch VV, those words sound very true. <br /> <br /> Now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1 Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I'm barely containing the use of expletives here, but the fact is that HJ has mastered the excellent dexterity of ruining all his recent films (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the discordant cacophony, he plays it as background music, the next time he gets a tympanum transplant, he will pay for it. <br /> 4. Songs Neither the songs help to move the narration of the space movie temporarily nor do they make you sit down and take note. It seems that it is made of four VERY long songs with some scenes. n among them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short gone too far. At best, VV is a short story, not a 2-hour "thriller". To use a cliché here, like Bunny Energizer, it goes on and on and on; Only in this case do you not want me to do it. The back of a movie feels like a big load. <br /> <br /> 6. Pairing Kamal-Jothika Two ice cubes rubbed together could have produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There is no reason why you want them to do it together. In fact, every time they meet in the second half of the movie, they are a good irritant for the narrative. I hate to say this, but the 10-minute romance of Kamalini Mukerjhee does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this film plus 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Accent of Kamal Haasan Kamal has this pretentious accent that no one speaks in India or the United States; and it is not new either. He has been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It simply gets on the nerve. Imagine the chaos it can cause when your ability to use this strange accent is combined with filming in the US. UU Of course, he does not leave it at Immigration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered TN Cops of Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in the Kamanglish breed ("Who we have here is just bad police work"), of course. Nauseating effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors that you expect to face on a certain scale. Gautam fails us very much with a horrible performance in the Department of common sense. That D.C.P in his senses would find his love interest in the streets to discuss matters such as committing himself and life afterwards! The scene inside the theater was so bad, towards the climax; We could listen to the people behind us loudly challenge the hero's IQ. "Is he stupid, can not he use his Siren or Lights?" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal, the policeman, the Jeep, chases a guy on a bicycle, like any ordinary guy!). "Can not you just use your weapon?" ("The guy on a bicycle" starts on foot and we have a fully prepared Kamal in a chase for a considerable time). I will not vote in favor of what follows, but I am only trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and Violence If I wanted to see how women are raped, how they cut their throats, more women who rape them and throw them into the bushes with an unbearable authenticity, I would sit at home and I would see a "Police Report" or "Kuttram." The use of excessive violence must go in a way to spread the story, not to overwhelm it! Somewhere along the line, Gautum seems confused about what extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the pillar (story) is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot Espresso could not remove the pain from the head.
