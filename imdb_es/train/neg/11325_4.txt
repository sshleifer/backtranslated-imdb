In the devastated wasteland of the future, humanity is terrorized by cyborgs robots with human traits that have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. Led by their vicious leader Jōb (Lance Henriksen), the Cyborgs are preparing to overtake Taos, a densely populated human post. <br /> <br /> Can only one force stop the march of Jōb's death? Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy Jōb and his army. <br /> <br /> In the ruins of a looted town, Gabriel finds Nea (Kathy Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by Cyborgs ten years earlier. Now she wants revenge. They made a pact: Gabriel will train Nea on how to fight the Cyborgs and Nea will take Gabriel to Taos. <br /> <br /> Five-time kick-boxing champion Kathy Long has all the right moves in this high-speed adventure. That delivers a lot of action. They also star Gary Daniels (as David) and Scott Paulin (as Simon).
