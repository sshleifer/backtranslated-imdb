I entered into this with my hopes set, at twenty minutes of the film it could not have been more disappointing. Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept hoping that maybe ... maybe someone could do it right this time. Regrettably, Prom Night has the same level of quality as the recent April Fool's remake, bad writing, misdirection, exaggerated acting and horror in general. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end it is boring, repetitive and worthy of a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've done it a million times better than this. If you're going to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say you wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because they laugh. The laughs are not in the points of the movie that are supposed to be fun, but they respond to key "exciting" moments in the film that are so badly made that you feel as if you are watching the latest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a new version or a parody? The filmmakers missed so much of the brand here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended went almost to the middle of the movie. That in retrospect, I would have liked to have done it. However, I did not, I had to torture myself and maintain myself in the hope that it would improve. Needless to say, he did not. The scenes of "horror" are a joke, not even for the performance, but for the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the work of the camera. The film looks like they spent a fortune to produce it, but it still came out with a micro-budget movie. Halfway I expected to see the dollar store labels on some of the accessories and I kept thinking I would see a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary, if this is the future of the horror of the big budget, then the horror genre is doomed.
