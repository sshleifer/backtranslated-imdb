This movie, by Oscar Petersson, is unique. Its uniqueness is not found in history, since many Hollywood productions have served us comparably miserable plots, but rather in the most complete way that a complete and complete business in one aspect is linked to a similar business in all other aspects. <Br /> <br /> The dialogue is worse than embarrassing. Rotten action and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix. Bosnians who speak English with strong Swedish accents add an involuntary element of humor. The uninspired rays and the camera work are the icing on the turkey cake. As a kind of surprise to the public, there are some completely unmotivated slow motion sequences in which you can least expect. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone who has no sense of time. <br /> <br /> The "bad man bad man becomes good after hearing the scene of the good man's speech" in the church, is the point at which it is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position as the worst director of all times; Move over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
