I can not tell you how angry I was after watching this movie. The characters are not the most interesting, and the plot does not exist. Then, after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, with the hope that the last 2 and a half hours will lead to a significant ending, what do we get? A storm of frogs. Now, I understand the references to the bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first, it was presented without any resolution, and second, it would be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (a part of the population) or Charles Fort (an even bigger part). As a fairly read person, I thought that this movie was a poor and self-indulgent imitation of an episode of Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to spend it reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well, to be honest
