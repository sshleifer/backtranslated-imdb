Steven Seagal seems to be sleepwalking through a terrible film shot almost entirely in a close-up to disguise the total lack of budget and resources. To detect technical failures, the F / A-18s and the silver F-14s taken from a carrier for an air strike, and miraculously converted into camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike, would give this film more credibility than the one that deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing about the film is the credit titles that fade and disappear in a lightning erasure, which presumably is available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all your creativity into your own credit places Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
