I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in a movie! The Gingerbread Man starts on the right foot and manages to create great expectations for the end. But at some point the film becomes one of the worst stories I've wasted my time. It is incredibly amazing how the enchanted Mallory Doss manages to pull the character of Kenneth Branagh through his nose. The climax of the cinema is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left in the sun too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie in history and this is not affected by the fact that talented stars crowd the film. Do not waste your time here!
