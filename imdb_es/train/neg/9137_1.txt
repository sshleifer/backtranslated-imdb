What can I say, this is a piece of brilliant film that should have won an Oscar. A copy must be kept secure in a secure vault for posterity. It should be mandatory for all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the writer / director / producer / chef / nanny / walmart most genius in the world to adorn the world of cinema with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so awesome! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, is so attractive that I'm surprised he did not go to Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during the nude scene. I lent this movie to my brother and he phoned me saying that Arthur's nude scene made him gay. Of course, I am totally in favor, thanks to this film and its beautifully designed lessons about tolerance. Why yesterday I burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in its smoldering ashes? <br /> <br /> The cinematography was the best of this movie. When that Fed-Ex plane rose to the skies in the middle of the Vermont palm trees, I cried! Why, I did not even know they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex planes before this movie. It opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's school of Screen Writing, Acting, Direction, Composition, Casting, Production, Production Design and Real Estate. I just want to say: "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich, thank you for bringing this creation to the world, we will never be able to pay you enough."
