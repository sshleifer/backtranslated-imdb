The disturbing A remake, of course. The original was a spooky psychological thriller, and one that has improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it is a classic. There is no character development here, just cartoons (the whore, the authoritative brain, the "I'm going to get out of here" companion, the oh, so sensitive library worm). But, seeing that the special effects were the "star", I suppose that the characters with whom you can identify are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Combine cherubs, elastic doors, irritating dead children who can not speak clearly ... and an idiotically silly ending that makes it more daring to give you an enema of butterflies and rainbows of the new era. I'm going to take my Skittles orally, thanks. Bruce Dern, I like you from "The Cowboys". For.
