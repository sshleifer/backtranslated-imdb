This makes it the third film of Errol Morris I've seen, and every time I do not like his style. It seems that he finds very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries, and then, with the editing in jest, they make fun of everything they try. It's never really a direct caricature of them and Morris seems to say most of the time: "But no, no, these people are really fascinating, actually!", But there are always these small angles inclined and not so subtle editing . techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind his back. <br /> <br /> This movie traces four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies African hairless molerats to discover they are Surprisingly like an ant, a lion tamer, a man that maintains a garden full of animal-shaped bushes and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates the characteristics of animals, humans and life. So, the title of Quick, cheap and out of control really does not seem to mean anything in terms of the movie ... right? Except that, of course, Morris seems a little disturbed by the passions of these individuals (who might call them "obsessions") making synthetic designs in life. I do not share that fear and, frankly, I do not appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But I insist on its subtlety. Without a voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it is not as if Morris had ever put that anxiety in the collective heads of the spectators. Instead, he mixes the material of the circus and the material of the ant often when they are removed from the context of the circus and the ants, showing a kind of collective absurdity behind what all these people talk about. I do not find them absurd, I find them very neat and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he did not claim such juxtapositions, which means that he is just a bad artisan instead of a silence. Subverter Considering that none of the movies I've seen so far have particularly impressed me, I do not really care what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
