W. Somerset Maugham Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a classic of the English language. If so, much must have been missing in the movie version here. The attraction of Phillip (Leslie Howard) to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the stage look like the recount after the breakup of a relationship from the point of view of man. Being a family lawyer I have heard many of those accounts; Man represents himself as noble and always correct, and woman is a hell that has no other purpose than to exploit man. <br /> <br /> In fact, unless one is willing to laugh at the filmmaker's social assumptions, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even pleases Mildred when he brings an undetermined paternity baby, but the high point occurs when Phillip allows Mildred, enraged and now of dubious sanity, to run her apartment free, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not happen here. In fact, at the end of the film, it is very similar to the character of Baby Jane, which he would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I notice that Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. He tells me that Phillip longs for the respectability of the middle class. Someone like that could not run away from a woman with a Cockney accent course fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more credible if he had been younger, and had the scruffy looks that revealed the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status, such as an English Raskolnikov. And I balanced that by allowing Mildred a minimum of charm.
