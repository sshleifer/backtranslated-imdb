Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after the death of her husband, so she is dedicated to the ganja to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the always reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint, but the material is very thin. Actually, there is a scene in which Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" (a toke) and he believes that she is asking for sex and is uncomfortable. Yes, it's humor for a nun to get bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what she wants to be: the dazzling cinematography and the majestic rhythm evoke the memories of Ryan's Daughter, while the cheerful caprice of the country people could be taken out of any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It speeds up after the first hour, but by then it's too clich√© to worry. The climax manages to be unpredictable only with the introduction of the most shameless Deux ex Machina I have seen.
