James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental illness center" for a medical residency assignment with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realizes that many inmates are being killed by 'The Ripper', who takes their souls to hell, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when Helen's character, James Bishop's blond fiancé arrives at the asylum, that it's almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a script. And what about James's return to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And the cast, made up of actors and actresses of ham? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this movie: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is certainly all of them. I watched this movie on cable TV, and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money on that garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the plot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Demônio '(` Devil')
