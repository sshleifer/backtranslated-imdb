This 1973 TV remake of Billy Wilder's classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes an excellent Barton Keyes. It's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but it's the only reason to see this. The only improvement of this remake on the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, the stepdaughter of the fatal woman, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's all for the good. <br /> <br /> Bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent way: if you saw the movie with the sound muted, you would hardly have the impression that something especially interesting was happening. Due to modern bad taste, the film should be in color instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste of the 1970s, all sets are annoying and unpleasant. Walter Neff's expensive apartment, in particular, is horrible. <br /> <br /> The modern environment hurts in many ways. Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more like a contraption. The men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair while posing as Mr Dietrichson, with white hair. The bereaved women stopped using veils, which rob Samantha Eggar of a support that Barbara Stanwyck used splendidly in a key scene. (Interestingly, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she needed them). <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco retains much of the screenplay of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler the same. But it makes many small and inexplicable changes in the dialogue that leave the script slightly flabby, where it was once lean and muscular. Surprisingly, the famous jokes of the police and motorcycles are gone, but look carefully and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be the culprit. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we have Samantha Eggar, who appears as a villain of "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame Eggar? With a director who just seems to be interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself get it right?
