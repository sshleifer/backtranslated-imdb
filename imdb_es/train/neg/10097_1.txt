I went through BB and picked up 4 zombie movies to watch the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the performance will be lower than the average and the sets will be suspect. So I'm not expecting much. But at least I should have a story. The stories cost nothing except time ... apparently, they did not have time either. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie and they all looked like new wave prostitutes. The zombie image on the cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to see him and he had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> The execution time is only 81 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only listen to the movie since I was on the computer in another room), it sounded like a porn zombie ... if you think about it, it sounds a bit serious ... but it was not like that. even that good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> It ended up being a free rental and I still feel cheated. I rated it with 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
