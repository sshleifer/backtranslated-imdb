After being a big fan of the ten-minute TV episodes of "Stella Street," I waited for this movie with enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately, I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how almost all the gags and a liner were taken directly from the TV episodes, and were presented with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had said them once, and did not bother to repeat them. I bought my copy on DVD and I felt cheated by having separated my earned money to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The plot of the film begins with Stella Street (a normal English Street, in Surrey), which is gradually being populated by "some of the most famous people on the stage and the screen of the last forty years ", including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up being scammed by a local swindler, and they are forced to live as vagabonds and ordinary working class people. There are some nice moments, but in general, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it quite boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In episodes of the TV, all the characters are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. His imitations were not fun, and he felt as if his characters were included in the story just to give him something to do. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you can find This movie entertains. But if you were a fan, I think you can walk away feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
