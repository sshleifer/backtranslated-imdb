I can not believe that someone thought there was something original or interesting in this movie. I am a fan of science fiction as much as the next kid, and I can even enjoy old movies with ridiculous premises provided they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my brilliant review by Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could have better explained exactly why he should, for a second, take seriously the basic idea behind this movie . The problem is not that the producers had a low budget, it is that they did not care. <br /> <br /> Now, to publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose enthusiastic reviews appear in the box: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br / > <br /> Guardian of the San Francisco Bay <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read these last two.) Still, his film Revise credibility has gone through the floor, but I know that if any Once I make a film with a handheld camera, a cheesy plot and stupid effects, I'll show it to these journalists and I'll remind them of what they said about Conceiving Ada.
