Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his bossy fiancee, Kate (Eva Longoria) are reviewing the last-minute arrangements for their reception. It's the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, paying attention to catering companies about their demands for food presentation. But, horror of the horrors, the ice sculpture "angel", ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In a later fight with the sculptor, the heavy maid of "ice" falls on Kate and sends her to the afterlife. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted her to start dating other ladies and move on. However, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) is interested in Henry herself, to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create chaos for Ashley, since she has no intention of letting another woman take her hands on Henry. Can something be done to return Kate to heaven forever? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst that this fan has ever seen. No, it's not the cast, since they're trying to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and fun as the dominant fianc√© and Bell has an unconventional style and a humor that is also contagious. Biggs, a fun actor, too, is totally lost. As for Rudd, a very talented performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), he tries his best and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. Its charm, appearance and ease of use make the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a meaningless script and a terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you're a fan of romantic comedy, think long before disbursing money for it. Even if the free tickets fall into your lap, keep in mind that this movie is a near-death experience for those who love the cinema of love and laughter.
