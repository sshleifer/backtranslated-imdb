Probably, this is the worst movie ever made. It's just that Roger Corman's name is associated with her. I could have understood it in its early years when I had lower budgets, but today there are no excuses to give birth to this! I am a pervert of the movie "B" and, from the point of view of some people, all the films that I love are set aside by the "usual spectators", but I trust this. Vampire club is the first on my list of the best of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the music is out of place, the sound effects are simply not effective and, finally, Savage does not seem to know he's in a vampire movie. The witch is very bad. Because he had a "not so bad" career about everyone. Let me know if I am too hard with this cause because when I do not like a movie, I tend to forget that it is good.
