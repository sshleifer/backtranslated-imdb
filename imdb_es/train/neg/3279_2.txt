Oh, my God ... There are so many other movies that I want to see out there ... I stayed with my nephew during the weekend and this is what I wanted. Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used it to see this program when I was in college ... it was absurd, something fun and something action oriented. The show had a good heart though ... and the characters were cute; nobody was killed or hurt ... it was like a caricature that came to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This does not work As others have said, there is simply no cohesive story and the performances are strange ... almost annoying, they are definitely not faithful to the original characters ... everything is like a Mad TV drama and lasts more than 100 minutes. ! This was one of the few times that I have EMBARRATED watching a movie. What were you thinking? The best I can say, must have been for the marketing of products, toys, etc. All I can say is that this death must be a quick death. It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard look like a Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remaining remake on television is Gilligan's Island ... Good luck!
