This time we have a psycho toy maker named "Joe Petto" (understood?) Who makes living and evil toys that kill people. He persecutes the family that has the bad luck of simply living in the same house where he and his robot robot "Pino" (again, do you understand?) They used to live. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully [probably the last one] in this semiserie, this and the previous one look like soft core porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It is something like a low-income hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home movies. Supposedly in 2000 they started doing a sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can only hope it stays that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star out of **** <br /> <br />
