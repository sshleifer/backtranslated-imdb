There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the movie could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The film in general is already (fortunately) short, but this could have been compensated by paying a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how is it that a reference to "The Wiz" was lost in that?) And working its secondary argument to Poco more closely in the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but it needed some reworking. <br /> <br /> Second, I could have done it without the raw humor. The original also had something that could have happened without him, but at least there was almost an idea of ​​the last moment: flatulence and urination abound here. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little too self-conscious. The original series had it pretty good, like the first movie, but here it's too much, too much. Brendan Fraser's jokes were a bit exaggerated (and why is not the "new Ursula" mentioned?). Other gags with the narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also surpass common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, more attention could have been paid to the work of CGI. In the first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not a true elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out as a sore thumb. Ideally, special effects should simply tell the story if they are good or bad, and at least they are successful in that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> Everything said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison; he even managed to give George some personal depth, which should have been a major fault in a Jay Ward-inspired movie, but he was not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me because it was even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were pretty standard, and did not stand out in my mind either good or bad.
