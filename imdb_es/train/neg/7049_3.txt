The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without waves. For the spectators who love surfing, this movie will be a big disappointment, since the total number of minutes of surf images strives to reach three. <br /> <br /> History is a part of the life of stranded surfers who do not expect the perfect Wave, but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is a super surfer who is aging and is flirting with a commitment to his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find adult happiness with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends introduce themselves and convince him to go to the beach in search of monstrous waves in the Patio de Buesos. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the film, so most of the story dissipates in a meandering succession of disconnected beach events. <br /> <br /> The acting is mainly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has some comedic moments, but for the most part his performance was mundane. Ewan McGregor was decent as the wild man who trafficked drugs, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the group. Probably, the funniest performance was delivered by Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his corpulent body into a gag of continuous vision. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character really did not have enough courage for her to show much acting ability. <br /> <br /> There really is not much here to comment on. I rated it with a 3/10. It is a real nuisance on the beach.
