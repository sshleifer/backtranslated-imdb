The opening scene 'explains' why Hurt is later 'immune' to 'Man contaminated'. Too bad it does not explain anything else: How did you get what you 'caught' / what was / why it works so fast? Then we went to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the first game in the past or the future? It turns out that it's the past, of course, but for a minute it seems to be the nd of the movie that moved to the beginning. I'm sorry, I should have paid more attention, huh? Or maybe it's just wrong. Then, much confusion about the different jobs he has had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died because of the original experiment they did to him. Hahaha Then private and private industry came together to poison one of their best players to see the effects? He must have been one of the best men, he's a friend of the chemical company's council, for God's sake. Then there is the substance itself: Technically it is a poison, but mutates in immune "carriers", so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there is the protocol h a z m a t: they jump into a situation with no idea of ​​what is in store or how to prepare for it. Did not the producers have enough money to show proper washing after the crew had just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking that Hurt was going to die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would turn out to be the closest, after all.
