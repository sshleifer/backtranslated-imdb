I recently saw this again and there is another shorter version in 1999. I have the feeling that they are the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no short pikachu is all I have. can reach So, why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy was pretty boring. It sounded like she was almost asleep, without any expression with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> This was nice enough, but there was not much at all. <br /> <br /> A collector (who after Lugia does not have a plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> The following pokemon movies are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, with no. 8 almost here.
