A movie without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double cross him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the wife of the dead man and, without her knowing that he is the murderer, he moves in with her. Then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then, in a kind of heroism WALKING TALL, he takes revenge on the gangsters who crossed him. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take on commission murder, the lazy loses all sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We can not accept any kindness in him and, as a result, the rest has no moral center. We just can not worry about that kind of person. And the wife (very well played by Kari Wuhrer, the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED KAKE), a high-class woman who runs a mission for the homeless, also loses a little sympathy by jumping straight into bed with the homeless tramp (in spite of her, obviously weakened after the death of her husband). And, when she discovers that he is the boy? What she does? She encloses him inside her house (as if ALL the houses had locks that you can not open from the INTERIOR) with her and proceeds to reprimand him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is fantastic in a role as a stocky thug. Director Stuart Gordon did much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
