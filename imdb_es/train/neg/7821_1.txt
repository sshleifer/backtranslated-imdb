Did the filmmakers even preview this before they released it? The script jumps from one place to another without giving many explanations. The beginning does not clarify whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with the beginnings of Superman on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie, but it does not really alert the viewer to this. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is presented as a potential demolition house, a stalker and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes him an interesting hero. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him. I'm seriously waiting for an SNL sketch where Superman appears in Maury Povich and Maury says: "The results are in - in the case of the boy, Superman, you are the father". In short, it's okay, acting this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but the script HORRIBLE. The movie is basically unappealable.
