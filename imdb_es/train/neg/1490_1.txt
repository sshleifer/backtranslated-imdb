First, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and it's just horrible. This movie has all the clich√©s of terror movements in the imagination, and all are misinterpreted. The teen couple too sexed. The comical (not) horny sportsman. The cool brat chick. The local color type spooky. The couple of parents. The virginal girl who amazingly never dies in these movies. The dialogue is painfully horrible and presents itself with the depth of a children's pool. It's almost as if you're wishing everyone died before. A while ago I saw the cut of this movie, but somehow, this only got worse. Of course, the funniest thing here is the ghoul who tries to eat Jameson's implants, but that does not qualify even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
