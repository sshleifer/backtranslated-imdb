I did not expect much from this television movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for the dwarf limbo of any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still, he managed to disappoint, and it was not a good or bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene was from memory, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and TV shows related to big business conspiracies in the script, leaned back and said: "My work is fact". It is all clich√©, all predictable and, what is worse, the actors are forced to appear to be taking it seriously (even when the plot developments are ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let someone know that sitting through "Fatal Error" is just that.
