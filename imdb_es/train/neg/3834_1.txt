I watched this movie after having enjoyed Gregory's Girl so many years ago. This was silly. The plot was vaguely unpleasant with the teacher and his friend, perverted among the girls of 14 to 15 years in very short skirts. Previous commentators seem to think that this does not matter, but I found it quite unpleasant. If you have children in school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher is looking forward to his students. We were surprised that the censor let that happen. Apart from that, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair tries too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, a bit crazy and out of place. Why anyone would want to covet him in this performance is incredible. This movie failed in every way for me. Terrible. Please do not waste your time watching it. Life is too short
