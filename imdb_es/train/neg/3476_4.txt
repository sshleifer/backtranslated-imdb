I liked it, I really did it. Please, do not think I'm an idiot, but I must admit that I enjoyed this movie. I was hoping it was bullshit, it was crap, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch a fucking movie where you do not have to concentrate too much, right? I did not expect any hidden or moral meaning, and there was none, but that does not matter because I only observed it for entertainment and it entertained me. Movies like this are the reason why the Ben Stillers (with the excuse that "there's something about Mary") and the Vince Vaughns (as their last name is spelled, they did not bother to check) have a job. a fucking movie as long as you do not expect too much from her, and I, for example, will take a position, run, run, but not drive because I do not have a car, Blockbuster Video, or even Options, and rent a lot of these humor films for the bathroom and stay in one night watching them Good morning for you reader Q. If you do not say that this comment helped you, then I do not like you, if you say it helped, then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
