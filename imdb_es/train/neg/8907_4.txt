Yesterday I rented this on a DVD and I did not realize that it was a type of "character study" movie, so it cost me to watch an hour before pressing the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a study of theme characters, I just could not get into this movie at all. Maybe it was my mood to want to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but leaving that aside, I did everything possible to keep going to finish looking, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the overall combination did not come together to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was that the sergeant's gun was stolen, he rushed to buy another and painted it black so that it appeared as a police matter. I think this movie should have been titled "Who stole the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well done, but when I put them together, once again I felt that they were stealing me for something cohesive to let me see. <br /> <br /> As I did not finish seeing it, I would say that there is a merit in the rental of this movie. .. perhaps. For me, it was a waste of time and a good visual effort. I'll leave it to you to try it, but it's not one I highly recommend.
