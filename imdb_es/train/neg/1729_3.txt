... and how they got you out of your head! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films of the 70s made without actors of any note, a shameful script, a regrettable address and a tireless desire to fuse "horror" with light comedy. This film features a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur below Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and a claymation water dinosaur begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants that surround Crater Lake. The whole thing is in charge of Steve, our local sheriff. Much of the film, when it does not show the puddles of blood left over from what we imagine must have been the beast's dinner, is dedicated to following the clumsy noise of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a rental place boats. They try to be so funny that we have lines like, looking at a business poster, Mitch says to Arnie: "You spelled it wrong, it's spelled B-A-T-E." Laughter was rather scarce here. Then we see that they get drunk together and we imagine that a tree trunk is the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy, be careful! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is funny in a bad way. And at least, the lake is beautiful.
