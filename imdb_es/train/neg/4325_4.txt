The second in the holiday series is easily the least enjoyed, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> The insipid, under the belt humor that worked so well the first time, is practically nonexistent here. That failure is surely in the director Hackerling, who obviously is not a director as good as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of scattered decent lines. <br /> <br /> The cast does what it can; Chevy Chase injects some kind of life in the process, but it just is not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unfortunate Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments do not develop to their full potential and leave the viewer for the most part aggravated. All representations of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally nothing funny (like the way Englishmen are SOOO educated). <br /> <br /> Apart from some scenes, there is almost no laughter in sight and the ending turns one into a complete slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like me), the movie can be seen, but no more than that.
