This movie is really horrible, the candy that plays Ben can make up for everything that is wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The writer / director / producer / main actor, etc. probably had a good idea to create a film that deals with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and almost any other problem that affects a gay man of these times, but try to include all the themes in a film so ill-conceived yes. Little justice for any of these causes. <br /> <br /> The script is poor, the cast is very common, but the dialogue and the acting are simply regrettable. The brother who hates the homo is played by the actor who camps the most and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I've seen more passion in a corn flakes ad). The acting is rigid and the dialogue forced (a scene in which the brother feeds the detective with his lines was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see that the creator of this train crash has not done so. I pushed any other garbage into the distribution, and if he is thinking of doing it, I have a piece of advice: DO NOT DO IT.
