As is often the case, movies about characters who hate themselves are not usually a good drama. 'Download Nancy' is no exception. Supposedly, it is based on a true story about a woman who was killed at the request of someone she knows online. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello), who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game that his company has successfully marketed in several bars and restaurants. Unlike most human beings, Albert has virtually no positive attributes (except for his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a grim and severe expression on his face. He does not feel sympathy for his wife with all his emotional problems and resorts to condescending prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, he punishes her by masturbating in his presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is a single note as a character. Not only did she have a 15-year loveless marriage, she was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up (fortunately there are no flashbacks to that story in the movie). Her self-deprecation takes the form of self-mutilation and, as a result, she is forced to receive therapy. However, you have so much contempt for your therapist that you can not move forward. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she gets in touch with Louis through the Internet. He is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money while inflicting enormous amounts of pain. It is revealed that Louis has two children, but he no longer sees them (the mother of the children no longer wants to have anything to do with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to first have painful intercourse with Louis and then have her kill her. . There is a particularly unpleasant scene in which Louis has sex with Nancy while cutting her vaginal area with a piece of broken glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis visits Albert, who ties him up and hits him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a double plan to go see Albert: 1) reprimanded him for the treatment he gave Nancy and 2) enjoyed the beating he received. It takes a while before Louis reveals Nancy's fate first, forcing Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative for someone to care for him in the future. Nancy's fate, of course, is that Louis finally strangled her to death (but first showed some hesitation by making it clear that she had some 'feelings' for her). We soon learned that Louis is imprisoned for life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What exactly are we going to remove from a movie like Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to feel sorry for the victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the movie? Is sympathy justified by Nancy? I do not think so. The writers of the film create a man of straw in the character of Albert, someone who is so isolated from his emotions that he is responsible for the decline of Nancy. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I do not think so. They have the repulsive Louis, a man who makes a living inflicting pain, approaches and berates Albert for neglecting Nancy. Also, his expressions of love for Nancy (before he dies) are supposed to show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter if the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie. The different characters in the movie. They are so determined to excite their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence, that Download Nancy is nothing more than an exercise in bad taste and soft pornography.
