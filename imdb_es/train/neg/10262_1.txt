['Now, I approached this just out of curiosity and I had to keep looking, in the same way that you see a car accident ... <br /><br /> I appreciate the fact that it is a parody, but that should not stop me from criticizing the appalling direction, the acting and the dialogue. Seriously, it&#39;s rated as one of the poorest movies I&#39;ve seen, it was more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one in that ... <br /><br /> Okay, some criticism (1) when the doctor had a heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attacking it, so we assume it is a heart attack), the army throws missiles, rockets and bullets at the monster. - that was a few meters from the doctor - however, the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the attack of the army from about 100 yards away, and we see that he is using a flamethrower - wow, those things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the teacher, the soldiers run to the classroom and shoot at the ceiling; the monster drops the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) The monster looks like something out of Power Rangers! (5) There is a scene in which the five &quot;good guys&quot; (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the child) are shocked and we have reactions (hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general simply flees, again and again (7) the general refuses to test the electricity and did not want to listen (8) the performance is horrible (9) Did I mention the monster in the rubber suit? (10) that horrible music of God, without stopping!']
