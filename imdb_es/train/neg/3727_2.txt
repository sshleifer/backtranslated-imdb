Written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by some agent of exploitation, this is boring and difficult to see. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie in history, but at least it sucks like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually has a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only for unconditional supporters and unconditional Dispensationalists. I am none. <br /> <br /> Do not you believe me? Watch it for free (even if it comes from a poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links were added mainly to reach the 10 lines of IMDb. minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
