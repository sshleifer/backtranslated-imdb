It's pretty bad when the generic synopsis of the movie has more information than the movie itself. The "plot summary" of a long paragraph written on the movie page has details that I could not deduce when viewing the actual movie. I found myself constantly making a backup to see what details I had just overlooked, what could tell me what was going on (bleep). Unfortunately, this movie does not take into account the monstrous pieces of the story, if one could say that it is a story. It's as if they were trying to fool us into thinking we had some kind of movie here, filming enough to make it look like a story and leaving the rest to our imagination. Breaking news to creators: I paid to see you make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine plots and stories for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I never paid enough attention to to put the name to my face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I've seen for a main character in any movie, A or B. I thought well, maybe she really did not want the role, just received a considerable offer for a movie she did not have. inside? Incorrect. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, do not make a reservation as a protagonist if you can not act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, someone here mentioned the white / Latino theme - yes, I hate to say it, but this movie is presented as an act of revenge against white men of college age who wear baseball caps. That is what happens when there is nothing in the movie that attracts the viewer to the Latin characters. Adrian's character seems an arrogant imbecile who is no better than the antagonist of the story. As for the Mayan character, he did not look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was made.
