I read this work by Thornton Wilder last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation on the screen. Let me tell you that it is not a great play, it is easily overcome, but it deserves a much better chance. The performance was missing, the stage, honest for God, seemed to have been designed with cardboard by a group of three-year-old children. As if it could not get worse, the quality of the sound is terrible ... there is a 'buzz' that numbs the mind every time an actor speaks ... and I could not help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is nonexistent . All the actors seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is black and white, which would be fine, but it highlights the flavor of cheese even more. In any case, I think that if you are going to make a point of seeing this movie, something that I do not really recommend, then do not write down your hopes. The work, as unconditional as it may be, is probably better.
