When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought I should have left the children's section. It's very funny and, at times, humorous, and it's actually a good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must point out that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein's part, and his performance is extraordinary, but that is the only exception. This movie seems a bit forced, the direction lacks substance, and oh yes ... the music is ridiculously horrible, it did not put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting an intelligent and well-crafted comedy / romance story, then this can be entertaining, as I said ... it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a welcome relief from Tim Robbins' boring and almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflictive movie, but while it is not taken seriously, this can be a good movie.
