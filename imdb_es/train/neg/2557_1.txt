Actually I like asylum movies. I've gotten used to seeing as many as possible. Even the scams they have done have been great, like EXORCISM AND WHEN A MURDERER CALLS. This is just lame. I can not believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE have also made this movie. It's not even ridiculously bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way, are pretty bad). This is bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or special effects in an Asylum movie, but this movie takes itself too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES IN A TRAIN will be better. Now that is a movie that I can not wait to see.
