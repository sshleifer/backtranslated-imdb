It's been a long time since I saw this comedy, and I had forgotten how stupid it is. I'll place this easily in the lowest two or three of Elvis Presley's worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, an Indian mongrel bull rider who returns to his home in Arizona and the destroyed hut where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers any substance, comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family cattle, but they lack a bull. Elvis sings only a few worthless songs, and is chased by a crazy girl and her armed mother. This is just a real mess, and the ruined environment practically stinks of manure and does not make it much easier. The only thing that baffles me, however, is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the movie. It's hard to believe, considering that he got so upset about getting stuck doing so many mediocre movies.
