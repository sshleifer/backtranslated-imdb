This is a typical example of technically highly qualified video / commercial video directors trying to make their first full length movie. On the one hand, the images, the camera, the lighting, the CGI and even the sound are very polished and have a really "expensive" appearance. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential, to the point where even the best performance can not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is not a bad plot but just a plot. <br /> <br /> Then 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?" However, in none of the cases, any of the characters or the public is provided with the slightest indication of response. In most other dialogues, one has the feeling that there was never any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise an argument that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good if her character as an autistic girl did not allow her to give these tragically horrible lines of dialogue that the other actors had to deal with. That way, he could only show his talent for acting, which the rest of the cast could not even get close to. I mean there is not a single actor in the world who can compensate for a dialogue like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: This is real, huh? Emily: enough. Ben: A massive psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not for you, not for anyone. Emily: Not for you either. Ben: No <br /> <br /> It got my skin crawling. But not for horror, more for the horrible intent. At times I felt embarrassed by the actors who added this to their vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for the excellent technical work.
