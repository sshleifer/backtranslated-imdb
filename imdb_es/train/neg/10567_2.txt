I thought that this movie seemed like a case study about how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I am a filmmaker, I give it a 2 for coherence. <br /> <br /> The problems are maintained from the beginning to the end, since the plot is extremely predictable using fragments of most, if not all, of the previous successful war stories. . The computer-generated graphics were too similar to watching a video game in points and the director did not seem to try to add a realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what I had to work with, but I did not find that information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project pushed the limits of a low-budget film too much as a result of a production that drags the viewer along with the story without his imagination being compromised. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
