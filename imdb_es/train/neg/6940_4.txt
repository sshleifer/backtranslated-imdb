When you have two towers of interpreters armed against each other, the least you can expect is the excellent camaraderie and that is the case in this film in which we have a 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, a 34-year-old Tabu. I waited! In fact, that is all there is in the name of the plot, therefore, instead of "cheeni", it is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman become the inaugural effort of the Writer-Director R. Balki . <br /> <br /> Trust the two main actors to tear down the house with its wise cracks and bittersweet moments when love happened in this unconventional couple, and that's all you find in the slow but refreshing first half. The places of London captured in the rainy season are captivating. At the end of the first half, the romance was completed and the mission was fulfilled. There is not much left to say. Therefore, in the second half, a strange opposition is presented in the form of a father as a girl, to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how he surrenders. The result, the second half is dry, flat and without energy. There is a secondary plot with a girl who is dying of cancer and does not have much impact. However, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performances.
