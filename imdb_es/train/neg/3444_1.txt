This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. Of the plot, despite the shots, the "special effects", the performance, did I mention the plot? Everything in it stunk! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what it means to "do too much" and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do; This was supposed to be one of those movies that you can not really tell what the hell is going on until the end. You feel fascinated, without knowing who is dead and who is alive, who killed who and why, and when you think you have hit the timeline, you discover that you are wrong and the movie ends, leaving you with your mouth open during the next 5 minutes. ! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, yes, Olga? The scriptwriter, director, producer, scriptwriter, pitcher, production designer, art director, costume designer and also a double for one of the characters are some scenes ... this is basically a film of a woman and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions", you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, this may come as a surprise, but "this time" Olga made this great moment, jumping from scene to scene, from dreams to reality. ... but wait! this was all a dream after all ... or was it ??? The image fades and I realized that none of this had happened, the girl was alone in the boat ... there really was no boat ... no need to wait! There's the ship again, and the boys! They are alive! Thank God! No, they're calling to join the cruise ... but then, the ship disappears, so maybe they're dead after all? or maybe they were never alive to start with ??? <br /> <br /> If you understood what I just said you might like this movie, otherwise, it's a boring job and the only reason I wrote all this shit. is to find out how the hell this movie can end ... <br /> <br /> Do not look at this if you value the time, every time 90 minutes are a waste in this case ...
