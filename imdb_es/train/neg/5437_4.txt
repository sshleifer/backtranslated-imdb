Based on Michael Chabon's novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a famous mobster who spends his last teenage summer wandering with two friends. The year is 1983, and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Totally opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually designed with painful attempts to create a beautiful indie fashion movie, the whole movie feels like the director's, whose previous effort was fun if Dodgeball was a simple commercial, is desperately looking for an indie credibility when framing aspects of other independent films , but spray it with stars like Mena. Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like many of the premieres this year at Sundance, it felt like it was a vanity project sponsored by a secret studio to help the director win some independent credibility points: he failed in that regard and as a movie by right own.
