This is one of the dumbest movies I've seen. It starts almost any kind of suspense movie and manages to make a mess of them all. <br /> <br /> There is not a single line or good character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was a last-minute idea and in terms of acting, there's nothing good to say, so I will not say anything. Honestly I can not understand how this kind of nonsense is actually produced and released. Someone somewhere that does not think at some point: 'Oh, my God, this really sucks' and I call it a day. It's a shit like this that makes people download illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you have not wasted your time or your money. Do not waste your time, this is painful.
