Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come alive in their skillful hands. Even his occasional failure (Six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth seeing. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a very original plot (the man leaves the superhero, the superhero gets a revenge driven by the superpower) and turns it into something nice. "Bride" is an exercise in futility. The pony diagram of a single trick is long on the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The movie can not decide if it's going to be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film with the flip-flops between both, without either of the two aspects being very well done. Uma Thurman is the best, as usual, and Luke Wilson also fulfills his role, although his weaker antics tire quickly. What is even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very lit Uma hits a header through a wall), we see a scandalous and scandalous work by Reitman that practically screams to get out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, disappears as fast as the superhero whose films disappoint in almost every way.
