*** THIS CONTAINS MANY, MANY SPOILERS, NOT THAT MATTER, SINCE EVERYTHING IS SO PATENTLY OBVIOUS *** <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, where do I start? Well, here, this is the first time I come home after a movie and I say: "I have to appear in IMDb and write a critique of this NOW, it is my civic duty". Such is the evilness of this movie. <br /> <br /> * start the digression * But let me say one thing before I begin. I'm not from Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, where smart people live without rich dads and trust funds). , which should place me squarely in the census group of comic book movies and nerd-who-would-obsessively-love him, and I still hated this movie ...). My viewing preference is for the high-level cinematographic work that includes Die Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for lost lives, but we would not have been subjected to that pile of hair from a movie. And the only and only reason why I'm going to see a presumed French art film is if there is a young Emmanuelle Beart and frequently undressed. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of his precious ten years here at IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as superficial as they come, so I'm not criticizing this movie because I'm looking for a standard of cinematic excellence, because Elektra stinks like a dead three-week goat. * end of digression * <br /> <br /> Ok, there is so much evil here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the convincing reasons why a man would want to see this movie is to see a lot of JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted it). I think between this and "Finding Nemo", the latter was the sexiest movie. Do you know the red outfit you're advertising in every damn ad you see? You see it in it TWICE, once at the beginning, once at the end. Journal. In the rest, she basically resembles what Morrissey would look like if he were a woman: a lot of pots and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expression that JGar shows in his performance, which ranges from "pouting" to "pouting and crying". Oh, my God, you'd think she was forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Um, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAD CHILDREN / GAL: They show approximately the same range of expression and acting ability that you would expect from a slightly ripe grapefruit. At least next to the JGar performance, it does not stand out too much. The role of a guy is to stand there and be huge, the other is to stand there and take things out of him, and the role of the woman is to stand there and breathe and / or kiss people. They manage to pull off these incredible feats. The main villain has the most difficult role of all: he must SIMULTANEOUSLY a) appear angry and b) look Asian. He does a good job in this. I think there was a fifth bad boy / girl, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie in self-defense. <br /> <br /> READY! This movie has as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's put it this way, my wife, who has only been in the United States for half a year and speaks little English, whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's notebook, and I swear to God that I am. not inventing this: "She goes home to kill a girl, and my father too." And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife is not stupid, but Mensa is not courting her for her gifts, and she has not had any exposure to the reckless or the comic book genre. And she solved it in .00015 seconds without insults or previous information. Such is the evident evidence of this film. <br /> <br /> RARELY BEFORE THE STUPIDITY VISION! OK, so there's a great guy in the movie. You can take a shotgun bunker and brush the shot as if it were a fluff, and you can take a stab stab of Electra in the chest and simply bend the metal (or melt it, or something like that, more defenses, thank God). But JG jumps on his head, and he explodes? A noggin of Achilles? IN AGREEMENT! Such is the stupidity that numbs this movie. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you have to intentionally cut your own tires to avoid going to see this movie, DO IT. And if Armageddon is coming, please, let it be before it comes out on DVD.
