The genre of suspense films really immerses in this. The big problem is impunity. I realize that it is necessary to create difficult situations that cause suspense and the tense feeling of what will happen next, but this movie was very predictable and is not credible. I find that the more I see these kinds of movies, the more I'm continually saying things to the actors to get them away from danger. Continuously making bad decisions just limit yourself to being just stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I could have enjoyed it a little. Having said that, it is better to stay away from this.
