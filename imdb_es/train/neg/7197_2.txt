IN AGREEMENT. I think the television show is pretty cute and always has some kind of lesson involved. Then, when my children decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to follow the trail. I wish I had stayed at home and watched the TV show instead. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is almost nonexistent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and, worst of all, Gadget does not offer any kind of lesson. It seems that Disney took all the things that make Inspector Gadget work on television and threw them all. To be fair, my youngest son (8 years old) liked the movie, but the oldest (10 years old) left thinking it was silly (he was too old for youthful humor but too young for adult humor). br /> <br /> In general, I like Disney movies, but this one fails for a mile. It is fine for a very narrow age group (for example, from 7 to 9 years old), but it should not be lost for anyone else.
