Stupid, nonsense, nonsense about a jet set up in a matter of hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) who chase a Porsche racing car that runs on decades-old gasoline sludge, driven by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as the fugitive technologist. -the one who can make spare parts of McGyver in a radio receiver that can capture all the frequencies simultaneously, and that somehow learned how to acquire and use chemical products to make explosives of great power in a perfectly peaceful society. As silly as it sounds. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven because this was only his second film.
