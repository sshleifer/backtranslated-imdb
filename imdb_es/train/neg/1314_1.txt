This is the worst piece of trash I've seen recently. There is nothing good in this movie. The plot is simply stupid, the dialogues do not make any sense, the humorous scenes never heard anything about real humor. The actors just do not play, the worse they try. The script itself is something that is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movie, the fights. They are well choreographed as one would expect from the Hong Kong boys, and they are the only reason to see the Prince of the Sun. Although I think that only fights are supposed to fill the empty space so the screenwriter does not have to bother to think about the history. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from seeing it until the end. Avoid it unless you're a fan of dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
