I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At the time when Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong, he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star in history. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could with her making this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not make big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can not act. That's why there are porn stars, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go to conventional movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a 20 year old teenager, she was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in the world. She moved to low budget movies and could not act. Where is she now? I gave her a 2 instead of a 1 just because Jenna is very good, but there are better movies than "Dream Quest" did. Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk, as much as we want you to have sex. Also, you, Jenna, would have many more fans and more money in your bank account if you had done the anal in the movie.
