For movie fans who have never heard of the book ("The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson) and have never seen Robert Wise's production of 1963 with Julie Harris, this new version will look pretty bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have done it, it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> Bad performance (what was Neeson thinking?), Stupid improvements on the computer, and an additional departure from Jackson's story, this new version. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. Still effectively scares without special effects hokey. The acting is professional and credible. <br /> <br /> For the readers of the book, the 1963 book follows it much closer.
