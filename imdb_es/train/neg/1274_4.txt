This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and the equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a bit of Falk. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you would hardly know it. I guess Reiser has the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs a suitable vehicle. He is not. Even more irritating is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then put them all at their bottom. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when he does, the screen lights up. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we are subject to an absurd, absurd and absurd road trip in which Reiser can show how cute, beautiful and so deep with psychological (bad!) Can be. For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser expected to be "like Cassavetes," there is a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk that is so ridiculously ridiculous that I was ashamed of Falk.
