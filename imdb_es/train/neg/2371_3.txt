I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. No one plays a better Freddy Krueger who does it. But, without offending, Robert, this movie was crap. The acting is terrible, the plot is very weak and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is worth seeing. Sometimes, the sequels may be better than the first, like Friday the 13th of the franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series). But this is not one of those movies. The original was good, the second was better in my opinion, the third was fine, but I have not seen the others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake as me when I see this shit.
