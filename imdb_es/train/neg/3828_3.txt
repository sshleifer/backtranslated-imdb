In 1976, the western was an exhausted genre and the creators of this film knew it clearly. However, instead of leaving the project aside and avoiding that we had to see it, they went ahead and did it anyway. Apparently, needing an interesting thread for the audience to come see the movie, they decided to do it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, why should not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of an excellent script, but the script of The Last Hard Men is simply outdated garbage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired law enforcement officer who chases a group of escaped convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). Hunting becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is abducted by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a bloodthirsty movie in which every time someone dies, it is displayed in the dark. the top detail is really tremendously disappointing, because the pair of stars sounds like a delicious possibility. There is also no sense of rhythm or urgency in the movie. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally comes, it is marred by the emphasis on evil. All in all, this could be the worst movie Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions that he hates to include in his illustrious CV.
