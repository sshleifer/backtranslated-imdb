Since this image is classified as a work of "pure entertainment" and as there are many comments on this, I would like to address something relevant to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the wild card role in this movie. Certainly, while he has been involved in the casting work, he has always been acting like a little man, an actor can change his usual clothes but can hardly change his physical appearance, and the latter can be an advantage when necessary. However, far from what I expected, I saw a very disguised image, which sought to expose different aspects of the baby's life by mistake of a forty-year-old criminal. And with a happy final ridicule. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed, some are violence, sex and criminal activities, among which the story is poorly composed and, to a certain extent, lacks common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and the life of your husband? ? In addition, the diamond is even larger than the world number 1 Cullinan! But the most unhealthy aspect is the continuous attempt to recover the little man as superman, showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is beautiful, hard and fragile; it can not be cut by any other material, it can only be conquered by the warm blood of a goat. Hence, it is no longer a diamond but pieces of debris.
