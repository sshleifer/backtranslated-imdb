Please be careful: this movie, although it's a pretty bad story, was one of the most frightening movies I've seen ... NEVER. Just remember that before settling on your sofa to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Then, officially begins with a party. Only your average party, but there's a guy there. He is very interested in Kate ... if you know what I am saying. Memorize your face; It will help later. <br /> <br /> So, anyway, Kate goes to find George Clooney (did not I say that the plot was bad?) and takes the tube. That's the London Underground in the middle of the night, but she's that stupid. So the schedule says that the next and last train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, the silly party girl, decides she can take a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she loses the train and is locked in the London Underground. Single. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie continues from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I will not mention, are cut and cut and, finally, amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In summary, it is a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in women of anguish type and sick psycho, rare. Or, as the case may be, Creep. <br /> <br /> I'd say you try it if you like Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but, for the rest of us, Scream with satisfies The horror needs a lot of thanks.
