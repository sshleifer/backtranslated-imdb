I know that in this episode there are other things besides what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; For example, after they gave us a very negative opinion of Jin when he saw Sun's flashbacks in "House of the Rising Sun", we can see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is one element in this story that made me feel so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly damped the enjoyment of the whole episode. Before now, in the scene in which Jin appeared with blood on his hands and his shirt, it had been suggested that Sun's father was someone who was getting rich through murky and illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mafia boss, even; Mobs operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that Sun's father is actually the boss (or a senior executive) of a Korean auto company, and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official (who actually was to be killed) in his name. <br /> <br /> I may be especially worried about this because I work in the auto industry, but I would say that it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing happens in Korea; that big companies like Hyundai or Kia (which should be the model for this fictitious car company, since they are the only ones that actually exist) operate with these methods similar to those of the mafia, instead of like any normal automotive company from West. It is simply incredible to me that writers have the nerve to write something like that in history, and that there has not been a rampage in Korea for that. It feels like weird "Buy American!" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminals, unworthy of confidence, outfits of the third world.
