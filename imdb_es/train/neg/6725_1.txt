What could have been a study of attractive character and full of emotions is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is fine as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his episodes of schizophrenia take him to the street and, finally, to the row of skates. In search of a good story to improve his champion career, reporter Steve Lopez (Robert "rehabilitation" Downey) knows him and tells his story. Taking all the elements of the classic "how to get on the skates" movies, borrowing very generously from "A Beautiful Mind", taking the false "feel good" attitude from movies like "Rocky", choose the number of the sequel and you also increase a lot 1930's melodrama all that remains on the screen is a burnt shell of a movie. It is cheesy, trite, completely predictable and plays too often in our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will look at you badly. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. The performance redeems him a little, but not enough to give him more than one star. Made strictly for television movie things. It's not worth your time.
