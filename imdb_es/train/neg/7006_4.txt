Mark Hamill should have felt very embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new type of "force" to regain possession of the machine of his dreams, a bright red Vette. It seems like another sour teens movie for the first half hour and it takes a U-turn in the direction of the wrong direction. The writing and direction work is terribly done, with a few scenes that can hardly be done. You expect this to happen anyway, and you're also sniffing the scent of the hodgepodge of the late 70s. Only an ex-newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor repo movie! Her impractical but charming personality maintains her interest in good, and this is the best opportunity to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! I'm sorry, Mark! I guess the Force was not with you this time.
