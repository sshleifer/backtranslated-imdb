This can not be Mandy Schaffer's latest film. Someone, do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> The little life this may have had, the address ended, do not blame the cast, they did it well, even the youngest winemaker It was very well done, and he did not even get into the movie halfway, and please, put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such an early age., heah ... . <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, in case someone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First, the way Traci continued to appear at the right melodramatic moment, to see what he was supposed to see, and was never seen in return, was very annoying ... Hollywood: please stop giving the villains the perfect luck that ends when the climax comes in. It's silly, write better scripts so you do not you have to do it, use that lame plot device, if your script is not good enough to resist without that, then Do not do it. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen would not have fallen. It's because of that false injury trick that Traci pulled. She already had Traci typed. More wrong write / direct there. <br /> <br /> I could destroy this movie even more, but mercy forbids it. I did not really hate him as much as the others seem to have. He just did not have many reasons to be done, unless it was purely a vehicle to show off to the lovely Mandy. Oh, and for someone who did not think it was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say it was not sexy? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I do not think it's me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy", although I would also like to see her again ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I expect Mandy to make me more movies? <: - D
