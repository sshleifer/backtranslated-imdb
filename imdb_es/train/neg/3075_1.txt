Yes ... it's definitely up with some of the worst MSTifyed movies, but I've definitely seen worse. He thinks Gremlins called R. Bueno, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at a science fiction convention. Surprisingly, he was giving a lecture! It was one of those very low budget conventions, where everything goes, everyone brought something (if you want to see shit, you should have seen what some friends and I brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed a very nice guy, he was very good with my questions and comments about Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and he said he loved the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> In short, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was meant to be bad like the Attacks on Mars. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and I give it a 5, and I betray all my fellow MSTies. I'm sorry guys.
