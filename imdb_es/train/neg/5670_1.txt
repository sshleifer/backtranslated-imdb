The only reason why "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY star is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. In addition to seeing Angie Baby in a preview to "Police Woman", there is nothing more worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> THE SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINORS SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is chosen to write a book about the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling his editor and suggesting that he has stumbled upon something that has put him in mortal danger. The complete series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks through the "Norliss tapes," a set of audio tapes that the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a rich sculptor dies, but not before buying an ancient Egyptian beetle ring from a local occultist who assures him that the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discovered that the ring itself does not grant immortality. Instead, he only revives the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape from his crypt so he can run through the city draining pretty girls of all their blood. <br /> <br /> Blue-faced, yellow eyes and growling. ARRRGHHHHHHs Since the last time you saw the cartoons of "Scooby Doo," the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. Escape and, through a mutual acquaintance, contact Norliss to obtain her help to solve the mystery behind the strange reappearance of her deceased husband on her property. <br /> <br /> So this man is a vampire? No. There are no vampires in this story despite what you have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims, he gathers it. How? I do not know. We only see him attacking, never picking up. Why? To fulfill the second part of your bet for immortality. It turns out that the revived sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon called Sargoth with a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it is finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> THE FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "The Norliss Tapes" was not picked up As a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see in my synopsis, the story is an insignificant and ill-conceived disaster. Acting and dialogue do not offer better. This is not even a contender for a "So bad is good" prize. Sometimes, the bad is bad. <br /> <br /> After years of listening to clandestine rumors about the great merits of "The Norliss Tapes", I was very excited to find him on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I had not prepared for the fall. <br /> <br /> Having examined this grumpy for the first time two days ago, I can only assume that any applause I have heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on vague memories. and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply faithful followers of Dan Curtis. Either way, they have offered you deceptive criticism of "The Norliss Tapes." <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
