Summary: full moon. A creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt. Not for the meat, not for the blood (although it does not seem that he cares to bite a bit on the way), but for a companion. He is in search of a girl. Although no girl The woman. The girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, although she does not know yet). Three, well, check that, two cops (after the first scene) and an old lady bag is all that can stop him, or even know that killing and eating a lot of people around the full moon is a werewolf. This powerful werewolf in particular, Darkwolf, is approaching the girl. If he gets it, humanity is doomed. Now the police have to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, however a werewolf, who wants to rape her, and maybe kill her, but that she herself is a werewolf. And then they stopped him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one of the boys, the teenagers. Many scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot. Especially less. Well, I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is (supposedly) thin. And, unfortunately, there is little more than the girls to help the plot break. One usually resorts to two main themes. Nakedness. Check. And then the special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you could call effects. Although they are not very special. In fact, to be frank, they are very bad. The movie seems to be suffering from a lack of funds. They could not buy clothes for some of the girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between the werewolf and the human form, obviously made by computer, are really bad. You could overlook these things. But the Dark Wolf in itself is also very crude, and you can never see any murder. Only a few corpses mutilated later. And there is surprisingly little blood in a movie that should honestly be soaked in blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about the actors and the characters. Most of the time they do it well, but unfortunately there are flaws in which the characters (or actors) simply lose it. Some of these lapses could be related to the problems mentioned above. Like the poor effects, or the poor budget (?). That could explain why there are very few shots, even if the characters are armed as a small army and the target is in sight (and does not move). But hey, when you're in real danger, there's nothing that can save your life as a good person ... Unfortunately, that can not explain the times when the cop, Steve, is the only. the one who knows how to deal with the problem, the werewolf who is, runs away, the only thing he can be sure of, is that the werewolf comes for the girl, who is right next to him now, and who can not. let her have it But of course, it allowed the manufacturers to extend the end a bit more ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind seeing any of the main actors / actresses have another chance in another movie. <br /> <br /> Good. To give a small conclusion: It is not a film that I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
