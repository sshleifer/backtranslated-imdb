Beast Wars is a show that is overrated, overrated and overrated. Let's meet the characters of this nasty show whose creators must have been in acid to try to make a show like this. <br /> <br /> Cheetor- Seriously, they need to have censorship in this guy. How is it possible that they do not scare the spectators who have the same voice as the baby Taz? (At least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Action Blast- If you want a show line that sucks, get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron- A show that should go to the bathroom. The good creators of work (sarcasm) show that they are self-retarded and boring (at least the Super Mario games are better) This program had many followers who say they brought it back, but I think it was canceled for its own sake.
