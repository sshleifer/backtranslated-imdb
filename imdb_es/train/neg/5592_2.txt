It is difficult to describe this film and one wants to make an effort not to discard it too quickly because it has the feeling that this could be the perfect film for a 12-year-old girl ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a good concept : the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a touch. He has some dreamy shots and some good sketches of the boy's relationship with his single mother and his schoolmate ... a good start, you might say, but then he became a little greedy, very greedy, he tries to be a science. Fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, a fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result has just left the public feeling quite inadequate. For example, the scene in which the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke up with her kiss (Yuki Kohara), instead of being romantic, tries to be terrifying to make us laugh later ... it's a cheap trick. because it ruined all the anticipation and emotion that I was trying to build for the best half of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story on which the film is based (it is the best-known work by comic book artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for his intriguing and intricate stories.) I wonder if all the problems exist In the original story or did it happen in the adaptation? It is quite illogical even for someone who is used to the "demanding logic" of those Japanese comics, for example, how did the character of Yuki Kohara get to the hospital in an instant (when it's supposed to be a long bus ride) to escape from the character of Risa Goto in front of the television cameras right after watching her live interview on TV? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are They copied directly (very un-creative!) from other films and they all seem rather uselessly annoying, that is, the famous scene "The lion's mouth has my hand" from "The Roman Holiday". <br /> <br /> The movie tries to be everything, but t It ends up being nothing ... it stops being a fairy tale. I did not have enough jokes to be a comedy ... and, strangely, there are some scenes that even seem to be an involuntary "ghost" movie. However, one should recognize that he has managed to capture some of the feelings of the Japanese teenager. . <br /> <br /> It is upon seeing this film that I have the feeling that there may be some films that should have a warning label that says "this film can only be suitable for people under the age of 18." , I would have definitely been in the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
