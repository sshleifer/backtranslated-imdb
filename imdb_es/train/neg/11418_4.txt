Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of Georgetown graduates facing adult life situations. The story line is a messy chaos, but some scenes are really good. There is a lot of lost talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Highlights include Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Est√©vez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty nasty. Reaching adulthood is not so easy.
