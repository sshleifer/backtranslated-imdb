The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it, such as Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what you think each episode was a winner. They are the ones that qualify each individual with a 10 and can not objectively evaluate the show. Due to this, some time ago I reviewed all the original episodes of Star Trek (the good ones and the bad ones) because the ratings and the general reviews were too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I have scored many episodes 10, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. You see two people from opposite sides in a great war wandering around the whole episode. After a while, it is evident that they are the only two people left on Earth, as you learn in the really stupid conclusion and totally unconvincing. Usually, the turn at the end makes the episode great, it killed him!
