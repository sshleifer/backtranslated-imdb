I would like to say that curiosity took hold of me. If only I saw a trailer, I could tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most useless hour and forty minutes of my life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's a shame for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this child's remote-controlled racing car runs through the neighborhood and even enters this house. It is even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote control can no longer transmit a signal in those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictate otherwise; I doubt that the race car could have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence criminals possess. Why in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet an eight-year-old boy? Is the child supposed to be the smartest person in the movie instead of the professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. In addition, the leader lowers his real gun and "accidentally" takes a plastic gun; Apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. The fact that they look the same does not mean anything; There are other senses then the view. The traps are not realistic either; If any of them really worked, the criminals would be dead. However, Hollywood intends to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a really bad movie; The movie they watched will look like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, jump this for the sake of your pride. Alone at home 3 also poses a question. We all know Alex D. Linz as the protagonist of the film, but he wrote it too?
