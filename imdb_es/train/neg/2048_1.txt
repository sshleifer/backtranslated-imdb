1 is to be quite generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, although it's not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover, and we all know it! It scared me a lot. But this movie is something else. Being directed by a guy who has lived a long time and has directed many films, it seems that it was filmed on a VHS camcorder by a 10-year-old boy! History and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you have also disappointed me. After playing one of the most threatening villains in the history of cinema, have you resorted to this? However, the story and the acting could have been forgiven, if someone had taken the time to make the video look professional. There are MANY shots in video movies that do not seem, or at least they are not so obvious that they divert their attention from the movie. I can not say it's the worst movie in history, because I could not finish the whole movie, but it's certainly close.
