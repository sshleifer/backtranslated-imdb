The fact that this movie reached the rental track in Norway is strange. This movie is just horrible. This image quality is only a little better than that of a mobile phone and the plot is so bad. The main character is just annoying and the rest just sucks. Everyone affiliated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; They even saw it !? This is probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. Labeling this as a comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
