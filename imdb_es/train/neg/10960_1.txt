Oh! They do not come much worse than this horrible adaptation of the beloved novel by C. S. Lewis. While the adaptation is very faithful to the novel, the performance is simply horrible and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I have read that the budget for this miniseries was the largest that the BBC has given at the time, but surely they could have collected a little more than the $ 2 that seems to be filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know that the computer effects were not at the necessary level or even were not profitable at that time, but the man in the costume store looked horrible. It's better to cut the character out of the movie than to do that with the paper! Avoid this at all costs.
