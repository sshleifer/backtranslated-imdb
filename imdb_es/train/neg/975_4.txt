I saw the "woman on the beach" of this director and I could not understand the good ones to the excellent reviews. This movie is very similar to that, two people who are stuck in a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest for others. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to empty dialogues, to go through very little and be enchanted with subscribed characters, quite uninteresting. If you feel that you may like this movie, do not let my criticism stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I think that Tsai Ming-Liang's films are much superior. He has a pretty good actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU would like it, but I do not like it. Oh good.
