Definitely fits the period of time, since Axis & Allies played spy games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of movies, but it's certainly not the worst of the low-budget movies as described earlier in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really very good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never had bigger roles is beyond me. He played the role of perfect partner / partner and kept the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As stated, this movie was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package titled War Classics. Eight movies for eight dollars, which include other films never heard that have some decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, it's not so good. The editing and cinematography is ... worse. If you can avoid all that and you want to see the future Cisco Kid and a great companion who, unfortunately, never fulfilled his true potential, definitely, find out! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
