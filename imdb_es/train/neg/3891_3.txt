I think that my favorite part of this film, which exemplifies pure uselessness, stupidity and the madness of the proceedings, reaches the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the Sheriff, have finally cornered the Melting Man on a landing in a stairwell of an electric power plant. Note that Nelson has been searching for the MM for most of the movie, and that the GM has killed and eaten several people at this time (including his boss), and Nelson is well aware that MM is wildly insane and hungry of humans. flesh and blood <br /> <br /> So the Sheriff has his gun pointed at MM, which is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker the props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying human-shaped object we've ever had. seen And he shouts a very important question to the MEDICAL TED NELSON: "WHAT DO WE DO NOW ????" <br /> <br /> The camera approaches DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it's obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so focused on the problem of FINDING the Melting Man, that he never thought of wearing some restraint devices, a tie or straitjacket, a net, or some tranquilizer darts, or maybe a tape of The New Age of Vangelis to calm the wild beast. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panics and shoots, Melting Man goes crazy, and hilarity occurs. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been playing with the Space Shuttle program in the sub-lunar space for the past 30 years instead of returning to the Moon or Mars as everyone knows that they MUST be work I dont know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's the lousy and lazy type of writing and direction that undermines all aspects of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors really are, because the movie has a total disregard for its characters. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the procedures: there is a scene that shows the most bulky An elderly couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a forest, only to be smashed by the Fusion man This scene is a nadir in the cinema of the 70s. I can guarantee that I have never seen a more useless and irritating configuration with stranger people in all their life. And the Melting Man assault on the lady who lives in the house where they raise a horse that pisses on the walls defies all attempts to process it (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme has a scene in this scene as the Redneck husband who enters first to check the house and never goes out again). The only thing that prevents the actress from literally chewing the stage is that, as I said, her horse apparently has been urinating on it. And we are forced to watch his hysteria for at least two minutes longer than any SANE movie director would celebrate. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the director and photographer of IMM. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looked a LOT better than he does here, the idea of ​​a prominent man is not solid, but not intrusive. But no one could be as unattractive in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else comes out a little better, except for the elderly couple (and shut up, I know they were playing to laugh, but I'm not laughing) but not much. <br /> <br /> This definitely falls into the category of 'so bad you can not look out' of movie disasters. Still, I would see it again before seeing many other abortions from the 70s and 80s ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives by Night" come to mind), and MST coverage is very fun, so If you have the opportunity, look at the MST version.
