There is a reason why Jay Leno himself does not recognize this movie. It is consistently classified as one of the worst movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself does not seem to be sure how to take this film. "A movie of friends", "an action / comedy", "mystery". It seems that halfway, he gives up, and is along the road. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It's a shame they lost time and gifts making this mess of a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita, before getting involved with this, had spent years throwing their crafts on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right, acting consistently since the mid-1960s as the star of the television and cult movie classics such as "Happy Days" and the sad but affable "Mr T and Tina. " And he won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film "Midway," "The Karate Kid," and many others. Mr. Leno can be seen on television shows that date back to the mid-'70s. And he was one of the best actors in comedy clubs in America. He can be seen in countless television commercials and in major movies. It's a shame, they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
