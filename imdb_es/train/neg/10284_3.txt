Having seen men behind the Sun, I suppose I expected an evolution in style and technique to fit the larger scale of this film. I was also very interested to see someone make a fictitious account based on hard facts of what happened during this notorious Japanese atrocities, but it is not like that. This works like a film of mid-level European Nazi exploitation in the mid-70s; for example, Camp of Experimentation of the SS, etc. (maybe more like Women Deported from the Special Section, actually). Granted, it has a greater reach and more people running, but resorts to the same cheap and sad device of many unfortunate non-actors who fall to the sound of ridiculously false shots, accompanied by the occasional "blow" wrongly executed. sequence. The documentary footage, admitted as horrible, is roughly connected between scenes so trite that even these real images are robbed much of their power. Watch the Holocaust on Channel 4 (recently broadcast (is it still running?), From November 1, 2006) to watch a really disturbing documentary about the evils of war (with excellent use in context of real images) . This is the kind of treatment that deserves the horror of Nanjing, not this trash of threshed exploitation (a best-run exploitation film without the disrespectful use of archival material would have been fine, but neither is it a very good exploitation film). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
