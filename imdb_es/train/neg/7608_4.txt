I admit that I do not expect much from a Roger Corman movie. In general, I expect a lot of errant and bad scripts. However, in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger is the story of a woman (played by the spiny Beverly Garland) who assumes the position of sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is very good to herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Your first task is to close the local bar that is violating the curfew of the city. The bar owner is trying to buy a plot of land before it is bought by the (expected) railroad. However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar maid hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Because Mrs. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation. to go to Suzanne Somers "She's the sheriff" she jokes. With the exception of a couple of false steps (the apartment door that opens out from the inside, the jeep tracks and the two riders waiting on the screen to turn them around a corner), the movie It becomes quite passable as a movie. However, Corman could not resist filling his film with horse riding scenes, as he does in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno says The Gunslinger is a worthwhile horse opera.
