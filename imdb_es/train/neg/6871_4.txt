A great concept went wrong. Bad acting, worse writing ... After seeing the first two episodes, I was wondering why he reached the second season. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are fine. The special effects are simply sad. It has improved a lot in the same period of time. Where does the money go in this case? The first episode starts interesting, then goes downhill quickly - the precept of the whole show is simply silly. Now, do not get me wrong, I'm a big science fiction fan and I'm a geek, but this program just is not enough. As I said at the beginning, I am really surprised that you have reached the second season; It has been canceled much better after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.
