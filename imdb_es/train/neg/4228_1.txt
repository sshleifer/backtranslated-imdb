I can not believe how bad this piece of garbage is! I want my $ 3.99 back! The words challenge the description of this piece of junk badly done! The dubbing in no way aligns with the actor's mouth. The film looks like it was filmed with a 1970s vintage camcorder. I've filmed better movies with my cell phone camera. The blood is ridiculous because of the amazing incredible plot. The performance is what one would expect if he called all his friends on a Saturday afternoon and proceeded to be completely destroyed, then tried to put a work in his garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I would love the Zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this film that you can not see them. Avoid!
