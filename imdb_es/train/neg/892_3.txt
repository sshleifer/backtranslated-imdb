(Indicate in this revision the point where the spoilers start). My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% of deafness by tone, 70% of writing without brightness. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the synopsis of the first commentator On the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. I was surprised how, this film, in the best of cases, unfortunately affects the real city of New York by presenting a collection of people and relationships so close that they seem to be inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (this comes from someone who likes Gossip Girl). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but are included by obligation, while we can see the gears of the film so clearly, striving to "be diverse" but always falling so short. <br /> <br /> 70% that's why everything falls short. All the characters, the target and some symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts of people's concepts. Worse yet, their interactions with each other are programmed in such a way that for each vignette of the film, the audience receives a treatment of what I would say is a "joke": we get a basic idea, then a coup de grace that pretends to be an ingenious turn But even if we suspend cynicism for a moment to say, "Well, that was a surprise" ... the stories are still not so interesting, because they are also superficial. When you create stories so that your existence depends solely on the unexpected at the end, you are writing jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The movie is mainly about telling it. romantic stories It's fine. But the romance is incredible, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories show a girl and a boy who at some point share the same place and look at each other. The exchange of words, the thoughts are projected through voice-overs, but they also manage to communicate with the audience simply because one person is attracted to another. <br /> <br /> In other words, there is no seduction (in the broad sense), there is no tension, and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people who try to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other. The only story that involves a superficial "seduction" is told only so that the audience is surprised that the boy (Ethan Hawke) is tricked by the girl he is beating, which unexpectedly turns out to be a prostitute. Sure, his words when trying to capture it are interesting to listen to and we had fun as we would be if we were by his side, but this story has nothing substantial outside of "A then B". So it develops, if something like a postcard could "develop", with all the other stories too: A then B - That's right, the only point is that these occur "on the set" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch; The only Queens is the flicker of a train trip taken by a character traveling to the West Village. <br /> <br /> It is easy to choose movies that show all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation and soon. _New York, I Love You_, however, deserves to be subjected to a stricter scrutiny because of its title. We hope to see the real New Yorkers and the real New Yorkers, but instead, we have presented to us the selected piece of a demographic, their characters are from The OC, plus some others to make it look like we are paying attention. to diversity. But when we look more closely at who these characters are, the whole simulacrum becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures that the film shamefully does not represent. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets confused with two ladies like his manny (nanny) when in fact he is the father. Even though the last scene in this part was unnecessary from the point of view of the dramatic construction (it would have been much more interesting to finish it when the mother and the boyfriend / stepfather are moving away from the girl), frankly it is a bit unpleasant that The scene in which we learn for sure that the girl's father is Latina ALSO should inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, dad can not be just a boy from South America? Now that it's obviously good, is the public better prepared to accept that he had a son with a white woman from middle to upper class? Are we so naive as to require such a thing? As if a Mexican construction worker was obviously too unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. But in every conceivable configuration and twist of the plot, the direction taken shouts at the status quo, appeals to security. All these stories could have become more interesting, even if we were forced to maintain the unidimensionality of the characters that inhabit them, at least by not choosing standard and obvious stereotypes. An Asian girl who lives in Chinatown being mistreated by a disheveled old white? How about an Asian cougar chasing a white college kid instead? Once again, I am not saying that all conceit has to be changed. It's just everyone. Dammit. premise of the story. It is so trite and, therefore, do not convey anything about why one could love New York, out of the beaten track. The real way to improve the film would be to have written a script that is worth reading. <br /> <br /> I will grant the kindness of the soundtrack, the good rhythm of the film (even if what was being marked was: well, dredged), and the general feeling of many of the scenes. The movie was fine to sit on, and it would not deter anyone from doing so. However, it is revealing that the most significant tribute to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrased) "That's what I love about New York: they're all from a different place." Well, you would not know when you see this.
