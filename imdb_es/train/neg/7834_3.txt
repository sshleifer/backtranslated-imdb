Usually, I do not write reviews, but I do not understand why this has such a high rating and I wanted to warn horror lovers, since I can only assume that average TV viewers gave all those high marks. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first two episodes, but those two were so cliché, it was not even funny anymore. the same old stories that I've probably seen / read a couple of times already - live toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they're also pretty bad versions of those clichés. I would prefer for example "Chucky" and "Silent Hill" in those two episodes at any time. and do not even ask about the visual effects ... those in the first episode are fine, but those in the second ... are horrible. It seems that the project of a film student went wrong. blood ... or blood ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> may be interesting for a ten-year-old child who probably has not seen / read so many horror stories yet (although I'd prefer to recommend "beyond what you can believe" (that's what I call a Decent mystery TV show.) But for an adult horror fan it's worth nothing, I only gave it 3 points because in fact there is a beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and a good performance.
