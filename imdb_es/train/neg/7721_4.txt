The fight scenes are reproduced as in the slow motion of Jackie Chan and the attempts of ingenuity are pathetic (the worst word game by far: "Guess what, this time I heard you come"). The stars are a pair that does not match: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm, things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this film) . Note to the director: in the future, stay away from the scenes of love, especially when your main actress will not do any nudity and will have to rely a lot on a body double. (* 1/2)
