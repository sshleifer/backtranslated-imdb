The end of this movie is so terribly impossible to see and date that my whole aesthetic class of the movie laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was fine. I had some funny scenes without wanting to, but I had some really good camera shots and editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem is not with the direction, the performance or anything technical. The movie has just been destroyed in the third act. Why? Have the murders, turns, turns and characters been revolving around the NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it has just come out of nowhere may have been the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. Despite all the complaints about the planet of the Burton monkeys, the life of David Gale or Notorious, I think this is the worst end of all. What a disappointment.
