I started watching this movie with low expectations, in fact, I only noticed it because it was an adaptation of an S.K. novel (a novel I never read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was not good, but it keeps you interested. What really drags this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is too long, it does not have "nice" shots or fear, the dialogues are silly and the special effects are shit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I suppose the book should be good) without using many horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
