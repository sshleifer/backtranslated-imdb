The interesting thing is that the acting; It was not bad, it just was not enough. It was rather lame, special effects and lines were not the only culprit for this failure. Standing alone, they were not horribly bad, but together it was a tragic move. The show seemed long and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed up the movie, but it completely failed. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this disaster was attributed to special effects. Do not believe it, they were a bit cool Appleby was not the best option for this effort. Although she may have been all they had to choose with a bit of recognition from the fans. An experienced actress would have contributed something to the role, as Appleby never did. Scfi publishes some really good original films, it's a pity that this has failed so drastically.
