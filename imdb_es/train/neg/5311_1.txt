This is almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls out the carpet from underneath it, for me. The accessories are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis". It seems as if the space scenes were made in a 1950 power station, just before the demolition. The music really sucks. The performance is made of wood and ham. The characters they represent are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and blatantly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other movies. The quality of direction breeds belief. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest waste of a small budget. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
