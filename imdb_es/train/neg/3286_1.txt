I do not understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I've seen is horrible, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen the Ben Jones quote, which is a piece of "sordid" garbage, you are absolutely right. Why they took a wonderful television show, which I loved, I never missed an episode, and they own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and I screw it up, I'll never know. The television program was a family program, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the program, except the costumes. A family show has become a piece of dirty garbage, and I would not recommend anyone to go see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers of the show. The casting is terrible. They could have gotten at least one brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. All the other roles he has played are totally opposed to this role. The only role they play half decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it's still not a comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor of his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think the cast is horrible, the story is horrible, and in general it spoiled a wonderful show and turned it into a filthy and terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to go see it. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket on the season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. YOU DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
