This was a good attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to overcome it because of its low budget. The use of virtual sets almost works but in some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget, I suppose. I just wish the story and most of the performance was better. There are many parts in which you can see what they were aiming for and it would be great if they really reach those marks, but they do not. Confusing and incredible story. Bad DVD transfer too. I do not have a hard time watching a movie in a session. This I had to turn off. It was too boring. I can make slow films. But just make them attractive in some aspect. Visually, in terms of history, performance, etc. This was missing in all departments, so it never added to a fascinating experience. Maybe the filmmaker's next attempt is better.
