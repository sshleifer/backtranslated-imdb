There are so many comments in this movie, but I found them deceptive. This is a scenario of overuse and in a corner where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime for someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Chico knows a girl. The girl holds the child at gunpoint for something ridiculous. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know the exercise: the antagonist turns out to be a wild and free spirit instead of a sociopath ... Alicia Drummond with some words of wisdom and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' The role of The Breakfast Club just stinks like a main character. And all that's left is a really scary turkey from a movie.
