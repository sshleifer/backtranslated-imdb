It's worth watching this movie if you like to marvel at the special effects. There are some interesting visuals. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, it's typical of the nineties / aught hollywood the idea of ​​dazzling without substance. True to the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth separating the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to begin with. It is nothing original and not very special. So do not enter the story at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, in the end it got a little flashy, diluting the purity of the excellent effects treatment of an invisible (and, sometimes, almost invisible) man. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, it is something worth contemplating (or not contemplating). <br /> <br /> In general, it is a worthy FX movie that is worth watching only for that purpose.
