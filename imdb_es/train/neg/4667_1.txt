Visually crowded, plot less, incredibly overwhelming garbage. Not even close to Greenaway's best work. Avoid it at all costs! <br /> <br /> The superimposed 'split screen' effects do nothing but confuse, the film is very dark most of the time and the 'artistic' composition of the images is extremely pretentious. . <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; Even nudity is incredibly little erotic, since seeing it fill a large part of the film soon becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> Also, the fact that someone can say that Ewen MacGregor's performance is brilliant surpasses me. He showed more skill in the Star Wars series, and that's saying something. <br /> <br /> I have not been so impressed with a movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
