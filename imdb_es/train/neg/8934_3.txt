I bought this DVD without any prior reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover. The Brazilian title seemed very strange to me, but I decided to see him expecting to see a funny comedy like "Switch". However, the meaningless story is horrible and hard to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) undergoes surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood saying that she will be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half of the property of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Throughout the days, Myra and her alter ego Myron corrupt a young couple in their uncle's academy with perverted sex. At one point, the messy script is so confused that I think the whole story was just a mental journey of Myron induced by the accident. Unfortunately, the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to sustain this film. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman to a certain point")
