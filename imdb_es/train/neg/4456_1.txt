This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. The fact that it has a weak history is bad enough, that it has been related to the issue of violence in football makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had many doubts about the premise of this film even before. I started to look, but I went in with an open mind enough to accept the way the writers considered it appropriate to introduce Elijah Wood's character, Matt, into the hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But the film throws inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that in the middle of the movie each one makes you tremble stronger than the previous time. <br /> <br /> Let's clarify a few things: hooligans do not tend to virtually destroy their own pub before a league game race they do not intend to kill each other; ONLY do not use the stone island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, yes). Most likely, they do not, having made an exception to a new member of the firm, jog to the territory of their rival companies to eat cake and puree. And I would love to meet the hool who would go and walk over the best guy in his company to the rival company. (Although you can scratch what I said about the configuration, kill each other if it exists). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I still have to watch a movie on the subject that does not. It contains some fancy quirks, but this is on par with The Firm for its lack of idea. <br /> <br /> It seemed ironic to me that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part. And the plot of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge the morale of Wood and, instead, moves away from any of the signatures that use coca cola. <br /> <br /> I could continue, but I think I have expressed my opinion. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it is very unimaginative, and I am sure that if I had not spent the whole movie lamenting the points, and more, facts above, I would have guessed what was happening before what was he doing. And believe me, I was good in front. <br /> <br /> I have the clear impression that this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women enjoy the injection of emotional problems that arise. <br /> <br /> If I am right, then the creators have completely failed. It's too unreal that it can not be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman who looks for emotional films would care about any of the characters because of their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by the slow motion action, certainly not when it's a fight, since the issue is that a ruck is waking up enough anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments, although unrealistic. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But some slightly amusing moments barely make up for the observation of two hours of completely fabricated slag. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid the plague, even if you do not continue to develop misconceptions of the scene if you are not in the know. If you are American, you can enjoy it, since it is clearly adapted to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is weak, predictable and, ultimately, exaggerated.
