Basically, take the concept of each ghost horror movie from Asia, pass it on and you will get this movie. The story goes like this: a group of university students receive voice mails from their own phones that predict their death. There are some problems with ghosts, that if you've seen any Asian ghost movie, it's not scary for now. This movie was quite annoying because it is very cliché. It's the same bullcrap, different movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are in a very schematic situation, so it's nothing we have not seen in the past. However, the two main acts did solid work. <br /> <br /> As far as gore is concerned, there is not much to do. We received a great sequence that includes an arm that twists the head (I do not know how to explain that), but it was cut so that you do not see anything, except the final result. Sometimes you see some blood, including decapitated arms and a zombie (which looked very good, I might add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The fear in the movie is very small. , and it really is not that scary. Sometimes you will get some spooky images, but it is not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them scared me either. That's really the downside of this (and most of the Asian horror movies) is that if it's not scary, then it's not so good. <br /> <br /> As for the address, Takashi Miike still did a good job. work. He seemed a bit tamed in this movie compared to his previous films, but still portrays much of his messy style for which he has become famous. Many images were very similar to Miike (including a scene with a lot of bottles of dead fetuses), and the last 15-20 minutes seemed much more than the rest of the movie. Still, the film is flawed by its originality. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this only to the people who are great in Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend much better) or the great Miike fans. Warning to those who want to enter Miike, this is NOT your best job. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 because it's just mediocre. Maybe if it was launched 4 or 5 years ago, it would be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I would like to comment on Asian horror movies very fast. Why, if it's an Asian horror movie, is it automatically supposed to be good here (USA)? Many of these films are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summer were here in the 90s. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. And many of these films are based too much on fears and images that if they do not offer the fears that were proposed, they are simply not so good, and nothing would change that. More Asian horror films should be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films that do not frighten or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, directing, cinematography and much more to back them up. . Two films that are not only great horror films, but great films in general. More Asian horror films have to be like that instead of the cliché, "A ghost just wanted to be found, so he killed people through his phone / videotape / home appliances / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc. "
