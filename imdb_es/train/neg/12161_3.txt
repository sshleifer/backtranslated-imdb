"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with a couple of twists added to the back half. The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week. It's another warning story about succumbing to temptation, and it does not add anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who simply has a considerable trust fund. Even though he has everything, he risks losing everything when starting an adventure with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a blonde from Cedar Falls, falls in love with Brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he realizes his commitment. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appears dead in the master bedroom of the large and luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett, he quickly points a finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to become increasingly insane, not that she was the image of stability before. His defense attorney (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is determined to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did he do it or not? How will it end? You can find the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" is broadcast at your local station. And be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
