This movie was not absolutely outrageous, but it was pretty bad. The acting was actually pretty good! Jeffrey Combs did a pretty good job as the mad scientist, which is kind of his specialty if you do not know such things: D. Bill forsythe .. well, I'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this movie. It's too good for this kind of thing, and its role was not exactly demanding. I rented this with the strength of those two drivers, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, hell, it's a movie about half man / half shark. They are not Shakespeare's people. Apart from the plot, which is full of holes, and poor dialogue, I would like to point out that cinematography also left many things to be desired. There were shots in which they tried to look "great", but ended up hiding the scene or simply went out of the ordinary. They also did it many times when they had a decent dialogue and cut themselves prematurely before the person could deliver the line. It was pretty bad But if you are a fan of jeffrey's combs, it's worth checking out. He gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. Because it's not bad either, and neither is the female protagonist. Hell, if I can remember his name, though. In short, I would not waste your time.
