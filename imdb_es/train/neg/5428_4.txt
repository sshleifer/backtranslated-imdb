Another Priyadarshan / Vohra movie was another movie that was seen for TP instead of a real desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars were not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but it goes without saying that I had low expectations regarding this movie. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the casting in general, except for Rajpal Yadav, who once again annoyed him without limits, however he drew some laughs, but these were the standard slapstick. Original jokes, in fact, this whole movie is like playing the dhol, I mean you almost do not need talent to make a loud noise, or even play the odd good rhythm in the dhol for a little while, right? Only those who can carry different rhythms in a pleasant and sequential manner, for a prolonged period, are considered excellent. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires talent, it does not have variations. , and can be fun for a while the dances of monkeys (hmm it sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not an instrument that entertains you for a long time or even makes you dance like the Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo that was playing, sometimes the Dhol played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but above all the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any young man of 24 years earlier than later, I got bored. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good moments from Dhol (good) but after a while, all I heard was the annoying Dumroo (initially entertaining, then tolerable and then irritating), the big and ordinary parts really they assure that this film is mainly good for some funny clips in "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not seen it in Filmy, it comes at night and it's pretty funny). <br /> <br /> This movie had its moments, the actors did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act, although I have seen him in Main Meri Patni?) that bothers more than entertains, I have said many times and I will say it again. I really believe that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have an excellent career ahead in the comedies of several stars, especially. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really fun as the aborted attempts to impress the girl's father, the bizarre tries to attract the girl and move her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after this was over, there was an old attempt to turn this movie into a lot more with an added mystery, which means that once the girl was in it, the following 45-60 minutes were increasingly tortuous, the climax was "SO BAD IS YOUR GOOD CATEGORY", I mean, what were they? think that if you had to have a tense ending, at least make an attempt to make it pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film is also extremely predictable, there is almost no scene that you can not predict and you will not burst into a burst of spontaneous laughter. here, it's more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the films except for the strange hits, down or up, and then quickly falls downhill once they have made friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one in which the film tries to be more than a comedy of the comedy, also many of the jokes were very, very good. Aged and stank of repetition, THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISAPPEARED AND COMPLETELY DECLARE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta as the siren she had to play, and her talent as an actress is seriously questioned, especially in view of her unattractive appearance, if you can not be a HOT and can not act how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film was also weak, with constant female eyes and poor quality lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The songs, except the The title track was not good either, when the songs played in the second half I could feel the collective panting of the audience. <br /> <br /> In a whole movie that is simply normal simply by the cast, and the very low one. expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding it will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you have to watch it on TV for free or a very cheap matinee or something is a necessity, if you pay full multiplex rates, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> -s many jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES AND LAST 15 MINUTES ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s try to be more than what it is was, not the regular cast (I'm happier about that), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s some good scenes towards the beginning, title song, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> <br /> total 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie met my very low expectations, so I give him the benefit of all doubts, in absolute terms this movie was only a 4)
