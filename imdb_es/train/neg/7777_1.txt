This could be a nice movie for children. My grandson saw her once. He was seeing it a second time, I was seeing it with him. <br /> <br /> When the bear is lost on the ice shelf and is in the water, it is trying to reach a piece of ice. says "Come back, stupid, stupid." <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3-year-old grandson to watch movies with words like this on him. <br /> <br /> That's why it's classified. for children. It should be friendly to children. That is what I would expect. published by the Warner brothers and classification of G, I hope this does not contain bad words. The words do not even fit into the movie in most places, as it seems to be added later. And the film is prolonged in many parts.
