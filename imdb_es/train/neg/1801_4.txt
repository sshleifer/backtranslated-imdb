Istanbul is another of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. It is a new version of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner's film, Singapore, from a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike that studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of that great cinematic location in sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially before the camera in every movie, was too old to play these types of action / adventure any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really lack conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she interprets Errol's old love, who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia. She does not remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are looking for some diamonds that have come to his power. I have to deal with them too. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to listen to Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. Actually, first he was a pianist, the singing was a late occurrence. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for those who are fans of that kind of movie.
