Near the beginning, once it has been established that the outcast John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egomaniac rapist, another bandit from the 1930s is cornered on a farm and surrounded by the FBI. The second in command, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), examines the situations, puts a lit cigar in his mouth, takes two automatic loaded with caliber .45 and goes to the distant house alone. Bang Bang Bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the dead malefactor. All in the long term. <br /> <br /> If you're fascinated by stories like Little Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it does not make sense. Pretty Boy Floyd meets dramatically with his passing. Multiple violations of the civic code. A lot of shots with pistols and Tommy pistols. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> Like history, it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part, I suppose, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the pursuit of public attention. <br /> <br /> The image was written and directed by John Milius. It is the guy who wrote in his contract that, in the event that they shoot and kill animals in the course of one of his productions, he must be the designated shooter. Milius is the type, a fan of firearms, who had Rough Riders of Teddy Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War screaming quotes from Henry V - "St. Crispin Day" and all that. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete garbage. "I knew I would never take him alive, and I did not try too hard." That is, kill them all and let God solve them. <br /> <br /> You will love it.
