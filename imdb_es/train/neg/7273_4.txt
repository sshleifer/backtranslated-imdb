This first role for Barbara Shelley (in fact, her first job in Britain after working in Italy), was made when she was 24 years old, and it is safe to say that she made an impressive debut in "Cat Girl" in 1957. Blondes and brunettes receive most of the attention (I will always appreciate Yutte Stensgaard), the charming red-haired actress with a deep voice always exudes intelligence and vulnerability (one of those examples is "Village of the Damned", in 1960). His screen time was much less than that of his character's husband, George Sanders. It is the only reason to see this monotonous update of "Cat People", and it is seen with great advantage in all this (it is difficult to say if its beauty found a point of view). best showcase). Her character apparently sleeps naked, and we are exposed to her naked back when she is awakened (she is also exposed 8 years later in "Rasputin-The Mad Monk", 1965). The dazzling dress she wears for most of The Movie is an amazing strapless wonder (I do not see what she held that dress, but I would love it). In short, a positive proof that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly written paper that would defeat most of the actresses, gets up. above his material and makes the film constantly visible, a real test of the power of the stars, which he would soon find in Hammer's studios in Bray, during the sixties.
