This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's character would have been transferred to the "rubber gun squad" years ago. The entire squad is made up of self-centered egomaniacs who judge people whose actions date back to decades by the 2007 standards. All the veteran Vietnam characters they've had have turned out to be murderers, unless they were another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black assassin, and his white boss put him in a trap. The only Hispanic murderer was a "traitor of the race" who killed another Hispanic to incriminate a Hispanic street child for a crime that (naturally) two rich white children committed. What a lot of propaganda. Hello, screenwriters: minorities and the poor also commit murders. Only in this program are most white high-class murderers. <br /> <br /> In addition, the arrests of people aged 70, 80 and 90 for crimes they committed 50 or 60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will press for a murder because that means the state will be stuck with its huge medical bills until it finally kicks. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will simply plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they will not serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to jail are organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high profile convictions drive DA careers.
