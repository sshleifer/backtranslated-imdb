I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a good tribute to the classic "Zombi" of Fulci. <br /> <br /> So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Well, some of the makeup is great for a movie without a budget and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but otherwise there's nothing. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero Here, but there is not a sequence in the whole movie that has even a bit of suspense or shock value. The director knows how to organize interesting body changes and eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn something else. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with boredom, for me that's not enough, I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> ** of *****
