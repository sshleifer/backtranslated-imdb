I do not know why this behavior was tolerated in the movie business! This movie (short) is disgusting (to say the least)! It is a group of children from 5 to 7 years of age who wear diapers with large tweezers, which act like adults (and too much!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the old days" could not have been so good after all. (Thank God we have laws against this type of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short film from the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
