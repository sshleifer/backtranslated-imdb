I shudder to think what people should have thought of ecologists after seeing this piece of dominant and dominant cinematic garbage. With Starter, who is indecent enough as a garden fan and a brother, to sell a new era store, Starlight makes anyone who cares about the planet look like an idiot who caresses feathers. <br /> <br /> The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute that touches the underwear model in a mystical quest to avoid the impending environmental collapse of the Earth. But first they must defeat an evil alien who does not look like a refugee from a Castro Street bar. Fortunately, they have mystic grandfather Willie Nelson to help him (he looks slightly embarrassed by the process, and he should be too) along with cheap F / X cubes and reams of music that inflates without meaning. <br /> <br /> Sure, the clumsy script helps hide the trite plot of the movie and the amazing pace, but that's just the tip of this iceberg meltdown. All those interested in this film must revoke their union cards until they complete a real environmental science course.
