Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his resemblance, player player Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers' former friend, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a worthy team, as two reporters look for stories about the elusive hero outlawed. <br /> <br /> Of course, the wrong identity / personification is a plot. Development, since Rogers rehearses a "double role". Rogers is charming, as usual; But, there really is nothing that is improving its performance above normal: any potential to deliver a memorable performance of Jekyll / Hyde is done through poor material. The best couple to see is Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as reporters for the St. Louis Journal, which are the highlights of the movie. The songs are fine, although badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James in the Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
