This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that jump right away: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple of trees and bushes. It is not scary at all. Breaking news: if you're filming in the Southern California area, Big Bear is only an hour away. They really have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. The writing was, without doubt, the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, clich√© or just plain stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lame), the name of the clown is "the murderous clown" (lame). What does a clown do in a forest? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the performance. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of lines of shit and bad acting. The worst, by far, was when he then randomly returned to this fat foreign girl naked for a photograph. It's a very long scene and I guess it was supposed to be sexy, but it was NOT. Also, and this was one of the few nice parts of the movie for me, it was this tool that is supposed to be "athletic". For example, when you get bored in the movie, take a couple of stones and start doing curls with them. Then, later, he is supposed to be running for the clown and immediately becomes clear with his very "girl", who is far from athletic. Oh, and for the girl who played Kat, good Lord, stop singing. That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, at least I would recommend seeing the special features. The group of thieves who made this film talks about it as if it were this really original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the script and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently she goes out with special children.
