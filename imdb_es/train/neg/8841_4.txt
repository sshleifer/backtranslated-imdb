The parasomnia has some interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The cast is not convincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in films such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play roles like this in his dream (which is a little what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make any sense at all. The story is quite boring and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This could have been much better, I do not get the good reviews in this case. It really is below average.
