I had to give this movie a 1 because it's so bad, but do not make me think that I did not enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had some questions. So half the time I laughed, half the time it said "what the hell is going on?" or "why would someone do this?" etc. I especially enjoyed the terrible effects of fog, the nudist / battle / dialogue / nudist scene in the style of the 80s, and the way in which the swords of the warriors flutter in the wind when they mount their horses. And there are some effects of fucking models (they're not supposed to be real trees, right?) And I still do not understand this guy they find in the cave, what the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought about trying them, and basically I liked the movie, since people like Ed Wood's films, I do not really enjoy what the movie should be, I look at it. in my own hilarious way So do not let this distract you if you really thought it was an action movie, it is, I just liked it for other reasons. It is much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think as if you were wasting your life to see it (which came to mind several times). I guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have some friends and laugh at this movie. Maybe this is a little hard, but I do not think so, rent it and you will see. I.
