I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans Debut. And I also liked to see how he would do it. I must say that he is excellent in his role. Divya Bharathi is excellent in this movie. Rishi does a wonderful job. Susham Seth supported well.Alok nath was good in his role. Amrish and Mohnish did their thing too. Dalip was also good in his small role. The actors shine in a mediocre movie. The address is normal. The edition is deficient. The story is boring. He tells us about Ravi, a famous pop singer. It has many females. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal becomes a widow. Cousins ​​Ravis. They go to Bombay. He meets Raja. He falls in love with him and gets married. Come back Ravi. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half boring. It also creeps a lot. But it is saved by the actors and the music. The second half entertains. The music is catchy with some beautiful songs. The cinematography looks outdated in t The first half, but it does not seem imaginative. The images of the song are boring, except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. The suits are outdated. Either way, look at this only for the actors and the music. Rating-4/10
