Yes, stupidity! I just finished looking and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "complements" to a story, too many stupid characters (I guess they wanted to achieve comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. It is a pity to spoil one of the divine stories of "Arab Nights" like this one. Childish, naive (both in a bad way) and with many magical mistakes, I do not think this can keep a five-year-old child for more than ten minutes. The princess is lovely, but she should not have tongues, because the actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is REALLY bad. It is a pity that the "good boy" is not better. Only the light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who unfortunately is way below his level with this, but at least he keeps his actor / "fighter" skills on top. I still regret seeing him in something like this, but I'm glad to have something to do with a whole farce, so thank you, David. Alone, ONLY, for him, I give this 2 stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but that would raise the final score to the whole movie. The rest is so bad, that maybe I'd like to rate it, but there is not a lover of grades here, and I think that would be too much.
