This movie is one of the reasons why IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. The acting is horrible, even what some here have praised, the character of Carpathia! The script looks like it was written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher who stayed behind, when Buck asked him what "dan7" meant in the computer graphic, said: "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24". He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers missed this error. Perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically wrong. While many Christians have defended the film's interpretation of the events of recent times, such an interpretation, in * my opinion *, is wrong. To understand these shortcomings, read "Christians Will Go Through the Tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, a Bible Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture" by George E. Ladd.
