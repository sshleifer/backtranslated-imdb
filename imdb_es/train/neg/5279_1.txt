My friends can usually stand many movies without hope, but this one was too poor for us to see until the end. It was so boring and unoriginal. Not even the "hot" girls who starred in this movie could make me see. Everything was predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The acting was sometimes good ... but more times bad. The most annoying character in the whole movie who just wanted to die would have to be the main character's best friend. The more I saw it, the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know what fat and ugly child I mean) <br /> <br /> The plot has been done so many times before I think they should be sued by other film companies. Okay, it's a good idea, but that's all this movie had. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie can only be seen if you do it by yourself, to avoid any abuse of your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
