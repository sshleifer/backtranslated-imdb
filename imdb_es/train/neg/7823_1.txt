This film was extremely poorly conceived from all angles, except the technological one. I stood up and watched everyone leave the theater, their faces vanished as if their lives passed before their eyes; his eyes wandered to his neighbor, wondering if it was just them. I mean, how could the movie really be bad? No one will admit it, it is a classic case of The Emperor does not wear clothes. "Who am I to question a movie that contains a guy who stops a line plane?" But the fact is that all the members of the audience are thinking about what I am writing at the moment. Actually I plagied their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois just gets turned on by the power, she does not even drink a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses that does not stop the planes. It can not be the look in "your" eyes to the depths of your soul or something like that. In the old Supermans, she had some level of connection with him, he was not the number one priority, obviously, but he strengthened her character because she was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite makes Superman what McDonalds does for the average. Person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE". He loses his father from the earth, then finds his true super father, the story is captivating every step of the way. It is human, it is related to people and feels love for people, it is related to high school students, it is related to people who feel different. He relates The Superman returns. Superman seems to relate only to the Superpeople and it seems that he is simply "doing a job" when he is saving people. <br /> <br /> There is something that Lois de Lois likes, she is really in love with him but she can not admit it, and when he enters the image as Superman, he overturns the love in the rocks Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark (at least that's what the movie says, whether it's intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and a SUPERMAN, Clark is like a pile of maneur for Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just saw it again. As a child, "I thought" I enjoyed the action, but now I know that it was the HISTORY that sustained me at that moment, looking at it again and again. If I saw Superman Returns as a child, I would have hated it too, I think. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of heart, soul and superpower in this movie, it is sick. Superman relinquishes his powers for love as a global conspiracy unfolds and, meanwhile, MEAN, while Lex Luther has something fantastic up his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and Clark's inner nature overcomes the power of Superman, because when his supermoral nature disappears and he is SuperHUMAN (who does human things with his superpowers), she sees that it is not the power of Superman who is in love, is not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALel man who loves, and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark that she "prefers" Superman, he's euphoric, he's re-established a human connection. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE TYPE OF MATTER THAT MISSES THE SUPERMANAS RETURNS. <br /> <br /> Clark sneezes to help the boy get a strike, again humanity. In addition, it is an INTERESTING use of superpowers. He is not just using straight brute force. <br /> <br /> He crushes the coal to turn it into a diamond for his wife because she had to sell his, love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than saving. <br /> <br /> There seems to be nothing at stake in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the web of world domination of nemesis ... we see suffering, we see how it affects Pryor and other people and people in between ... there is no harm, especially. Emotional of Lex's plot to sink the United States. We see a glass globe thrown into space. Superman had to be very creative in the first three Supermans to stop the plot against him, he could not just "access" his superpowers. In the first, he had to stop two missiles that went in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase the story to save Lois's life ... (IT WAS THIRTY YEARS !!) In the second, he had to tease to the three guys who was already more POWERFUL than, but combined with Lex's genius and the villains' immoral tactics, overcoming Superman was not enough, he had to work against each other and mock them ... In Superman III, Again, his superpowers were not enough to win ... He had to be more cunning than a computer that calculated everything he saw, he could not use direct aggression on the computer because he calculated it in advance, so he had to use a benign acid that it would, it only became deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression, and it found that acid before, when it could not simply use its superpowers to put out a fire because it was a chemical fire, or what he had to use his superbrains - he could not carry water, so he froze a lake and dropped it in the fire ... Now, in Superman Returns, he simply launches the island into outer space, like a work night for UPS. You do not need to solve anything, just use your "super strength". And it showed the brilliance of Lex Luther at the level of premeditation of a junkie who simply ran out of garbage. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw that island into outer space after being stabbed with a kirptonite right hand knife in the bloodstream and the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores on his face, but he just avoided his eyes and his nose as if he was not looking at Gray Poupon.
