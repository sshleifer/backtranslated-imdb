I'm sorry to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The acting is bad, even wooden, exaggerates the fear factor from the beginning and does not work exactly. I think it was supposed to be a turnaround at the end, but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing. What the hell? Was the guy who was killing everyone one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> It's hardly original, and it's not even particularly good as a straight slasher. And that is saying something. <br /> <br /> I think that who made the releases, who wrote the script, and whoever has thought about the concept should be fired and deported mercilessly. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. If someone puts this in a party, throw the disk out the window and put on a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
