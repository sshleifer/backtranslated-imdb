Oh! This was a bit painful to sit on. It has a nice and funny premise, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always a pedestrian and annoying, and does not disappoint in this case. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville presented surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played well above. I know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame the actors, when the script and the director make them do all that work. If you're going to have extravagant characters, that's fine, but you must have good material to make it work. He did not do it here. Run away screaming from this movie if possible.
