I am a Christian ... and I feel that this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> No one but the Christians in the Bible belt will like this movie. The message is too much on your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you must be much more subtle. You can not have dad waving the bible and taking it with him in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Poor management. The revelation of missing persons should have been terrifying, but it was ridiculous. Do they leave their clothes on the floor? It reminded me of Ed Wood's old movies: "Oh my God, people are missing!" That scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you find your relative's clothes next to you, you will not shout, "My God, they disappeared! They are missing!" and start crying and screaming. First you would be in denial ... you just would not jump to that conclusion. See Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite photo is the dog sitting on the lawn with lots of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I almost fell off the couch, I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and so distracted. It was as if the composer was in his own world writing down his own films. "This is my chance to do a thriller", "This is my chance to take action!" STOP ME LIKE ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good grade backs up what is happening on the screen ... this movie needed more than one LOW score, but instead it was as in its face as the message was. <br /> <br /> The writing was bland. That was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worst: "You do not understand! People are missing!" Brad Johnson was ridiculous. The two outstanding performances came from the Antichrist and the older man (sorry, I can not remember their names). Seeing the "making of" (to answer my question of "what were you thinking?"), The producers, the filmmakers and the actors are cheating ... saying "we're going to reach a large audience", "Johnson is amazing" and "this is like a Hollywood movie". I came to the conclusion that they just do not know what "heck" they are doing. <br /> <br /> I praise the effort. Taking the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. The movie is the best possible way to do that. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNALS, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE IS ART? The conclusion is that the film had to be made by people with talent and vision. Unfortunately, it was not like that.
