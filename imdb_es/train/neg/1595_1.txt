I found the movie attractive because of the new type of Pokémon Celebi. But the plot was offside and did not have as much interest as the other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same cheesy humor and bad cliches. The movie did not help if you wanted to make Pokémon famous. It is better that the film is not associated with anime like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and configuration do not have any level that meets the standards of the original anime. It's a shame to even talk about this movie. I bet Pokémon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and will surrender to Pokémon. Digimon is more an anime and does not fall near Pokémon. The second movie will be released at the end of 2002.
