Imagine converting the American national anthem into a cartoon. Add a couple of cute animals, some terrible word games and a couple of skates and you'll find almost an exact replica of this movie. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this when I was younger; I had my mother rent it at the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not so bad, it's just that the Marxists who watch have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the United States, you will not like this movie.
