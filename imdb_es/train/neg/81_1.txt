Life did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot did not make sense. The acting was terrible! Especially by teenagers. History has been played a thousand times! Are we desperate to give the actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. Once in life, a good movie appears, this is not one of them. Unless you have nothing else to do, you would avoid this at all costs. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I recover them? I would have preferred to scratch my face against a brick wall for two hours and then soak it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.
