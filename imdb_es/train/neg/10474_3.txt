The Omega Code was a model of cinematographic inconsistency. There was a little (but very little) of good acting, mainly from the two prophets and Rostenberg, who only appeared once and did not have lines. Otherwise, the performance was decidedly bad. The plot line was quite weak, and only partially based on a questionable biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the best of the year.
