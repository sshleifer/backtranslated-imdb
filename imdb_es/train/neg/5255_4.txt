Visually speaking, this movie is dazzling. It has some delicious moments of black comedy. But in general, the plot is very clich√©, as is its apparent message. If you're a fan of exaggerated violence in conventional movies like a hostel or a mountain range, you'll love it. If you are looking for something at all, move away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it's not annoying. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be mugged, or tell your friends about a really messy movie, then this is for you.
