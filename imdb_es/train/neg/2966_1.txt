I can not understand all the hype of this movie. Okay, if you like cheap splashes, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors, do not look at this. Personally, I did not like the actors in this movie, it seems that they were hired directly from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you always know what comes next. The general quality of this film lacks the supposedly very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) that we all had in mind, this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation in a film school, with the least effort. Another problem that really diminishes the whole experience is the bad camera (very shaky) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recorded with a single microphone.
