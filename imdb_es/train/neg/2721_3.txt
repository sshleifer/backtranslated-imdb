I'm a big 50s science fiction fan, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural vehicle for a classic science fiction movie, the director was too important to take the film. It is clear that I was working without money, because the whole film is loaded with a bloated dialogue that continues and continues forever. * Never * have I seen so much killing time in a movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds of "footage" throughout the film, and most of the rest are interesting people in a lot of poorly written, running dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but for God's sake ... how could the casting have thought that someone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?
