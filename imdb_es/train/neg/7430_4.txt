It's interesting to see how Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond came on the scene. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the kind Patrick, who works as a leader of ghetto children in "confidence courses". Enamora a woman, who has a child of the mid-90s called Eric. The ex-drunk husband of the woman soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce. <br /> <br /> In a moment, Pierce is innocently making "vegetarian burgers". The husband enters. Pierce resumes the production of vegetarian burgers. The husband then attacks Pierce. Small pieces of half-eaten hamburger fall out of Pierce's mouth. The fight ends abruptly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
