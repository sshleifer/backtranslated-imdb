It was the line of the label "in the tradition of American Pie" that deceived me to rent this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with the big difference that compared to this Jackass, the movie seems to be a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret having rewarded other films with 1 in 10, because now I can not go below that. This makes some bad movies look like cinematic prowess. <br /> <br /> Actually, I turned them off after 45 minutes, and that's something I rarely do. But it was just boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people really reward him with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop on your head when you were a child? Or was it the first movie you saw, so you have nothing to compare it with? Are you still a virgin and you're everything you think about breasts? Something must be wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this one. Even if you're in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it.
