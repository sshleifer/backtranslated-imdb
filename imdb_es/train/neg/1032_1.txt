Although I've never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrible production values), it seems like Shakespeare compared to this pile of trash Hanna-Barbera has brought us! Undoubtedly, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and terrible character created for children (and this includes both the Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose idea was it to create some kind of short mutant dog and let him talk and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with him? Whoever deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The conclusion is that the puppy simply is not funny, it is annoying and it hurts the nerves, and this is only in the BEST episodes! After many years, it would have been better to finish the franchise than create this disaster! I can see why in the live action movie Scooby-Doo they made the villain Scrappy-Doo, since practically everyone hates it!
