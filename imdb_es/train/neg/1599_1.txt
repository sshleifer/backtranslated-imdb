The MEETING OF THE NATIONAL LAMPOON CLASS was a failure when it was launched. He did not stay long in the theaters of my big city. Why? Because it's BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> It's not bad in a good way, but it's wrong in a really painful and unpleasant way. All the cast of actors was mostly unknown and have remained as strangers after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really cool (a parody of slasher movies) but the execution lacks in all aspects. <br /> <br /> Avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than spending a nanosecond seeing this embarrassing embarrassment.
