One can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this movie was too much. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even at the time, it was considered foolish. <br /> <br /> In defense of Ford, it was revealed in an old talk show, which was acting in the story as told by the real Wyatt Earp, who obviously was old, senile and repeated the scene his way . Earp told the director about the diligence and how it was planned to happen during the arrival of the stagecoach, so, despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself says it was premeditated. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays Earp as an honest person. The man, and also his brothers. The story does not say exactly what they were or were not. Most people like to inject a little deception and lack of law into their characters, but that's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them, since it is the law that respects the types of PISTOLS IN THE CORRAL OK. The men who saw it as a race, and believe me, in the old West, did not have time to think much more. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters that are depicted dying in the corral that really did not, all make this a weaker movie. He is further weakened by Mature, who really did not make a convincing Doc. It may be the worst choice of cast for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the old movies were closer to the time and closer to the feeling of truth. After all, Ford got first-hand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It is also weakened by the foreseeable events that involve the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi in those days, and was ready to kill brunette women in a very predictable way to show their patronage to Hitler's idealism. This happens in most movies until the eighties. However, it is not an excuse, and it cheapens art. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always an emotion. In fact, Mature may be the only negative aspect of this movie. Still, it's the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
