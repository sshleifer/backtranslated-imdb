It is absolutely incredible to me that anyone can make the comment that this movie is not predicative. Not only is it an oppressive, but also absurd, staggered preaching, with a dramatic jacket and excessive wear. Upon seeing him, one feels like an 8-year-old boy who is punished for having to write "I will not become a fascist" on the blackboard 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was done during the height of WW2, and it was meant to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he caused (which anybody would wholeheartedly applaud) and I'm sure he captured with precision the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature way, too obvious, hammer, it fails abysmally like a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a silently heroic antifascist; and Lucile Watson as the rich and rude grandmother who little by little realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootsless education has subjected them to all kinds of difficulties, children are ridiculously shown as small robotic snips. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is a noble dimension that I shrugged every time I was on the screen. Each of her words, each of her gestures is meant to express the APOYAL and COMPREHENSIBLE that is of the SACRIFICES that her husband has to do and the great CAUSE he is struggling for, that he must have been connected to receive a painful electric shock if he dared. He allowed any hint of doubt or shadow to surface on his behalf. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this is a very IMPORTANT movie, but not very good.
