This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in my life. Worse than the most abominable American scum; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American scum par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when the plot was talked about, I really thought it was a good idea. It is not. It is an abject rubbish from the very bowels of Satan (who probably could have written a better script if he had dealt with it). Robert Jones, as a producer of Exce, spending the money of our taxpayers (lottery money people) in this nonsense article, should be responsible. Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to remake Deathline? I ask you: camping like a Christmas tree, death line ... "Mind the doors" is a classic of a really bad British movie, we do not need a reminder. And we certainly do not need a poor, second class, poorly written, poorly developed and poorly wasted like this. All this is from the fund agency of the United Kingdom that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay ANY money to see this. It's an absolute and absolute shit: the only salvation for the producers is that they got a lot of cash ... our cash ... to do it. They should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am amazed by the low and low level of this movie. It makes me a monk that our national body for the support of the film really thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry while the idiots are directing the show. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you!
