What has Ireland done to distributors of films that seek to represent the country in such a pejorative manner? This film begins as a primer for film students about Irish film clichés: unctuous priests, spitting before handshakes, cattle squares in the city square, biking through the country's meadows to the bottom of the bland popular music. Quickly, however, it becomes clear that the main theme of the film is the great Papi-O of the Irish clichés: religious struggles. This is a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her son is raised as a Catholic father, which seems a reasonable enough desire, although not for the inhabitants of the 50's of Wexford County with whom he has to live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decides to go to Belfast, then Scotland, where some more clichés are regurgitated. While she is there, her father (who mysteriously resembles George Lucas) and his family at home are subjected to a boycott, which becomes very unpleasant. I will not reveal the ending, not because I think that people should go to see this movie, but because it is not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we are supposed to sympathize with her, but instead, we urge her to get a life. The villagers present themselves as fanatics whose prejudices must be faced, but traumatizing their children seems an inappropriate way to do so. In addition, it assumes the burdens with which it wobbles ineffectively when it tries to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: its lawyer tells the woman that she "must establish preconditions" for her return. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but its themes have been treated in a much more imaginative way and with less recourse to clichés beaten in the past.
