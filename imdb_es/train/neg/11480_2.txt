I watched this with my girlfriend after tripping over him while I was touring the channels. <br /> <br /> I guess we were both expecting some kind of happy and beautiful Christmas movie for the family, but we were extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> the actor who plays the soldier, seems to have 0 emotion, his face looks the same, whether it's cutting Christmas trees, seeing the girl he loves his boyfriend kissing him, or when he is happily surprised by the girl he loves, he is a horrible actor, and at no time did any of us do anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the pretty blonde, blessed with the ability to count points and cheat on her boyfriend, what a trap! and his ambition in life is to live with his parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> So basically it's a story about a man without emotion or feelings that falls in love with a man who counts points and cheats on his boyfriend. It is as predictable as it is, and really a waste of time, you do not gain anything from seeing this, apart from some strange laughter, because everything is very cheesy. <br /> <br /> I love it when his father says that he only eats french fries and did not come French, and everyone laughs, that's the Hillbilly attitude that this film is about, in addition, if my brides dad He was sending me, I would tell him one thing, but not our army. veteran, no sir, let everyone dominate him. <br /> <br /> The movie is what First Blood would have been, if John Rambo had burned himself out as the biggest wimp in the world.
