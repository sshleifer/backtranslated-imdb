Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I have seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-season 1 film (episode K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars," Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, fight through the worst film series in history, handing out lines that must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style work group comprised of Exxon lawyers and GM trying to cut funds for the Mass transit research and energy efficiency. It seems that it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly in Super 8. It makes Logan's Run look like the systemic chapel of the Seven Crusade with Shakespeare. I can not imagine seeing it without the comment of Crow and Servo, since it is unappealable even with that. Clearly, what is needed in Hollywood is a kind of 401K that avoids the need for actors to take bad movies like this one to pay for their medical care. With the theme "rights to pollute and drive", in the end, I'm almost waiting to see a cameo by Charlton Heston in which he delivers his speech "dead hands". Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?
