This movie is horrible. The script is bad, the script is mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless. The emotion and intrigue of the original film are completely absent. This film was filmed in a dark, somber and monochromatic style (to the "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. The morose character of Greg Morrisey shows a facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot lamentably lack here; The few that exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, who continues faithfully in this sequel, but it is not enough to compensate for the other deficiencies. The only circumstance in which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be done would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
