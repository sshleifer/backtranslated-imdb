Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a clue. It's like seeing a very dear relative in the final releases of a degenerative disease!

My son loves the original series, and even some of the derivative films, but he can not stand this nonsense! And let's be honest, you can not argue against the likes of a seven-year-old child
