It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. It is hard to believe that the same director and the actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, bored and does not go anywhere. Where has the wit gone? I'm confused <br /> <br /> Ten years ago I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still vivid in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to see. This is not the fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum): the plot, the dialogue and even part of the film are to blame (the low budget is not an excuse). A big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this you could not enjoy Henry Fool so much ... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do the one with the other ... there is no continuity in the personalities of the characters ... everything is a fraud to attract the fans of Henry Fool to see the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm turning this off now, Henry in some kind of jail with a Taliban?!?!
