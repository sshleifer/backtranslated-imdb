Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth by blowing the back of her head over her boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a rock band of "demons and death" who could not get rid of the sad feelings of her boyfriend's negligence towards her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet in the head) . She returns, however, possessing the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who will replace her in the voices so that the group can finish the album stopped by the premature death of Cassidy. But, Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and the souls must be collected ... she is consumed by this anger towards Neal mainly, but all the members of the band or anyone inside the music studio die when they fall into the prey of those who They think it's a rather distressed, Dora ... no Cassidy comes back for a refund. <br /> <br /> Lousy, the micro-budget horror movie seems cheap, has a cheap cast that should make plans in another line of work, and has cheap killing scenes that are not. It's not a bit effective .
