I rented this on a DVD and I feel bad, since Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about it in the comments on the DVD. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that desperately wants to be a deep commentary on human nature without realizing that its history is practically a genre. In addition, it is a bit simplistic on the subject in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often stresses the belief. I'd say it's a movie from which you'd get something if you do not have a lot of film / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics). ). Otherwise, your point has been made earlier and more artistically. And that brings us to the big problem, which is that it really does not have much cinematic interest besides the point. It ends up being a rather bland film in general that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and really not worth it.
