I will not describe the story, as it has been done in other places. We're big fans of Clive Owen, and when Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we would never have heard of this "movie", because it was a BBC Television movie in 1992. Therefore, poor production values, grainy image, the work of uneven camera and poor sound. <br /> <br /> But, you really do not care about mechanics, because history itself will make you sleep. It is an interesting human story, but not entirely convincing, and there is almost no end. You really do not care about the characters, since their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save two hours and do something to make the time worthwhile.
