Interestingly, it is the eyes and mouth of Rene Russo, not Buddy the Gorilla, that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy," a production of Jim Henson Pictures through Zoetrope by Francis Ford Coppola. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face slipped into the postproduction stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times that the poor monkeys are eclipsed. A true story, involuntarily funny, adapted from the memories of Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint about the wife of a wealthy doctor who turns his mansion into a collection of pets and wild animals. The film goes beyond good intentions ... positively drips with sincere sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of "family movie" magic it needed, and in a short time both people and animals seem clearly programmed (nothing feels real here). Approximately ten minutes later, two chimpanzees are doing nonsense in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher knife from one side to the other (he misses Alan Cumming's head by centimeters); However, do not raise your eyebrows because everything is in a day of fun. Still, when the adult Buddy Gorilla goes crazy during a thunderstorm, the police are called, and everyone looks at Buddy through the window while busting furniture in the room. The furniture should be the least of the concerns of this excellent failure. But, at least, we know that Russo was in good hands: every time director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up, it gives Rene an extreme close-up. I wonder what was the budget for lipstick in this photo? ** since ****
