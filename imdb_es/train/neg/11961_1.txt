Anyone who can find a redeeming value in this piece of garbage should be examined. We have the submissive woman, addicted to heroin and part-time, with lacerations throughout the body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now, she's dripping mother's milk all over the kitchen floor, the release has somehow won, as if Helen Keller placed her hands in running water. We have the husband who starts by sponsoring a prostitute who turns out to be his daughter (she is upset with him because he came too fast) and ends up murdering his colleague, having sex with her body and then cutting her off. We have the child who is harassed relentlessly by his peers and who comes home and hits his mother. You see, everything is circular. Deep, eh? The only decent moment in this horrible pile of guts is when the father murders his son's torturers. It is good that this turkey has been filmed on video because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive film. If that person who thinks that artists should be interested in this pending is really serious, it is not surprising that most people think that artists are crazy. We saw this terrible movie, then we put "Zero Woman, The Accused". Oh my God, it was a rebound as to which was worse. What is happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
