I think he sucked ice, because he left the bucket and gave us a lot of information about who he is and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and left everything to your imagination. This crap fest, however, gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the performance is solid, I think the reason why this was a disappointment was because it was made by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali doing this prequel, or even the sequel I think It would have been better and it would have been more faithful to the source. so I recommend you stay far, far away from this, and HYPERCUBE, another movie that I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave it a 2 just for the performance)
