And a self-admitted to boot. At one point, the doctor's assistant refers to himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time exploring the premise. Most of the time on the screen is divided between the domestic battles of the comatose bride and the brain donor killer's pursuit. Try to be a science fiction / drama / thriller movie, but do not meet any of the three. <br /> <br /> Like Frankenstein's remake, this one is missing everything that made the original good. Nobody calls the doctor crazy and does not even threaten to throw him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a comatose victim who opens one eye and the amazing computer that makes it come true is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to fail, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about who could be the killer is broken by showing him progressively in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing a person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as a scenario is overestimated and underutilized. The opening sequence is the main key that this is happening in SF, a cable car plays an important role, potential customers live in a Victorian hill, Pier 39 makes an appearance and the final confrontation occurs in Golden Gate Park. More specifically along ten feet of cliff side in the park, just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the foundations of obvious landscapes are rounded, no other attempt is made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> The performance is the only salvation here. Keir Dullea shows a good range and brings out a couple of genuinely emotional scenes. Suzanna Love portrays the recovery of a good coma. Tony Curtis only receives a handful of lines and the double evil looks with most of the Frankenscience explained by his assistant. The little blond boy also hits his signals pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also gave her an extra star for the scene in which the husband drives south from the bridge, cuts into a U-turn in an unrelated parking lot, and then instantly returns to the bridge driving north. It takes a lot of something (courage, ignorance, deadlines) to try to pass it through the spectator during the pursuit of a single car.
