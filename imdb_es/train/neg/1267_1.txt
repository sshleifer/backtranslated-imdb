Because I? Why should he be subjected to such a massacre of what could have made an interesting plot ?! At least, if I can warn other people, it will have been worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and would have made it clear. The film was slow, had a PERMANENT development of a small character, and focused on the idea that a spooky white man can become great if he comes out with an LA-style black token. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical sensation of LA of a vertiginous superficiality: see the movie. Keep in mind, however, that this film does not expose what we have come to consider as a "Los Angeles lifestyle", but it is a wonderful example of the products that come out of it.
