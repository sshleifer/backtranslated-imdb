Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek at age 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked. She does a pretty good job interpreting an immature and insecure beauty of 16 years, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many photos of a beautiful Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> < 1) Peter Hooten presents the worst performance of an actor, since Brutus played the friend of Caeser in "Processes of the Roman Senate of March 15". He delivers each and every one of the lines in a delicious baritone. Lower the volume each time you speak. Preferably all the way down <br /> <br /> 2) Bo's fantasies are sadly docile, especially by today's standards. A few laps in the bathroom and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is more scarce than Bo suits
