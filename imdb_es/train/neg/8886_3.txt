Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer spoilers to this movie, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and, from there, it's like seeing the paint dry. The performance seems very poor too, and it reminds me of the old black and white films of the Maoist era that are occasionally shown on Chinese television during the day. Although this is hard to say with the female role, Yuwen, since the story seems to require that she only walk like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the fainting star, Gong Li, who somehow earned a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's film 'Blue Kite' was a much better movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that spring in a small city was established in the late 40s. Unlike the blue kite, the fact that this movie is set in a moment of turmoil is irrelevant to the plot in itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a scenic background. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to take advantage of the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeals to a foreign audience that can not tell the difference between a "deep" or "hypnotic" movie? "or" hypnotic "and another simply tedious. and insubstantial. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of 'overrated', here it is. I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
