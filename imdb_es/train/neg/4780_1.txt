I think this caricature is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years old. I liked this program when I was 4 and 5 years old, I only saw it when there was nothing on. Now I have another 5 and I would prefer to do my homework before I look at it. The cartoon used to be a little funny, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now that I'm older, I'm interested in showing that witches have not qualified us. I started seeing Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This caricature did not last long, it only had 6 seasons, it was canceled because it was scarce for the spectators, but some people say that it was because the writers were left without ideas, but for most of the other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
