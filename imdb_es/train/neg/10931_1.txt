I went to see this movie with quite low expectations, thinking it would be a good fluff. Unfortunately, it was not even that. I could barely sit through the movie without wanting to leave. I went with my two children (10 and 13 years old) and they even asked me: "How much longer?" After last until the end, I kept wondering who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard could not save the well-worn dialogue, the jokes of the state and the banal plot. I would suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie (I use the term lightly) should take a screen writing class online or go through their local community college for a film class. At the very least, there are many books on direction, screen writing and film production that will teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and rhythm.
