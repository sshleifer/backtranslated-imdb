First I want to say that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it is like to work in a feature film, as well as suggestions for filmmakers in that sense. I am in favor of positive and uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the open Christian message; For me it was just that the execution is where the movie fell on his face. A film lives and dies in its history and here it has one-dimensional stereotypes, abundant exhibitions and spontaneous changes in the behavior of the characters that, at least, are inexplicable. I think a movie does not have to be stuck in your head with your message to convey the message. I'm sure Kendrick's brothers. It will improve with time and its narrative methods as well. Maybe they could direct another person's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports films are not exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you're interested in a movie rated by PG that inspires, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill'. All truth is the truth of God ...
