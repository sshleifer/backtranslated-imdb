The plot and the characters are ridiculous and hardly qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus and blurry. The fact that Fulci has filled the whole movie with fog does not help. On the other hand, everything is completely strange and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, however, he clings to the new boy in a minute of screen time, and has a pack of women next to him. Although he shows his antisocial tendencies by randomly hitting some poor poor little thing that only deals with his own business, the images of flowing blood or blood attract more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci? . Maybe it ruined his career, but in reality it was not much more stupid than Zombie. It is worth renting if you like bloody Italian movies or if you are desperate for sword and witchcraft or something strange. How do you sleep when someone sucks you in a hole 2 feet from your head and screams for help?
