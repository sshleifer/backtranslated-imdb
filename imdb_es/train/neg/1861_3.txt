You know what kind of movie you're getting into when the main character of the serial killer is being transported to the electric chair (in what appears to be a bakery truck), only to have the prison vehicle collide with (and I'm not doing this above) a genetic engineering tanker truck. The gushing goo melts it, and merges its DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film, however, is a photo over the shoulder of the snowman hitting some poor imbecile, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white gloves of oven clamps. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, you imbecile ...
