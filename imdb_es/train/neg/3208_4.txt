This movie was a big disappointment to me. I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut half the story, they altered the information. The claim that Lucifer is Hope's father is not true. He corrupted his father, but he himself is not his father. The voices were also not adapted to the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is that if you love Lady Death, do not watch this movie. It just did not do the comic justice at all !!
