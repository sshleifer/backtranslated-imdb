Unless someone enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like an image with a message but it is far from it. This film tells the useless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that is basically everything. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it's not hard to think about how meaningless and boring this movie is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other one is "Simone") that deserves the title "The most boring and meaningless movie of the year". So, what's happening, Al?
