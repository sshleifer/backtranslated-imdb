misdirected garbage. a mediocre sadistic nihilist gorefest ... if you're the kind of person who likes that ... see a shrug. Even if you are that person, it does not make this a good movie, the acting is really bad, the story is full of plots, the director really should give up and find a real job since he has no talent for it. I can see why people do not like uwe boll ... we've had some of their movies lately and this is the best of all, which is really sad! A complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to suit some people, but here it simply laughs. Horror films can be full of desolation, they can be works of art in miniature, they can be simply a good visualization when there is nothing else in ... SEED is really very poor.
