Very old-fashioned movie, with a horrible dialogue, clich√© and mawkish and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk constantly overreact. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total perforation, full of histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is horrible. The camera movements are without imagination as is the construction of characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors smoke constantly and we see advertisements for beer drinks. Very cheap, by the way. (One exception: Ned Beattie's pleasant and simple way of playing the hit man).
