"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light and familiar films that you can watch and do at the same time the crossword N.Y. Times. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you do not have to "Pause" the DVD. Just let it roll, because you will not miss anything really important. No twists, turns, or tensions. It's not really an ethnic film, it's a film about a family of poor immigrants with difficulties that turns out to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. He made very little difference. I've seen it a million times before. Simply connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Only the accents and the names were different. If the Vargas family were called Bush or Clinton and they were Presbyterians, the film would have been a total nap. <br /> <br /> It's funny that critics here have not been able to understand the place well. Some said it was the Spanish harlem. Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn. As a lifelong New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met anyone except other Latinos. They lived in a small isolated / isolated enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos could have created some emotion, interest or tension. Do you remember the history of the West Side? <br /> <br /> And now for the cinematography so criticized. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots seemed very ORANGE. The apartment, the furniture and the faces were all orange. What is that supposed to mean? And the apt. It looked pretty tight for me Someone here mentioned that the old apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What the owners have done is divide a large one into 2 or 3 very small ones and put as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing ... This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week in which a teenager appears "masturbating." Is this private sexual act necessary for us to see? Please forgive me! What's up with these directors? <br /> <br /> So "VÃ­ctor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice for a change to see the young Latino actors who had a break and the opportunity to show their talents, what they did. But the writers disappointed them, giving them a flat and unspectacular script to work on. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers close to the "fast forward" button.
