Hmm, hip hop music to a western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and many others to keep track of. "The lists are in the house" !? A well-groomed nails in the girls who ride hard. Microphone packages clearly visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I just can not continue with the litany of mistakes made by the director and the editors. <br /> <br /> The acting is not as bad as the one I've ever seen. The women did well with a poor script. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speak in his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The fabulous costumes, although completely incorrect. I just can not believe that they would disobey what could have been a great story. I would be offended to believe that this film was loaded with such ornaments that I could play well inside the city. <br /> <br />
