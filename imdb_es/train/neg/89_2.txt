I have seen all four movies in this series. Each one moves further and further away from the books. This is the worst yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book of which it is titled in any way! The directors and producers should have named it in another way than "Love's Aliding Aliding". The only thing in this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names / ages / genders of the children are wrong. The whole story line is nowhere in the book. <br /> <br /> I find a great bad service for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is so loud. The actors are not convincing, they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this could work. Is it clean. However, do not look at it if you are waiting for a condensed version of the book. I hope this is the last film in this series, but I doubt it. If more films are made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr. and others stayed closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, if they are followed closely, they would be excellent movies!
