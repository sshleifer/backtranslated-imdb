Well, I have to admit it was one of my favorites when I was a kid, when I used to watch it on a domestic projector like a super-8 reel. Now there is not much to recommend, apart from the inherent field value of the actors who are "terrified" by the replicas of human skulls. The special effects are quite silly, and consist mainly of skulls in cables and images of superimposed "ghosts". <br /> <br /> But there is something to be said for the sets. The large mansion in which it takes place is quite spooky, especially since it is almost unfurnished (probably due to budgetary reasons?). However, this definitely inspires more laughter than shouting. He just tries not to laugh when the wife (who does more than screams) enters the greenhouse and faces the ghost of her husband's ex.
