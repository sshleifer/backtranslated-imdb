Nathan Detroit has illegal dice games for high rollers in New York, but there is a lot of heat and he can not find a safe place. He bets on the chronic Sky Masterson that Sky can not make a primitive missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky accepts the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store. <br /> <br /> This is one of those expensive MGM musicals in bold colors, with big stages, loud music, bigger roles than real life. and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that kind of thing, which I do not like. My main problem with this type of movie is simply music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway shows the melodies at the moment of the swing with endless trumpets of pah-tah-dah at the end of every fourth bar is not my cup of tea. This was written by the label team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of stories by Damon Runyon), and although the plot is quite affable, the songs are weak. The two numbers of Blaine, for example, are identical, unnecessary, do not advance the plot and gratify the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that kind of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as might be expected) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (very well played by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get to them The trump card of the film is a young Brando that offers a thoughtful and relaxed performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and he combines in a uniform way with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two escape to Havana at night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and murder of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals can dig this, but from my point of view, a musical has to do more than just shoot the stage show.
