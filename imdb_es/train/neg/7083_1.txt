My husband rented this in a video store thinking that it was suspense. (Never read the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be funny if the thing were visible. It just is not. The same thing again and again, without intrigue, and WHERE did they find the main man? The protagonist, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasibly handsome, especially for the role he deserves. In addition, sexual harassment at work is something that, if you want to see, rents the "Revelation" by Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually observable, plays a shameful scene here. There are also cheaper lighting effects than your webcam at home. Do not even waste your time renting this. 0/10.
