This series had potential, but I suppose the budget would not allow it to see that potential. An interesting configuration, not unlike the "lost", falls completely after the first episode. The entire series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90-minute movie, but the creators chose to drag it over and over again. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without advancing the action. The music was very annoying and did not work in general. There were few characters that we cared about since their characters did not grow during the period of time, well, one grew a little. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only congratulations here are for the art department and the decorators, they created an interesting aspect, that badly that the writer and the director did not have the foresight to do something interesting with that element
