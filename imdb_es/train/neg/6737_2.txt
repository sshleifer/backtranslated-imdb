If Deborah Messing was no longer broadcast as "Grace", this could be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of an frustrated old maid with problems, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) that she reads in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's wedding in London. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Neither funny nor remotely romantic, the wedding date slides over the plot of deceptive sex on the part of the bride and the godfather, and paid the escorts to pass the film as Four weddings without Hugh, and definitely, an agreement with no way out for the naive boyfriend who ignores the sexual history of his girlfriend (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the repressed princess, a 30-year-old woman with a history of failed relationships, her neurotic movements and drunks in another faux beau are simply the replay of her television series. If this woman is an actress, get a paper that does not repeat what is already in primetime. <br /> <br /> A lot of drunken women, cricket visual jokes and Mulroney on a towel (good!), but the movie is a bore with the obvious happy ending. The sequel to Messing: Divorce Date is expected.
