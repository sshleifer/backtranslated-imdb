Despite being a big fan of the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it was not until about 6 years ago that I first saw "Follow the Fleet". I knew all the songs on an old Astaire / Rogers album (yes, vinyl) but I did not know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and fun, you just can not like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to compensate his life partner, he continually sabotages his career. His character does not have the usual humor and enthusiasm of the other Astaire characters in the movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.
