The blue jumpsuit is actually mentioned in the movie, but not in any way that makes any sense. At one point, some children are wandering through the deepest levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They begin to discuss what they will find down there and one of them (a girl) says that they bet that they will find a blue jumpsuit. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Totally irrelevant to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why he would assume he would find a blue jumpsuit in the basement of a hospital. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to have remembered it, but someone had to remember, I suppose!
