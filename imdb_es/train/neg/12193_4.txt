"Look, I know this may stink at this moment, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever, whatever it is that is burning on the celluloid forever and for the next thousand years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director who hired several screenwriters to adjust the script to fit his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently freed from the Robert De Niro prison. As "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the dysfunctional family bands come together to defeat the beast, the beast was the creation of the father, a lawyer who did not defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In typical Spielberg style, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and then is absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and practically all the figures of "dads" in the land of Spielberg, the father claims his fatherly duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg finally abandoned the image and the project was handed over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was trying to try his luck at a more commercial rate. The result is possibly the worst film in Scorsese's filmography and, ironically, his most enlightening film. <br /> <br /> Failures or failures of an artist are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of his art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images do not burn, we find ourselves with a kind of inner core. Is ?? The rest of the body is what the director's cinema is about. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal movie, so we will not find any thematic connection with the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("Ya sacrificaste" De Niro screams, but the themes of the films of Catholic redemption is "cookie cutter." However, what the film does is expose the kind of language your filmography is based on. Notice how Scorsese's camera moves desperately back and forth, how it approaches frantically to the knobs of the doors and the windows in an attempt to force the tension and how their characters are noisy and scream to attract attention, but the most important thing is to see how the film has no spatial sense. The end of the film takes place in an obvious sound stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and does not have a broader context and the family home does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. you have no geographical sense at all in the image, Scorsese can not film the space or create any kind of space environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be tied, or intimately tied, to its central character. For the world around the character to make sense, your camera should be focused on the character. Resnais can take you to a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance on a street and climb a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate a future urban landscape, Lucas can give you an alien planet from the desert. and most other directors can create a sense of space by means of the textbook combinations "medium shot to medium wide shot", but Scorsese can not do this. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He is all about the character. You break that tie, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi, you look away from De Niro and everything collapses. It simply can not break with this filming documentary style, which, in some way, is a prerequisite for the realization of action films. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and sets become the central character, but even this self-consciously spatial experiment is sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis , the actor who draws Scorsese's camera inexorably towards him like a moth to a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking movie. Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the stupid special effects of rotorscoped and the fight against punching. Still, we have Robert De Niro to help us. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese as a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only big scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with a young Juliette Lewis, he puts his thumb in her mouth and kisses her. As a kind of symbolic violation, the girl escapes, both awakened and rejected by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so deliciously exaggerated, simply can not be imitated by Scorsese. You would need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> It's worth a visit.
