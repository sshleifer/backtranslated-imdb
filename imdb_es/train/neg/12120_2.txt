In what could have been a mediocre movie about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle period of "free love"), the creators of this film are piled up in a ridiculous scenario behind a ridiculous stage and finish it off with a threshing Little cherry on top, happy forever after finishing. At no time did I feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in her troubled middle-class life without care, nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The story line advances slowly until it reaches its predictable and pathetic conclusion, and the only interesting and visible part of this film is the dazzling topless Diane Lane. Here is a clue, it occurs around 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to that part and skip the rest.
