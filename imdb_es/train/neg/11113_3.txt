I often feel like Scrooge, hitting movies that others are delirious about, or write the review to balance the unjustified criticism. I found this film almost indisputable, and, unusual for me, it was rapidly advancing not only through boring and clichéd dialogues, but also boring musical numbers and clichés. Whatever the originality that exists in this film (an unusual home environment for a musical, a lot of fantasy, some animation) is more than compensated for by a script that does not have an ounce of wit or plot development that provokes reflection . Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be good people, but they can not take a movie as a team. None is really charismatic or has much sexual attractiveness. Both are bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite a note. The best part of the movie, for me, are the beautiful costumes and the great body of June Haver.
