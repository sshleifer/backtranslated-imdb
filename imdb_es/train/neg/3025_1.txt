This movie is really bad ... no, I mean really very bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Of all the films he has made, I only like him as an enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worst directors of all time. What horrified me the most is that Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the script for this. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but getting involved in this makes me hope that he has learned the lesson. <br /> <br /> Now I love the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I can not even please him for this. History and aspect of it. Do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he has made some changes in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knightly, I think she is too overvalued. I just can not feel it for her in the movies. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is bad. that's ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
