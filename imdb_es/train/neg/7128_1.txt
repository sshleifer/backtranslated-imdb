I'm a stupider person to rent the REDLINE DVD. Chicago Pictures, who made this stupid movie, never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on several car sites, including mine, which has a ALEK rating of 16K. I got ripped off in the deal and now I'm losing $ 16,000 and I lost a lot of my personal time (peter rapport of Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie! It sucks and the people behind it are scam artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
