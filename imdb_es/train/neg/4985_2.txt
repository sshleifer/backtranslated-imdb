['In 1993, &quot;the visitors&quot; was a great success in France. Then, the sequence was inevitable and, unfortunately, this sequence is among the worst in history. <br /><br /> This is a movie that does not keep its promises. In fact, he is supposed to tell a unique story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier to the Middle Ages so that time can run its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely comfortable in the world of the twentieth century, so making it go back to the Middle Ages is quite difficult ... Instead, the film continues with other stories without success in following the main ones plot. As a result, the film sometimes becomes confused, sometimes a little messy. <br /><br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that, however, they could avoid in the first film: they go over and become annoying. So, why did the filmmaker Jean-Marie Poiré hire Muriel Robin in the female lead role? He made a mistake because she seems uncomfortable and it is absolutely regrettable. The other actors are not better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau is unbearable. <br /><br /> Of course, the film contains some good moments with efficient gags, but often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogs are affected. It also seems empty because Poiré removes the elements that ensured the success of the first film. Therefore, a girl takes Reno by a close relative of her family and asks her to participate in her wedding. <br /><br /> A laborious and disappointing follow-up. Anyway, what interest does this otherwise commercial film have? <br /><br />']
