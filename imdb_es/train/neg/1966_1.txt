I was tricked into seeing this movie after reading a positive review of another website and, I could see it! It took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the shelf because I did not want anyone to see me. Then another 10 minutes to gather the courage to take it to the counter and use real money to rent it. I thought all my stress would be rewarded by the time I got home and seeing the movie b / c, the review I read said that the movie was a pleasant surprise; What a joke! If you can spend the first hour of the movie, then you're in luck! b / c is not until the movie becomes a horror. Do not bother with these people, better see "drops of moisture"
