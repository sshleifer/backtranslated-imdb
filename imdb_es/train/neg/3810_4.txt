When I was younger, I liked this program, but now ... This show is boring, badly written and rarely fun. The three protagonists were all good actors and funny men (Saget's defense was much better than the things he came up with in this program, as well as Coulier, and Stamos was a better actor than the average). After a while, Stamos wanted to leave the program because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show was finally canceled when many of the actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that drive me crazy with the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Key phrases: how many times can a person endure tired phrases like "rude", "understood" , "nerdbomber", "eliminate" and "have mercy" in a period of 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler, the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing: stale and cliché like an oreo cookie. There is good cliched writing and cliched bad writing. Full House had bad cliché writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco: I said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things: too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashionable kids: the girls had all the latest fashions in the mall and you can see posters of artists from modern recordings they would be interested in. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I believe that many of them have talent in their own right. But this show was so sweet that I could not stand it after a while.
