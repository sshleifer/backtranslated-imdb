Why?!! This was an insipid, boring and embarrassing movie. The shame comes from being from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did you let these people make a BAAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this film was originally released ... it was more a romantic comedy ... and nothing of ROBO. All that was changed along with the courtesy of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic book character. Seeing Matthew Broderick making fun of his own movies was not fun either. Sheesh !!
