This is like the sixth movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the department of death. The sentences of a line are bad and are something that should not be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes out as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes it worthwhile. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. In general, it's better than the sixth, but it's still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
