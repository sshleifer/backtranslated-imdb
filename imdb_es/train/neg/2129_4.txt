In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has two things in its favor: Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a version filmed with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to see). But for me that's all there is. The majority of the cast seems to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and it's not surprising that people walk on Harry McAfee when he is played by George Wendt, who seems to prefer to be back on a stool in Boston. . Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the scenario script now, but I hope the young people, who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge them all for this.
