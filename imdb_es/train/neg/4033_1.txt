It hurts me to write such a scathing critique, but by not doing so, I am simply encouraging these people. First of all, just because a movie is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good or attractive. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the movie's only achievement in the sense that it prevented large amounts of money from being squandered on a single-legged racehorse with shit. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Did you ever hear people laugh and think "what the hell are you"? Well, even these goats were not laughing. Things got so bad halfway, my cat took his first bath. This is not a movie, this is children ... there are no monkeys making images that make you feel like you are going to France. I have to go, there is a clown at my door .............
