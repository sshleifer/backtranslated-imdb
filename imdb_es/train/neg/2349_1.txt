There was a great movie to be made about Steve Biko. Unfortunately this was not all. Denzel Washington, never the most flexible of the actors, is totally incapable of transmitting the great charisma that Biko had. The scenes of the great Attenborough crowd are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like that, three neat lines of children (some doing cartwheels!) Marching cheerfully towards the soldiers' weapons. With Biko dead, the movie quickly descends to the farce. If the fight against Apartheid was anything, it was a struggle of the blacks, but somehow, we are all supposed to be caught by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and would be the first to say that Biko was important, while he was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems not to notice that she is in South Africa. absolutely. The dog of Wood's family has more lines than the black maid. While the family escaped, the women with whom I saw the film, by the way one of a dozen black people in a large and complete cinema, whispered: "This is like the sound of music." She had a point. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film of a well-meaning white liberal, although somewhat inept, about the struggle of radical blacks. And really South Africa needs well-intentioned white liberals, as if it needed a hole in its head.
