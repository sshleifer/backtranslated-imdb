Lying down and drugged, while a stone in the kidney made its way through my scarring of the urinary tract, with nothing better than letting the analgesics let me fall into semi-forgetfulness, I found this movie on the wire. I would not want anyone to think that I paid to see it in a movie theater, or that I rented it, or? For heaven! ?? I saw it DIRECT. <br /> <br /> After having played this sensationally frightening video game and stepped hungrily on The House's doomed rooms and fearsome corridors, fighting against Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and Other impossible sentinels, my curiosity woke up as to how the game would be transferred to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> It does not. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy children" ?? to the scooby doo? Attend a remote island for a soulful "rave"? whatever it is. (Children today with their hula-hoops and their miniskirts and their Pat Boone?) After bribing a captain of a boat with thousands of dollars in cash to transport them there (a stupidity that begs for their own network of rhetorics), they find the "rave" "deserted. <br /> <br /> Is there a mention of a" house "? Presumably the titular house of the dead? but most of the action takes place in false outdoor settings and in other places separated from any appearance of haunted residence. <br /> <br /> Does a falling video camera act as a flashback fill, showing the island in the middle of a? match ?! Is that so? Oh, then Is this "rave" thing just a "party"? In the great tradition of re-euphemizing "used cars" as "used", or "shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "party" now Is it too square for your drug addiction, silicone, implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> It was learned that the party was divided by exploding zombies ... Does smart thinking stop here? <br /> <br /> I do not think the pinheads who call themselves scriptwriters and directors understand the myths behind the re-animation of zombies Can not zombies die? They are already dead. They do not bleed, they do not know pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue to be animated. At least, that's what my priestess witch from Jamaica tells me. <br /> <br /> Which means that a .45 shot in their "hearts" will not stop them, not even a machete in the torso. And a burst of shotgun in the chest will NOT produce drops of blood. At least in the logic of the game, the shooter pumps so many rounds to each monster that is completely decimated, leaving a fetid patch that can not be animated again. <br /> <br /> However, each actor bar model receives its Matrix-circular-camera moment, killing zombies on all fronts with individual bullets and karate chops on the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers of "Return Of The Jedi", who are eliminated when the Ewoks defeat them. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the writer of the film, Mark Altman, having written the not too-week "Free Enterprise", felt obliged to insert a reference of Captain Kirk, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who he must have needed the money from the milk to have desperately succumbed to appearing in this aromatic cigarette butt. There is also a reference to the prime role of Prochnow in the magnificent "Das Boot", when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he "looks like a submarine captain". "I wonder how many of the target audience of this square-eyed pig movie caught ANY of the malicious references to other movies, such as when Prochnow states," Say hello to my little friend, "foreshadowing the timing of his machine gun. > <br /> Aimed at a demographic group that does not have the means to understand the uselessness of Sisyphean's videogame concept (ie, the game ends when you die, you can not win), this is nothing more than a slasher movie for As a result, all die in due time, except for a heterosexual pair of white attractions. <br /> <br /> A better use of the scarce but poorly used budget of this film might have been to send the cast to Acting At school, although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, like her right breast and those sensational scenes: it's priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona treated She tried to act as if she had been stabbed, but it seemed she had only eaten ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Trying to do something more against structuring with my time, I took out my Anamorphic Front Panel DVD, Special Edition, 35th Anniversary, digitally restored, from "Manos: Las manos del destino". Oh yeah! ?? the drugs were suitably numbing - now HERE were some quality films? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
