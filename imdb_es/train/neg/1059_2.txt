I saw this movie last night and I'm already struggling to remember a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals escaping from a space criminal colony. They fly to the moon in a space-age trash carrier; when they are there, they terrorize the garbage workers who work at the lunar base. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that low-budget science fiction films often involve desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escaping the penal colonies. . Why this is I have no idea. But I can say with certain certainty that such films are always diabolical. This is not really an exception. It starts reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a soundtrack halfway through dance music. Then it degenerates into a boring science fiction thriller. So little of the importance really happens in this movie that I'm literally struggling to write a useful review, so if you're reading this, I apologize for not being able to enlighten you with the subtleties and nuances of the movie. For the record, I remember a tedious group of bad guys, a tedious group of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Apart from that, I'm fighting. <br /> <br /> If you think you might be interested in the activities of the lunar garbage men, I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send your friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
