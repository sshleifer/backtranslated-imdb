I felt sadly disappointed by this movie because it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to take the movies to a rather weak attempt at horror. The basic idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately I was not able to thrill, really scare or hit me; there was a part in the whole movie that I thought was scary, but even that did not redeem her. I liked the character of Kate at the end of the film, since it seemed to soften and become a little more realistic at the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for this film and I think the director / writer I got carried away by the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if I had left it in the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate's part, it might have worked. Jeremy's performance was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable. Seeing the bad in the chemistry of the screen, or the lack of it. It is a pity. Disappointing.
