Look at the original with the same title from 1944! This made for the television movie, it's just terrible! Although it uses (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialogue, it just does not work! Is it the acting, the poor direction? It's fine, it's made for television, but why see a copy in disrepair, when you can get the excellent original? Especially because you will be in a bad state of the plot and you will not enjoy the original as much, as if you had seen it first! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (it is shorter for once), but they are all for the worse! The actors who play the parts here, just do not fit perfectly! You just do not believe them and who could surpass the performance of Edward G. Robinsons from the original? If you wish, just see it after you have seen the original, and even then you will be very brave, if you observe it. It's almost a sacrilege!
