Many people like to point to this television movie when they argue with the vast legions of Hanks-philes that Tom made fucking movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dragons and Dungeons style game" that eventually leads our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charming in the early 1980s, and it focuses on the imminent threat to our youth that they represent those evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to see "Mazes and Monsters" as the turning point in the "What happened to Chris Makepeace?" history. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave everyone an indirect emotion by defeating Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" On a regular basis) that saved him great things. <br /> <br /> And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is very thin, so I leave it to you to decide whose fault is the Makepeace performance. All I know is that the last major release in which I saw him was "Vamp", and that was in 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but at that moment the torch Brat Pack had been Passed to others with straight hair and flashier resumes. <br /> <br /> I can not in good conscience recommend this movie. Just look at it to see a younger and idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasts with her soul.
