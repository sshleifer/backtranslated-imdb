Well, I'll start by admitting that I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I saw "The Informer" just because I try to make my way through a list of "greats"). So if you are, move forward, because you will not agree with me. <Br /> <br /> What a piece of stupidity so old-fashioned and outdated is this! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury him under excessive and cheap feeling. I guess it's interesting to watch for a while to see the less than perfect transition that was being made from the silences to the "announcers": the performance styles of some of the directors have that extreme quality from the beginning to the beginning. Movies and movies feel like they can play better with title cards than with spoken dialogue. (Of course, the title cards would prevent Ford from repeating each emotion six times). The dialogue that there is usually has a "They always want me! Lucky charms!" quality that is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that each actor has been allowed to use their own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful to remind us that we are in Ireland because most of the sets seem to have been dragged from some German expressionist piece that was filmed in the next sound studio. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, I could see some villagers shoot Dr. Frankenstein in the background). <br /> <br /> The techniques change. The tastes change. So I'm not going to let go of how crazy it seems that this movie has been so acclaimed in its day. But it's not one of the classics that they hold, but simply a "fair warning" about the kind of simplified malarkey that Ford was going to dedicate his career to.
