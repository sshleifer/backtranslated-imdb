A failure. The movie was not good. It has humor that children of 5 years who will not even laugh. I mean, of course, some parts were fun, but most of them are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and should be working on better movies. The film should have been broadcast like an original Disney Channel movie, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was done well with this movie was the music. Nothing like a rock soundtrack remade to brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. It's not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
