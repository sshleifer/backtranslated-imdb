In short, too long and full of more subplots than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-author says he wanted to mix genres, in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two are mixed like vinegar and oil. To start, comedy is not very fun and youthful. Also, the movie is not really realistic. They take liberties with respect to the legal system by committing French citizens against their will and the apparent ease of drug leakage in French hospitals. I saw this movie on my big screen TV at home and I found myself screaming at the movie to move on. Finally, towards the end, I quickly advanced the last and long speech that one of the main characters makes to the son of his former lover. By then, I was exhausted by the absurd plot that deals with a dead lover, a marriage of convenience and a former lover of the crazy. Sometimes, the plot is diverted to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them, either Ismael or mainly Nora. To the detriment of the audience, the views change constantly from Nora and Ismael, her former lover confined against her will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which is well developed. The epilogue does not really involve many of the secondary plots and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness, although given their circumstances in real life, the possibilities are equivalent to the possibility of a snowball in hell. . The actors do the best they can and are attractive, but this is not enough to overcome all the obvious flaws of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
