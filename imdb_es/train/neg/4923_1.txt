This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. This movie has nothing positive. Some of you like this movie! I've seen many Dracula movies and I've liked all the ones I've seen, but when I saw this movie I said to myself: "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula becoming who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then he felt so guilty that he hanged himself. You got to be kidding. That is the dumbest reason why Dracula became evil. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of shit this movie is. Whoever came up with this excuse for a movie, should be defeated. Even the dracula is horrible. If you ever saw this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is that title supposed to impress me? Do not waste your time or your money on this garbage.
