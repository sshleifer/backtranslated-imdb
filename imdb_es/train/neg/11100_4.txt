I loved the original story, I had very high expectations for the film (especially because Barker was excited about the interview), he finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The direction is everywhere, the performance was atrocious, the flashy images and the choreography were flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what about generic music video techniques such as fast forward and slow nonsense?) It had style, but not it's necessary in this film and I cheapened the vibe in a silent MTV music video Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). While some of the murders are pretty cool and brutal, some are ridiculously ridiculous (the Japanese girl's first death was very funny and Ted Raimi's death was stupidly funny). It simply rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense, moving away completely from the original story and then returning to the final that, at that moment, feels like a tack to ruin it even more. There were no explanations at all, I mean I knew what was happening only when I read the story, but for people who did not, it is even more confusing, since sometimes I did not even know where I was going and what I was trying. I did it all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and I loved the story because it has immense potential. for an amazing movie, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's movies as funny jokes, but this movie reeked of amateurism and stupidity from beginning to end. I did not care about anything or anyone, everything was hurried and severely cut. The real source, turning it into something completely different. Granted, it was bloody and Vinnie Jones played an excellent rude, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. Gutted
