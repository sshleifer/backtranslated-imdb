This movie has successfully demonstrated what we all know, that professional basketball players stink all that is not playing basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First of all, is it just me or is it the ugliest child you've seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry when, despite having magical powers, it stinks horribly to make music? Third, I have read the Bible. In no way did the form or form say that Jesus made geniuses. Fourth, what was the deal with all the special effects of shit? I assure you that any nerdy teenager with a computer with acne and acne could have better effects than that. Fifth, why was the ending so bad? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam must be thrown from a plane to the Eiffel Tower, because this movie carries the word "suck" to a whole new level.
