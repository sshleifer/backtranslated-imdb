The unashamedly ambitious science fiction of Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a work of love. Unfortunately it is not so good. Everything starts pretty well, with an epic but restricted score, a mix of the Lucas and Hitchcock style and the brilliant cinematography of a Spielberg. The film also makes reference to many science fiction novels, series and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. However, the movie is not as good as any of those for several reasons: the main one is that it is a love job, so worried about throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran really forgets to make a movie . movie. There is little or no tension, atmosphere or magic that is offered here despite the aerial battles, the dinosaurs and the preparations of the race against time. Even the noir elements fall flat. However, this is a broad way of looking at things; those elements fail mainly because nothing feels real and is so false. The green screen looks like a video game half the time and it is obvious that the actors have stuck afterwards. . The actors can not do much either: Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is squandered, and everything is due to a horrible script, the kind that has to explain almost everything. It's a decent experience and some may feel homesick, but ultimately, this is a meaningless step into yesterday's world. Good ending though.
