It is obvious that all the good reviews published for this film so far come from insiders who participated in the film or who know someone who knows someone and, therefore, have seen multiple cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's trash. The only thing that has to its favor is the ambition and multiple appearances of the legends of horror (none on the screen for a long time). It's as if the filmmakers made this movie a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to shoot scenes during their recesses. This is an ultra-cheap X-Files, with video recordings, with a terrible performance by a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; everything is a too explanatory dialogue that tries to explain an intricately intricate plot. The effects of the computer are a joke, but there is not enough of them or enough action to make this movie enjoyable in an MST3K way. After approximately 8 consecutive scenes of nothing more to talk about, you will find yourself looking for the fast forward button ... and without releasing it. Absolutely worthless.
