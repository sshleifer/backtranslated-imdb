Well, my God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the news of a new version of Robert Wise's 1963 film, "The Haunting," I was afraid it would be ruined by a lot of visual effects the size of a summer movie. But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and company will not ruin a movie, whose original was a fantastic and terrifying film that comprised the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now? My fears have manifested ... a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is amazing; The film is beautifully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do wrong once. But, the script tests the best actors ... asking them to offer the kind of forced dialogue that is only spoken in the movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only artist who escaped with some dignity ... and that is hardly. But, the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel that horrible fear of the fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to SHOW us from what we're supposed to fear ... and you know what? As beautifully realized as they are ... the visual effects become silly. And the climax is a phantom disaster ... but things had gone terribly wrong long before. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I'm afraid there are no real emotions or crunches in this old monstrosity of haunted houses ... just moans. Look at the original instead. <br /> <br />
