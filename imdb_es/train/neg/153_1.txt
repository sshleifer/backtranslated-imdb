"Spielberg loves the smell of feeling in the morning, but the feeling at the expense of narrative honesty? Nobody should love that." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" takes place in the deep south in the early 1900s and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African-American sisters. The film begins with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic refuge that is quickly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This reason ?? Innocence interrupted by men? permeates the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a series of short sequences. It is revealed that Celie has been impregnated twice by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, takes away her newborn son and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent thief who repeatedly rapes her, forcing her to cook, clean and take care of her children. <br /> <br /> All these horrible scenes are given little time on the screen and, on the other hand, they are surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography, symphonic music, incongruous comedy and an excessively exuberant camera work . The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney caricature and a rape movie, a discordant aesthetic that caused Stanley Kubrick to comment that "The Color Purple" made him feel so dizzy that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? Last long. <br /> <br /> It is often said that the film is about "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but this is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the film is based, claims to be bisexual, but in reality she is a lesbian closer. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which depicts men as violent brutals that hinder women. For Walker, the only way out of this labyrinth is for women to unite in a kind of lesbian utopia, black brotherhood and celebrated female independence. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's film, however, re-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity surpasses the natural cruelty of men. A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, misplaced comedy moments to make him look like a clumsy fool. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast composed of lusty men (always with devilish smiles and toothy smiles), fat stereotyped moms, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which black people are naturally children and happily and happily accept their social conditions. A film in which blacks have excessive sex, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class problems are completely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South derived from "Gone With The Wind", MGM Muscals, "Song of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Hallelujah!" and banned disney movies. In other words, it's the south seen by a child raised on a 50's TV. Everything is so caricatured, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that the black novelist Ishmael Reed compared it to a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion. The film ends with family ties being healed. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further by making all the characters in the story reconcile with their relatives. <br /> <br /> Beyond Walker's hate letter to black men and the strange caricature of Spielberg's black life, nothing of the black community is shown to us. We only have the vaguest ideas about how these characters earn their living and we have no idea how they interact with others in their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera jumps, desperately struggling for our attention (it seems that one of Celie's kitchen gadgets belongs to a "Home Alone" movie), all the emotions played, the director never stops to observe something or allow a little Of life simply happen. Combine this with the ridiculous "white" music of Quincy Jones, and you have one of the strangest movies in film history: an angry feminist treatise filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, scored by a black man who tries emulate John. Williams. <br /> <br /> The lack of white characters is also problematic. Consider this: the men in this film do not present themselves as rude to each other, nor dominate women because they are brutalized by a racist society that reduces their manhood. No, they are cruel by nature. And women, whether suffering silently like Celie or rebellious and tough like their sister, persevere and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it happens among the oppressed, but would have shown that it is social abuse that has led to marital abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the same tasks like their male counterparts (while still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that domestic violence in African-Americans occurs largely because of economic factors, women can not support themselves and only their children. Work here. At the end of the film, one character tells another that, because he did not respect his wife, she ended up being beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites crush them unjustly. That is, let's respect each other in their poor minority community and not oppose the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, innumerable sequences loaded with visually stunning strangers, incongruous comic book ventures, emphatic music tracks and a tremendously exaggerated emotionality, all contributes to the interpretation "The purple color" without value.
