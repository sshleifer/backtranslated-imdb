Terrible movie made with a budget of around $ 9.99. They used very obvious miniatures games, bad acting and a terrible story about aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (not enough to bother) and a character with an egg beater that replaces one of his hands. (Yes, you read it correctly). <br /> <br /> A salvation was a song performed in the "talent show" (how about that irony?) From a punk / new wave band that I think was called "I am a missile looking for heat" . Apart from that, this is not worth it, even on a level "so bad that good". See if he likes corny alien movies, but anyone else should avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 of 10
