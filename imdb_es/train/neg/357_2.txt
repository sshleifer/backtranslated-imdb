JUSTO CAUSA shows Sean Connery as a Harvard law professor, Kate Capshaw (does he still have a job?) As his wife (slight difference in age) and Lawrence Fishburne as a southern (and) racist police officer and Ed Harris in a performance totally superior to a serial killer of the fundamentalist south. <br /> <br /> Strange castings, but the movie plays seriously with the audience. (Do not read if you ever intend to seriously watch this movie or see it seriously because of the spoilers) First of all, I felt repeatedly rolling my eyes at the liberal stereotypes: the cops are sadistic and frame this. Black boy without evidence. The coroner, the witnesses and even the defendant's lawyer collaborate against him (he is accused of raping and murdering a young woman) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professor who gives passion. discourses on injustices against blacks and against the death penalty barbaric. The grandmother of the convicted man is approached to defend him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is stubborn (yawning ...) by the officials of the small town and the good children's club IL 'but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now in the corridor of the death, it was invented. The main evidence was his confession that was defeated from him. <br /> <br /> The beating was administered by a black policeman (!) who even played Russian roulette to get his confession. Connery discovers that another prisoner on death row really committed the murder and, after a few days with a serious oversizing, Ed Harris, in the style of Hannibal Lecter, discovers where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets a new trial and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... the movie is over ... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psychopath who used the "white guilt" to recruit Connery. He invented the story with Ed Harris in exchange for Blair committing some murders by Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is loose again, thanks to Elight's PC principles! The last 30 min. It's a weird action movie related to a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in a crocodile skinning house on stilts (yes, you read it right) in the Everglades. <br /> <br /> That was a weird movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are just Abu Graib thugs and torturers, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> Truly Depressing at all levels! The system is completely rotten and the white guilt types of the PC that challenge it are also seriously cheated. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something like that.
