Of course I've seen bad movies in my life, but this was so bad that I really got angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to return the ticket for the film, of course I did not receive a refund (not even an answer), but what matters is the point. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer) stop being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of breaking the skull of the ass? The plot was thin, the film was full of obvious clich√©s, and certain parts just did not make any sense.
