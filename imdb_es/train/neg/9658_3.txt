My God, what an amazing movie it is! It reminded me much of the similar scene in the Mel Gibson movie "We Were Soldiers" when "the Company is not lost, they just cut themselves" And the other scene in Pearl Harbor when the British officer tells Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you, then God helps the nation that goes to war with the United States! <br /> <br /> Collect the 3 films and you would have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara Desert. <Br / > <br /> The history of the Cutting Battalion may be real enough, but the film could have done it without all the Jingoistic and predicative American propaganda attributed to it.There were audible moans at the movies during the scene mentioned in Pearl Harbor ( no joke).) However, the lost Battalion is really in a class of its own. " <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are unbeatable" inspired by bravery. "" In fact, I shuddered and nearly threw myself up because of everything that had been thrown out during this diarrheal disaster (the movie that es) <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were well done (3 stars for that) but if the script is Manure, then wrapped even in brightly colored ribbons, it's still dung. The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote those other cries: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge. Someone, please, shoot him before he writes more garbage. <br /> <br /> The Director, Russell Mulcahy is also Australian. God, shame!
