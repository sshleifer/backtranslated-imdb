Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. The last movie was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a classic comedy. While the second part was full of a lot of old-fashioned humor and cheap shots, at least it was fun. There's nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, jokes and visual gags are supposed to be naturally fun. Hitting the spectator by the head with tired jokes is not good. The humor in this film was aimed at young imbeciles who will laugh at anything. When they attended the high school crowd, any sense of self-esteem was thrown out the window. The parodies of the rings are not funny. I have seen them in comedies since 1998. They are very outdated. The jokes of Michael Jackson are not great either. What is even worse is making fun of two who have been divided, the "artists" whose best days were NEVER. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been very slow. Movies like this are the nails that are being hit in their coffin. What happened to the real humor? I have not laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. Too many bad films rot the brain. Do you want evidence? Go to your local mega-video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe in the hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop instead of suffering this bad excuse of a comedy ever again. <br /> <br /> Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
