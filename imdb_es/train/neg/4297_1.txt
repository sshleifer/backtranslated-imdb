I wake up suddenly, aware that I'm drooling on the plastic cover of the sofa, and I realize it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Because I was sleeping? I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped momentarily in Cheap Seats while navigating the channel, and the surprising lack of humor and talent drained the force of my life with such speed that I lost consciousness. <br /> <br /> It's that Shake your head, openmouthed, shrug badly. But I have to give credit to these dumb and bored twins for selling this idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me, and when he / she woke up, some horrendous episodes were already in the can and I was hoping that since all the viewers will be asleep, nobody will know how horrible it is and he / she can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
