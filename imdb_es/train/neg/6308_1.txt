An outstanding for the content of this film, as a British I did not know that there was segregation in the United States Navy during World War II. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the performance is wooden and the script is just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I sat down and I cringed from the beginning to the end of the poor way in which it had been organized. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside the United States was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it was put together. It is unfortunate that a real story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low-budget, poorly directed film. I just hope that at some point in the future, one of the main studies will take this issue and do it justice.
