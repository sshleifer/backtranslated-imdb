The supernatural and vengeful police officer has returned for a third installment, this time acting as the guardian angel of an unjustly accused police officer. The standard image of the stem and the bar, but well acted and directed, which makes it strangely interesting and visible, although the violence is not for the apprehensive (especially the cut of the director who originally received a rating of "NC-17") . <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
