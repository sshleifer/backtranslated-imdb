After seeing this, I thought, there are very few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that is not fun, but makes you clench your teeth and shake. It makes you scream "this is wrong" in the movie. The immersion is zero. At this time, most of you are probably used to the terrible mistakes / oddities in movies that have computer hackers, etc. This movie is like that in all aspects. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the girl Emily, played brilliantly by Eliza Bennett. I hope it gets big and makes this ... at least worth it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not look at this There is not even proper action in it. Total loss of time.
