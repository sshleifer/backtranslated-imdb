The fatal failure of the orders, in addition to an asinine plot, is that the character simply does not resonate or react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest, who walks through a cemetery late at night, is suddenly attacked by spirit ghosts. After fighting them, he quietly resumes his walk when his friend approaches. "Nothing bad?" His friend asks, having seen the attack. "Only some demonic spirits, nothing I could not handle." No reaction, no surprise, as if a tire had changed. Your friend is not worried either ... it must be the standard priestly training ... ["And then you put the host in your mouth ... Any questions? Ok, go ahead, the Demon Spirit attacks ..."] <br / > <br /> Example two: At one point, priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something who cared now) could provide it. How? Well you have to ask a dying man! So the devil has a random person hanging in front of the two priests so that they can ask their question to the man who moans. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "That's not good!" It would have been more realistic than his response. They never ask that they let the man go or stop; In fact, the closest thing to reacting is a slight discomfort. They asked their question and left. <br /> <br /> I had to turn it off at that moment, my brain was starting to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star in four) <br /> <br />
