During the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a very attractive and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers of the program managed to keep the program relevant and not too "out there". <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more. That's a great joke and has absolutely nothing to do with business, at all. In previous seasons they used to put much more emphasis on business-related tasks, now the focus is mainly in the boardroom where participants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them in the program (that means lying, speaking badly, stabbing the back etc.). The boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at its lowest point: sometimes you wonder if you're watching a replay of an old episode of Jerry Springer. The tasks in the program are, at most, boring and, mostly, a showcase for companies that are foolish enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the deal on half of the participants living in tents in season 6? That's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have no respect for any of the participants this season, they all look like idiots to me. In previous seasons, at least some of the participants had a bit of integrity, now it seems that the participants would kill their own mother to keep them in the program. It also seems that Donald Trump's huge ego is getting bigger and bigger for each passing season and, to be honest, I do not see why someone with common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom almost does not make any sense and, sometimes, it seems he just likes to tear people apart for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, NBC, for the love of God, take out the air show as soon as possible. It is too embarrassing to see him. The apprentice was once a great television show, but now it's just a big joke.
