We entered this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of "My Favorite Martian". We had our 6 year old daughter with us. He wanted to leave in the middle of the movie, which was fine with his parents! The parts we saw were occasionally humorous, mostly too silly or rude. I hope this movie is attractive for children between 9 and 12 years old, if so. Definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I have heard, the original series was much superior and if you are going to "relive the past" you will probably be disappointed.
