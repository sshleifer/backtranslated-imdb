This is the case of a group of people who think they are so smart that they have a story that fits the moment. Do you remember the political conspiracies generally taken on camera in the years before Watergate and a little later? Most of the films that tried to take advantage of conspiracies made for television were so powerful, or therefore numbing, in fact they were caught up in their own navel-watching attitude. <br /> <br /> I was never a fan of The Conversation, which seems to me as antiquated as other conspiracies of the time, but Coppola was faithful to its main character and Hackman was a very attractive actor to watch. I mean, these conspiracy films are mainly drowned in the group of characters of the black heroes. Many unanswered questions, a lot of lack of communication ... Well, this requires at least Bergman to build a film on those non-visual bases. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a horrendous conspiracy that hardens his network around him. Neither side is interesting in itself and the whole does not improve. In fact, you can tell how much will be bad from the first sequences that accumulate 'watcha that' murders without advancing any story. At its worst, the pedestrian direction since most of the film is a pompous accumulation of scenes that revolve around the violence naively placed under the eyes of the viewer.
