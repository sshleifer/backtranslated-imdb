This movie is just stupid. <br /> <br /> From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fateful climax, the film is a predictable wooden exercise. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things to get to the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a tit by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get away with it. One is so badly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film are taken from the book of the Three Stooges. The dance of Velda at the bar, for example, or the bad boy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And interruptions in continuity are embarrassing: Frau Blucher is running along the centerline of the road when the camera is set on her lower legs, but it is very on the side when the camera is retracted for a wider shot. The worst rest, however, precedes the attack of popcorn. The bad boy who stalks Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except that the clock shows that he was seven minutes behind our man. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it should be seen, which is the only reason why you get two points of 10.
