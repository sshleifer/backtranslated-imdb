Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is his magnum opus, a shining example to the rest of us that it is certainly worth being nominated at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as indicated on his 1998 era website). Unfortunately, it is better to remain silent and think that you are a fool to talk and eliminate all doubt. With Ben and Arthur, you do just that. <br /> <br /> Apparently assembled with a lack of instruction or education, the script of the film guides us towards the truly strange with each new scene. It is this crazy excuse of a story that can also be the best ally of the movie. Starting warmly, the homosexual titular characters, Ben and Arthur, try to get married and go as far as to fly across the country, in the shade of the best Vermont palm trees. But, all this posture is simply an introduction to BLOOD. Then more BLOOD, and MORE AND MORE BLOOD. I mean, there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood makeup in the last third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a technical error. From sound to editing and music, which consists of a single diffuse bass note that is held on a keyboard, it is a wonder that the film stays together in any medium in which you see it. It's a shame that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures in this movie on rentals or whatever it is that drives poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we are not laughing with you.
