Now I just realized that by watching this movie I have lost valuable precious moments of my life that I will never return. This movie is not only poor, it's terrible. It reminded me of every stereotyped black comedy that has been made. <br /> <br /> I regret having seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia considers it a racial problem, apparently "white" people do not like it. Because he does not have white actors. Comrade, I think you will find the reason why nobody liked this because to see the painting in dry is much more entertaining and fun than this pile of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Please stop making crap movies
