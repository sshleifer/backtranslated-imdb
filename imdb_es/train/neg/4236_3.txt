Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a bit of modern psycho billy, then watching the live performances is almost the only thing worth seeing. This film has tons and thousands of cameos, along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-important role, and many scenes of absurd deaths. It sounds like it can be good, right? Well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different Warp Tour bands and fans of the event. Some of the deaths start with style, but then they are recycled again and again, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost all people die because they break their heads or remove their intestines from their stomachs. Gore looks like it's from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; being this the "blood type diluted", but now that movie is really decent and provides humor, something that this movie lacks terribly. Sure, the movie is made by Doug Sakmann of Troma, has great low-budget potential and tries ... but it's too difficult. Everything is meant to be fun in this movie, and that's what makes it fall. Everything is trying to be too funny and ridiculous, using a bad intentional performance, an excessive use of useless deaths and doing the same thing ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board", or any movie you've done with your friends: it's funny for those who made it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, great idea, great use of the effects, but it's the same ... again and again: a band plays, a band dies, the fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process repeats itself. <br /> <br /> The question is for this kind of movies, which is basically a "slap", do you try too hard or do not do it at all? ?
