I was so disappointed by this show. After listening and reading all the fuss about it, how it was an "innovative show" and all kinds of wild promises of quality, I tried to see it. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! The performance was very forced and exaggerated. The story had very little meaning. As for any hint of the acclaimed "look at the lives of teenagers," I could only see an insignificant attempt that had as much reality as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it is not really that good and the fact that the drums exceed the quality in this program only serves to draw attention to how badly it is.
