My thoughts on the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, it was not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the rhythm, the angles of the camera, etc. However, the characters? uh, a little bland. Plot? I stink. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed more trash of the new era than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not better represented. Create a monstrous weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Seriously? <br /> <br /> That's also something that bites my ass a bit. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they are using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us. At least they had the decency of one of the characters asking, <br /> <br /> "Well, now what?" (or something similar). I could not hear it too well because the crowd got up immediately and took a break to get out. It was a "well ... it was barely entertaining enough to sit here for the whole movie, but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!" type of output. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you can not think about if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the images and nod with grace. Any thoughts as to, "what is the point of that?" It will snatch you from disbelief and make you see the exit sign with longing. <br /> <br /> Well ... Follow the SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Then, basically, a scientist creates "the Machine" that is capable of creating another life, intelligent, robotic. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also lacking. He gave the Machine his intellect, but he did not give his heart. <br /> <br /> The Machine puts Skynet in the collective ass of humanity and erases all life on earth, finally turning off slowly. However, the scientist manages to survive and create puppets. Each, which contains a part of the soul of the scientist. <br /> <br /> The last one, # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets another one like him, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 is captured by a last robot survivor of the Machine. # 9 finds more like himself and is thrown to the rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 Note that there is a hole that fits perfectly to the device. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life ... taking the soul out of # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The movie continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to rescue their compatriots with the soul thrown away. <br /> <br /> Eventually they succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who rise to the clouds. Then it rains and we see that life returns to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> That does not make sense. None at all. Why on earth did the scientist want to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What did he achieve? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? <br /> <br /> Why did you expect nine little creatures to succeed when there was nothing else? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight against the first ... at least that would have seemed like a reasonable possibility of success? <br /> <br /> Why did they have to do it? Are their souls absorbed by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not wait for the machine to shut down and return life without the rest of the crazy steps?
