Why, or 'why! ... I picked this one up? Well ... I needed a truism in the summer heat, and the cover looked good. <br /> <br /> Of course I should have known better. This is a really bad movie. And it becomes embarrassing when the creators know it's bad, and they try to hide it by adding some attractive / beautiful women, and some sex scenes. Well, friends ... they do not cut it, they do it! <br /> <br /> If you'd like a great movie about a great reptile that is really very good, well-interpreted and fun: go Rent Lake Placid! (that's an order)
