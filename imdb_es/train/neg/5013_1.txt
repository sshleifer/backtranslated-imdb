I will not argue with anyone who says that this movie is execrable, as is the January Jones performance, but please verify it, if you have not already done so, on Mad Men, the AMC television series, which will begin at the end of this month. It's excellent. as is the whole cast. I will assume charitably that he assumed the role of "taboo" strictly for the money, and, realizing what was going to be a pudding, it became a minimum acting job to avoid hunger. I know if that is the case, but (now) I know for sure that she can act. <br /> <br /> At first, seeing "Taboo", she was convinced that her flat delivery was an astute choice that would then result. To some significant revelation about his character or the plot. There was not so much luck. It is hard to believe that the director did not suggest at least once that not changing the expression in 17 successive scenes could cause obstacles. <br /> <br /> Ironically, her winning performance in "Mad Men" is presented as a character that, at least in her first appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of herself, and quite colorless, not very different from its "taboo" role. But as the TV series progressed, it began to flourish in someone who questions his traditional role as a mum mum in the early 60s. I can not wait to see where his character takes in the second season. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "Taboo" like leprosy, but definitely check out "Mad Men".
