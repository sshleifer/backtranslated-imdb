This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, with The Gravedancers being the first. The gravediggers were better. I can only guess, seeing this, that the production must have been quite limited. I admit that the story started being interesting, but in the end I ran out. We really did not have time to sympathize or understand any of the characters, which made each of its erratic features even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of confusion with a 12-year-old boy who acted as Sheriff. The only reason I sat down throughout the whole movie was to discover what the big secret was, which turned out not to be that interesting. Some more background about the family would have helped, but to begin with, they did not really look like a family. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateurish that I could not even see it. on DVD The four ratings correspond to the initial potential that the story could have had. This was one to jump for horrorfest.
