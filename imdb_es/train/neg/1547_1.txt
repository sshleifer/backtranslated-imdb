I could name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that pretend to be funny, and they are. Some films, like a Gymkata, for example, try to be serious but end up being funny. The Ladies Man is a film that desperately tries to be funny, but it could not be less funny if it was a guy who has many girls in the middle of the remains of a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that I have laughed with more desire than to laugh at something in this movie. It's simply not funny. It's boring, stupid, insane, annoying, incredibly bad, but not funny. I do not particularly care about Tim Meadows, or this SNL character, but I expected something better than this. <br /> <br /> The film is completely lacking in logic or common sense. It's as if the writer had a bag over his head while writing and could not see which keys he was pressing. They tell the "origin" of the Ladies, but they do not include a motivation for their strange fascination to act as if it were still the decade of the seventies. The film tries to get the humor out of a man who seems to be pleased with pornography, shortly after trying to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider that I have a great sense of humor (I spent a lot of time writing comedy as I do), but maybe it's not bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in There Something About Mary, is outrageously bad here. I was begging him to shut up. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was banging my chair, muttering under my breath, and if the movie had continued, I probably would have tried to kill myself. It is possible that this movie is not as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it is the first movie I have seen that is approaching. <br /> <br />
