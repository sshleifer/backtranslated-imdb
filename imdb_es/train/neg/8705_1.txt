This movie is the worst movie I've seen ... it's funny how bad it is ... all the time I was watching it, I almost expected the music to start and the doctor starts dancing ... (I've seen porn with a best plot) When the raptor was trying to get in the door, I think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away. But like I said, it's so bad that you should see it so you can see how bad I'm explaining that it's not going to do anything compared to if you see it ... I do not recommend renting it, but if it's on TV Watch it for about 30 minutes to see what do I mean? I could not see more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit through the whole process, then you have good willpower.
