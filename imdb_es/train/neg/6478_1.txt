I'll say it again: this movie was totally boring. Children will like it, of course, but adults ... doubtful. Basically, it was a repetition of the original, which is to be expected, since they explored the concept in its entirety in the first film, but even so, did they have to completely repeat the whole movie? I mean, everything is made of the Little Mermaid. Worst of all is Morgana, the "crazy sister of Ursula", who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why did Triton not do anything about it? Because the plot required that I do nothing. I could go on, but I will not. All this is a shameless attempt to raise more money from the Little Mermaid, and obviously it was thrown without thinking, because they knew it would sell. In general, it is a terrible waste of time.
