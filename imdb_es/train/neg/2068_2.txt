Lou's Gospel was a big disappointment to me. I received an email from the theater that showed it as a great and inspiring movie. It was neither great nor inspiring. The cinematography was pretty dubious with the whole movie. Many of the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that I could not tell at times what it was about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were crazy. The relationship he has with his ex and his son is never made clear. Also, the whole movie has it more than one way, and then, suddenly, BAM is healed and inspiring. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is wrong in his life, what makes him live his life the way he is living it, but when he changes, he does not quit boxing, he teaches others how to box . Thumbs down.
