Someone has to send this guy from Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who told him he knew how to make a movie? Can someone make movies these days? In the past, a TALENT was always required before someone could make a movie. After seeing this bad movie by BTK and the others he made, it seems obvious that the poor man has as many businesses as I do movies. Actually I think I could even make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the killer of BTK, apart from the names of the victims and the murderer. THAT'S. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other foolish nonsense in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to attract people to watch his movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame he has achieved. Absolutely regrettable The only serial killer movie that I would consider WORST is that "DAHMER" movie. That boy smoked so many cigarettes that it made me nauseous. Whoever did that needs to be shot.
