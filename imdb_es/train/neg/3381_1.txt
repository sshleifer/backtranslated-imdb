This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater, almost every shot and every moment sounds fake. However, I will say that it is bad enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably dated. For my life, I can not understand what it means (conceptually) by opening the film with the exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" is being played. Should we think that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line", which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? Oh no, the program is collapsing on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do this?
