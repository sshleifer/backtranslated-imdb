I remember seeing this in prime time when I was about 7 years old. At that time I was a great reader of comics, and everything related to superheroes was anticipated to a large extent. The final result, however, was disappointing. <br /> <br /> I knew the stories of "Diana Peel" Diana Prince, as they had only recently come to an end and Diana returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I got bored during most of the movie. The final suit was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the film again in my last years of adolescence. It had not improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's amazing, but her performance was not better. The script had some good ideas, like the roguish Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalb√°n, but it just did not come together and it was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the Best Story backing, and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like an insipid spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic. The elements of the Amazon were intriguing, but they had to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film was successful in forcing the producers to return to the drawing board and propose something more faithful, albeit a bit exaggerated and with little budget. The budget was also pretty low here, and the superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, just as a comparison and a historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and has nothing about this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's worth seeing for curiosity and for a little inspiration and caution for future versions.
