<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits in, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but quite slow. However, I was especially disappointed in the end. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on Earth you run to your uncle's house (?) Without at least calling The detective or the police first? She knows exactly what is happening at that moment, and also has a video tape as proof. Instead, he runs there and starts to go crazy and says "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect tests, right?!" Then she is surprised when her uncle gets up and starts walking towards her as if he was hurting her. Well, DUH! Of course it will hurt you idiot, you just told him that you know everything and that you have proof to expose everything. What a silly ending.
