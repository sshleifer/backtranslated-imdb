In an attempt to recover the teen slasher genre that was removed by skits like Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why do people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond what has been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher movie that barely has any blood. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend that it's not funny. And the moment the killer appears on the screen, you know who he is, it's predictable sssssssssssssssooooooooooooo. The slasher genre for teens is DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
