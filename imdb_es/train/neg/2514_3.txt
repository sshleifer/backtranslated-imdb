I loved Dewaere in Serie Noir. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers", also known as "Going Places". Well, it's a couple of guys who flaunt the convention in the most absurd and irredeemable way; Many people find such behavior fun. This was a boring, meaningless exercise designed to impact. I find the smile on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoyed. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere jumping on the abandoned ground, we have an idea of ​​the amazing and beautiful antihero we will spend time with over the next two hours. When we see him chasing the unfortunate middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places," we have a warning that the two hours spent with these children will exhaust the soul. I have trouble getting even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
