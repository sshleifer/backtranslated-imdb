In an interminable session of three hours and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a beautiful but superficial comic soap opera from India that gives us six interconnected romantic love stories (which are at least four stories, in my opinion)) . <br /> <br /> Shot as a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer ad, the film is a mix of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy dancers, songs and high-level dances. numbers, fantasy and dream sequences, winks to one side of the characters, cheesy dialogues and comic performances around the world: all this is a fairly standard issue when it comes to the events of Bollywood these days. It's an exhausting task to simply try to keep all the characters straight while they dance, swoop in and make their way through the incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> There are many things for the viewer to enjoy with his eyes here, not least, all the beautiful women dead, but he will need Job's patience to help him get ahead.
