Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they occur in the context of a movie that does not seem to have a clue what it is doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this, all the music takes place as a realistic interpretation. Suddenly, about an hour later, the characters who, up to this point, had always talked to each other, suddenly begin to sing. To confuse things further, a little more inside, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of full dialogue, then they seem to abandon that idea and move on to other things, like a number that starts at a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly become a fully orchestrated piece with a huge section of invisible strings. Above all this inconsistency in the way music is used, there is the clear inability of composers to write music in the style that is supposedly being represented. While the first couple of pieces mimic the Motown sound of the 1950s, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway music. Then there is the sheer stupidity of the fragments of a group that makes a bad imitation of the Jackson family and that Eddie Murphy transforms from Little Richard to James Brown, to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder, I could not help but laugh out loud. This was clearly one of those movies that make me appreciate the little time I have on earth and it bothers me that I lost two hours watching this movie.
