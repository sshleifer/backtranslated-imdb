The movie had a nice opening, I really thought I was in one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time ... there was something "strange" about the way the movie was created, realistic but somewhat abstract. and mystical But then the line of history began to become increasingly unrealistic. To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be a euphemism ... The most typical romantic ending where everything goes well for each "nice" character. A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and pursues the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of spectators. Come on. In the end, the 'good guys' win, the 'bad guys' loose ... You get an idea. A waste of a potentially interesting movie.
