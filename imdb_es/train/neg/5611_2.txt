Personally, I found that this movie was terrible, first it was not very objective and it provided a side of the debate. The only people who were presented as the side saying he existed were a group of people who came from a Billy Grahm Renaissance. Secondly, he deviated greatly from his supposed subject where Jesus existed (Yeshua), to talk about how violent Christianity is and to show scenes of Mel Gibsons "The Passion". In the end, he has the director with his former director of a conservative private school to interview him, and tries to catch him for teaching the faith to the children. Oh, and also Techno music just made the movie harder to watch.
