I loved the first movie of "Azumi". I have seen Mrs. Ueto in a variety of her television appearances and I have seen my fair share of samurai and ninja movies. I must say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the distribution of the film and its configuration in "Azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie. , but instead it was slow, laborious in parts, and punctuated by a very poor, unconvincing and wooden performance. <br /> <br /> When they bothered to make reference to the first movie, they did it in a rather vague way. and weak In "Azumi", the title character is the best of a group of superior assassins. In "Azumi 2" she seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it was a total loss. There were some decent fighting scenes and some exaggerated characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers in general for the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really captured the "manga" feeling in his script, while the first never "understood" it.
