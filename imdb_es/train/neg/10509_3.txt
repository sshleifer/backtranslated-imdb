Expelled from the sky, a gang of naked and horny women's angels (with large plastic fangs) have settled in a spooky forest where they feed on the helpless souls that should walk. Is not it long before a group of friends on a road trip fall victim to the bloodthirsty? A low budget independent horror made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and eliminates it with some of the worst performances, effects and direction I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Does director Johannes Roberts show any occasional style behind the camera? The scenes in the house of Lalapidad are quite tense and there are some moments of "shock" handled skillfully, but for the most part the film is technically amateur. Include some really horrible performances of the horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you will have a really bad movie in your hands. <br /> <br /> Part of the fun can be derived from the absolute evilness of the film, and there is a lot of female nudity for the boys to enjoy, but most will find this as a chore to sit on.
