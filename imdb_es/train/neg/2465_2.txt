This would be a mediocre Hollywood observable if it had a good edition. It is based on the typical American thriller plot: "who is going to be more cunning than everyone". The performance is below average, but with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and is the main responsible if the tension in the film increases. The movie was completely stifled by blank video and sound footage and most of it looks like raw movie material. In short, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student's film project, this is a movie to watch. I guess it would be enough to say it in this movie, everything else could spoil the tension that is probably low enough.
