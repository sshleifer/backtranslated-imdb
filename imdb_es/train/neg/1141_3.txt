Taking into account the low expectations, the new initial images (timed in more than five minutes) of 'Husbands' were a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new footage was Grade A, but it provided a very solid foundation for what "could have been" a completely original good movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1955., during a scheduled shooting time. After the new recording, Jules White decided to simply capture the archival footage of 'Brideless Groom' in this short, to make a not so smooth transition of the story, that Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a little bit faster of new images in the end, giving us the old and worn end of the boys (Moe and Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt. <br /> <br /> 3/10
