Well, basically, the movie blows! Blair Witch meets Sean Penn's misconceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the "War on Terror" is really about. The script looks like it was written by an 8th grade student (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors act excessively throughout the film; They used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (not that I know anything about those things, but they do not look like the real documentaries I've seen), and the worst of all is that Christian Johnson took a great idea and He did suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a really bad stick figure that looked more like a giant poop. I'd rather see Blair Witch VIII, than go through that again.
