I am surprised to discover the amount of fans that this program has. I did not say that Friends was, at best, an "average" situation comedy, and not as good as others have done it. Let's face it, if it was not for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, who knows if this program would have lasted as long as it did. I doubt that very much. Although as the series progressed, the Friends became more predictable, boring and boring that I did not care about the characters, which are more overrated in the history of television, or its difficult situation, or who was sleeping with who. And it went from being fun in the first four seasons to being occasionally fun. And even when I had all these Hollywood actors from the A-list of the film world, I still did not bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stagnant and I lost interest in this program after the sixth season and in the end. Well, it was predictable to say the least. <br /> <br /> The annoying thing was that it lasted ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons, for example, and finally they were canceled and taken off the air forever. The program should have stopped immediately at the time the cast wanted higher wages. In truth, as much as the series faded, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was very relieved to see the back of this situation comedy. Now, we are talking about a friends meeting program that will arrive on our TV screens very soon. And, however, I will not be waiting for you at all.
