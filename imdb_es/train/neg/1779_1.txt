It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of the cat people, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This work could have been just that; Wonderful and full of mythological references that kept my fascination fueled. The main characters (Charles Brady, played by Brian Krause, and his mother, Mary, played by Alice Krige) were made superficially, lacked personality and were not pleasant or drawn. Not even the character of MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) fits that description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times before, when you adapt a Stephen King novel for television, you should simply keep in mind the fact that your books are not written for television and your script. The talent unfortunately lacks the fire and depth that exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another failed attempt to take the magic of Stephen King's writing, either from his novels or from an original script. To simply cut and paste your work on the small screen. His novels become completely bastard in the process and everything you end up creating is a good movie; Nothing less, but certainly nothing more. His scripts are unpredictable. Unfortunately, this script translation was an error. <br /> <br /> Movie Sorry, Sorry, Sorry. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1.0 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
