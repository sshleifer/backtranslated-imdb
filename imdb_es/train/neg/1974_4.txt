Some people have insisted on discouraging this film because they question the plausibility of blacks in the Old West, Asians in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Hold on and read a book. There were a lot of Asians (Chinese), enough blacks (freedmen) and all, outside the Gentile class, had easy access to arms; It's the second amendment you know. And with regard to the use of modern language, none of these Western people has been nostalgic for the use of a language that was consistent with the era described. Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different rate and used many words and phrases that today would be unrecognizable. Do not blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you simply did not discover it. Be honest. Maybe you just feel uncomfortable with what you're seeing.
