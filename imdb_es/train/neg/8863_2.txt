Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 of the first film. While the first movie was corny and spooky. The second was of poor quality and corny. The production values ​​in this case are quite bad and the performance is atrocious. The brother of the werewolf of the presenter of the first part wants to find out what happened to his sister. The "scene" of the first movie was badly recreated. A skinny, smooth-looking woman accompanies Bro '(Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to discover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a kind of wise / guide of the two. Sybil Danning and his two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the main werewolf of Romania. She also suffers from a bad morning face case, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There's nothing good about this stinker. I am surprised that Philippe Mora has directed this image because, in general, he is a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that it needs a flashlight to see it (no, not the content, but the material of the film itself). To round off the movie you get a bad "punk" interpretation from a damn aspiring "Babel". Maybe if they had shit a couple of extra dollars, they could have got the real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid unless you are desperate or lose the remote control and are too lazy to change the channel.
