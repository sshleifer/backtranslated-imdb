Alone In The Dark is a bad movie and is tied with Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish it was EVERYTHING I had to say, but, of course, the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that. <br /> <br /> I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is worse kind of bad movie. A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Hands. Or a huge budget misfortune like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos because the director has no idea. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid idiot who takes money and simply does not care about his audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking if you consider that Uwe Boll (The brain behind this shocking shit and already has some real trash under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The horror movie really terrible. Everything is a disaster. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera cuts and a frightening soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible movie that should not be seen by anyone. Woo hoo! Review about. Give me a cocoon, do it in 2006 and I will NEVER talk about this again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
