<br /> <br /> This movie stinks. Ridiculous "school" environment, incredible students who are very bad and behave like criminals, but later, after the "good teacher" Nick Nolte taught them that they became as good and calm as kittens. <br /> <br /> If this works for you it is not for me 0 out of 10
