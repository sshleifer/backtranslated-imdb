It's funny, when you stop and think about it: fans of scary movies are inclined to a deep and constant affection towards those who scare them. The CHAINSAW MASSACRE of Texas can give us nightmares, but who among us (the Faithful) did not feel a very real pang of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE or for Ken Foree, forever and ever the determined hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and applaud (like Tom Savini's cameo); It is not a joke. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you understand my course (if not, just stay on the wind ...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. Seeing this many of them together in one movie is almost unheard of (at least up to this point, as far as I know). If only the writer (s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as it's not another half-effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
