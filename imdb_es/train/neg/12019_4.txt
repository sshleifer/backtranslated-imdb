I read a couple of good reviews in this forum for "Mr. Scarface," but for anyone who is not initiated into the genre of Italian gangster films like me, the image probably does not make much sense. In fact, after the initial configuration of the ten million lira scam, the image became a fairly routine revenge with a small twist on the character identity of Rick (Al Cliver). The entire plot of the gang war was muddied by the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most viewers commented, he is the only one who brought this image to life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. It seemed incredible to me that the Manzari thugs who chased Tony through the streets had not really backed off before Tony even lent them a hand. Despite all his accumulation as the title character, Jack Palance was unceremoniously wasted in an almost anti-climactic ending, making the work title of the United States, "Mr. Scarface", quite debatable. I've seen enough Spaghetti Westerns to know that not all work; I guess in this case, my first glimpse of a spaghetti gangster movie did not make it either.
