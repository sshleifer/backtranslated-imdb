People who really liked Problem Child (1990) need to have their heads examined. Who would take the idea of ​​seeing a malevolent child wreak havoc on others and consider it fun? The movie is not fun, never, in any way, from beginning to end. He wants to be a caricature, but writers do not realize that the slapstick is not funny when people are attacked by bears or beaten with baseball bats. It can be fun in cartoons, but not in a movie. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver), who, since he was a baby, has been placed at the front door of the foster parents. for adoption. Families reject it, because Junior tends to make them have a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes the nuns, and writes correspondence letters to the damned Bow-Tie killer (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child, to be like any other father in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family, and "Little" Ben is interested in him, even though he destroys a camping trip by attracting a bear to the site, or throws a cat to his father "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), an intolerant politician. <br /> <br /> I think we're supposed to take care of Junior to be able to encourage him when he takes revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl who despises adopted children is a spoiled brat. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last one Laughs are not funny, they are bad, cruel and, sometimes, threaten life. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the movie? That children should solve problems with violence and vandalism? What should they look for friendship writing to convicted murderers? They definitely do not know what it is to be a bad boy. Junior is not one, he's just a sadist, little twerp. There used to be a time when it was bad for children to hit others. Now, everyone laughs when Junior hits the children with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a "family comedy". What is worse is that the problem child is rated PG. What was the MPAA thinking when they saw this? Here there is a lot of malicious and malicious jokes, that one can wonder about the division between the PG and the PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will enjoy this, but parents will be surprised at what is happening. represented on the screen. And for most people, Problem Child will be considered a classic of "guilty pleasure"; a film that somebody will admit shamefully that he likes, although the predominant opinion, as presented by the most serious viewers, is that the movie is a piece of shit.
