It's not a terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Also, they do an acceptable job with the script very weak. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Also, I understand why these actors and the team made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. But I wonder why the studios spend the time and money to make a movie and then they do not release it for the theater audience. Even if a movie is a box office failure, it surely makes some money. If you are a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent the video or capture it on TV, as I did. Of course, the film will not help solve the immigration dilemma with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of the standard. Today's television rate.
