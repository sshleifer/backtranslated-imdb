Well, it's hard to add comments after reading what's already here, but I feel like I should say something. I was not exactly looking for "a splash feast" as someone says or even "blood and guts / blood". I feel some respect for the relatives of the victims, although I really felt that the filmmaker DID NOT. - They are anonymous, faceless and meaningless. Only one boat for the sexual pranks of the Dahmers. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think: "What makes a man a serial killer?" besides asking me the details about Dahmer's story, of which I know very little. The people here seem to think that the film did not have to cover the events of Dahmer's story. I.E. his story, what happened when he was caught, the consequences, etc. But it is important! You see, I suppose if you're an American, you KNOW all this. We do not all live in the United States. To tell this story about a man like him was obviously, REQUIRES that at least SOME of the story and the actual events are told / shown. This does not mean blood and guts, there are ways to show horrible things in a movie by implication or intelligent filming without resorting to gore. Without even touching something he did (I discovered more about him reading the comments of the users on this site!), The film felt like a vacuum. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about the REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction, a VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, the strange representation of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of ANY attempt at completion, this movie is POOR. I would not recommend anyone to waste the time necessary to see it. Definitely 1 out of 10 (for the performance!)
