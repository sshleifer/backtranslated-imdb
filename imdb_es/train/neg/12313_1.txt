This may or may not be the worst movie Steve Martin has ever made, but it was certainly far from being his best movie. Obviously, he did this shit for the paycheck. Dreck like that does nothing to improve his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to understand is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie, they expect to be entertained, they do not get bored to tears. It's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not understand the fact that people do not want to see them in terrible films. If you're going to call a comedy movie, then it should be funny. This was not embarrassment to the United States Army for allowing itself to associate with this pampa as well. Full Metal Jacket laughed more than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy". Surely, Phil Silvers is circling in his grave.
