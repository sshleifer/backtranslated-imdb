This is the kind of movie that everyone involved should be ashamed of. A bad direction, an exaggerated performance and a plot that rambles without any other point to show violence. When I saw it for the first time, I thought it might be a satire of the media and how it shows violence, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone does his worst direction ever. From scenes in which the face of Woody Harrelson transforms without reason or in the terrible performance of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, a reporter who seems totally crazy, this movie is simply a disaster.
