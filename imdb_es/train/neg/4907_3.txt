Yu ¿¿¿¿¿For the most part he did it. There were some minor differences (location of the last violent scene, for example) but not many and for the most part the film stayed true to the book, more than most movies. <br /> <br /> This may have been a mistake - although the film was perfectly molded, especially with Pollen and Bellows, I was not so impressed with the book. Or let me take that back. I started very impressed, gradually I became more disappointed and in the end I was completely dissatisfied and felt almost gypped. There is no difference with the movie. Here is why. <br /> <br /> There is no "reward" in the book, or the movie. I rarely read a thriller that did it, that created such a disappointment with its final resolution, and I expected the film to vary a bit. <br /> <br /> The whole- (he did, NOT she did, they did NOT BOTH) was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing than anything else. Add to that, that the love of Lindsay's life dies in the end (after HIS illness recedes and she cries in her grave) ... and then go to where she's thinking about committing suicide ... then, suddenly, she's in a fight for his life with the villain REAL who was acquitted after being arrested ... but it turns out that he and his wife were together ... HELLO! All this has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old-style thriller. I felt cheated and scammed by the book and watching the movie (I must admit that it caught my attention very well, the performance was very good for a television movie) I hoped he would not follow the book he ended up doing. <Br /> <br /> I still think that the movie can be seen and, for some reason, it does not leave a taste as bad in your mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen) But I must say the way the unraveled story was not well done at all.
