This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. This is saying a lot, considering some of the decisions I made in the movie rental. <br /> <br /> I got it on Netflix based entirely on the fact that someone with whom I went to high school has topless. . The topless scene lasted about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was as fun as having cob sticks under my toenails while forcing me to listen to Roseanne singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "They are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and costume gags, and it's such a shameless (and poor) scam by The Kentucky Fried Movie that you'll beg Big Jim Slade to crash into the Wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever it is). <br /> <br /> Unless you're a masochist, avoid this pile of garbage.
