A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken to the jungle. They demand a great ransom for their liberation. Peter is hired to take his house to safety and there is a bonus for him if he can return the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack. They try to give fake money to the kidnappers in exchange for Laura, but the plan goes terribly wrong and they have to rescue in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have to be rescued from that (it's not going well until now). Also wandering through the jungle is a class demon. Actually, he's just a naked black man with strangely large eyes and a breathing problem. He begins to kill some of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the movie is a bit fuzzy really. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a big fan of Jess Franco, in fact to date this is only the second movie I've seen, but I can even say that this really is not one of your best efforts. Movies creep at a fairly slow pace without anything happening at all. Everything could have been edited quite easily on a 25-minute television show. There are a lot of excessively long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have got up directly. <br /> <br /> The Demon Hunter is poorly lit (Infact I do not think it was turned on), badly bent, badly acted and slow, but for some reason it did not bore me. I think the main reason for this were some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. For example, a scene in which Laura is walking on the street was obviously filmed on a real street when crowds of people stop to look directly at the camera while shooting. Another funny scene has one of the members of the gang that has been killed, hanging in a tree that drips blood while one of his friends is just below him screaming for what seems to be minutes. Then, for no reason, the man at the head of the trees falls down and hits the guy underneath him. It has to be seen to be believed. Then, of course, there is the real devil. He is just a naked black man who, despite having huge eyes, has a very blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The movie got caught in part of the video, a horrible alarm in the 80's here in the UK and it was banned. Now why do not I have a clue? There is very little blood and it is not a shocking movie. Less nudity would have said that he could almost get away with a PG. The only thing I can think about is that it was never actually seen and added to the original list due to word of mouth. <br /> <br /> There are not many reasons to see this movie really, unless you are a massive person. Jess Franco fan. There are a lot of nudes to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad that you can laugh at them, but I would say that you only pay a ticket to South America and you get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
