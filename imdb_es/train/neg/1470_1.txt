Last night I was looking at our DVD tower in search of something to see. We were among the NetFlix emails and it was a quiet Saturday night. I took out one that I had never heard before and I realized that it had been taken from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a scam of "The Big Chill" but, with the cast of stars, he felt it was worth seeing. Chico was wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was a scam almost character by character. The character of Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been all this time" on the paper) -saying warning- and, here he stays to take care of the old place (hut / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; the womanizer idiot Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I'm even seeing these people. There was not enough character development for me to find any interest in them. How "Unca Lou" found these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even funny, except when Perkins fell, he missed 'he fell on the bed' the first morning, it was a signal and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife: "Was there any endearing character in this movie? ... Are you sleeping there?" She replied: "No, I'm still thinking ... No, I can not think of any."
