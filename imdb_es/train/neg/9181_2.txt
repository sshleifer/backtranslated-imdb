Generally I try to be professional and constructive when I criticize the movies, but my GOD !!! This was the worst movie I've seen in my life. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, all bad! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenage clich√©s on their way to a rave (which takes place in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to discover what happened to the rest of the party, the clan undertook a mission through a forest infested with zombies. During this crusade, they are helped by a police chick and a ship captain who, by chance, has the right amount of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically, the rest of the movie is a collection of misdirected action sequences that include too long a shootout outside the "house of the dead". This fight was completed with the cheesy violence of Hollywood, the redundant clips of the HOTD videogame and the rotations of the camera in matrix form. One of the character's volunteers even sacrifices himself to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face was marked by the acid that a zombie spit on him after he continued to hit the creature long after it had been disabled! Am I supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To summarize, it does not make any sense to watch this movie unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted to see this piece of sh * t could easily cover the costs it cost. GRADE: F
