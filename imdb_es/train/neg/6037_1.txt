Moron and his girlfriend perform some ritual to resurrect the dead, in an attempt to prove that the dead can not come back to life. It is not surprising that they raise a dead soul that begins to cut them with an ax, and the next day some people of college age are telling the story around a bonfire. The guy with the ax appears and starts hacking the idiots who tell the story. The group calls the police, the policeman sees the blood splashed everywhere and thinks he is a mountain lion (!?) And shortly after is killed by a deformed assassin who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Mor√≥nico A small splash film that was filmed in broad daylight, but where several characters carry lanterns and talk as if it were the middle of the night, and they wanted to send a signal to get attention. A man has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other, but he does not bother to load it, then, after he finally loads it, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer, but he does not bother to do it, because that would end the movie. too early. Then he throws the gun away! They are also harmful to characters who show no emotion and do not worry in the least after their friends have been cut into pieces and have had a terrible effect (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car exploded at the end it was clearly a car model) and the horrible dialogue and some really ugly female nudity does not help. And in the end, he tries to get away with his incoherence by saying that it was all an invention of the same people of college age who tell stories of campfires at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer actually appears in the last scene that cuts them to pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre of its kind, good only for some involuntary laughs. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
