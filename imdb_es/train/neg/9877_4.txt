Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson directs, and respects, takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a feature film. Although I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, did, the film seemed to have been lost in his own intelligent spirit. Anderson seems to have left history behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this were a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I'll leave him alone. I admit that I had an intelligent and pleasant spirit, and that the animation is nice, but the film becomes increasingly difficult to leave, leaving behind the story and having random images of random things that are happening. The characters are good, too. Jason Schwartzman expresses Ash, the intelligent son of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), and above all, he is attractive. The film does not reach a level of terror, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it progresses. I'm sure Wes Anderson will come back to the track with another amazing movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie of yours was a big disappointment.
