Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra-low-budget film tells a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a madman who receives a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend bitch. He starts taking orders from the wrist to take large amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts as a movie of exploding balls to the wall, stays that way, but becomes VERY repetitive VERY fast. I am leaning more towards certifiable madness. Although it is difficult to forget it once seen. Something like if Tom Green once made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell is completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows boobs and bushes <br /> <br /> ANTI-candy: watching John completely naked several times
