I lost 5.75 to see this fucking movie, so I just want to know some things: <br /> <br /> What was the point that the dog split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing what to see? with the division in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed? She had already totally infected her room, they could have locked her there where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why would the hermit run through the woods asking strangers to help him when he could have asked his relative, the little pig, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why did not he? If any of the characters bothers to go to the city to get help when things start to get worse, are they all really so lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by the guy with the shotgun for spying on his wife, Paul could have sent Jeff or Bert home to ask for help. The girl he loves is deteriorating. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the box? <br /> <br /> Why Jeff went back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected, if he was such an idiot to leave in the first place, would he not have returned home? <br /> <br /> If the police had taken the trouble to gather the children and burn them in the pit fire, why did they throw Paul halfway to the river? It was not even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade with river water, that shit has dirt leaves and bugs in it Why the two kids could not just use the tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid would it still work?
