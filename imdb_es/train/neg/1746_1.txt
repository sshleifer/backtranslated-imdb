Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> There is no argument. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Full of silly and senseless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and without direction. There was not an appropriate end to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping center. <br /> <br /> The same story chewed again and again until you want to say "please, go ahead!" Even the song and the dance were meaningless and badly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were enthusiastic bodies everywhere ... but most Bollywood movies have that anyway these days. <br /> <br /> By the way I'm not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
