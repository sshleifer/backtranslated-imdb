I had very low expectations for this supposed "reimagination" of the original, and they were not even fulfilled! What were you thinking? (Answer: They were not). Please, do not waste your time at this Hollywood garbage festival. Trim your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything other than see this. Remember: if you rent things like this, you will only make sure that they earn more.
