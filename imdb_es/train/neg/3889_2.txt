I always wanted to see this because I love horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not. I mean, the acting was entertainingly bad, the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed for all the main actor, so I should have loved it. Unfortunately, it is really risky between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. That's how boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> However, if you like bad movies, you will enjoy the dramatic output of Fat Nurse and the stellar performance of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he has to present some incredibly inept lines with a serious face, like the conversation he has with his wife about how to locate IM Man: <br /> <br /> "I'll find him with a geiger counter" . "Is he radioactive?" "Only a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, your plan fails when you find a lot of gobs in a tree. "Oh God, it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I'm so glad you clarified that. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm making this movie sound pretty funny. It would be if it lasted only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude simply complains about making a mess when I should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were really drugged, you would probably love it, just do not have pop-tarts during the movie, because the main actor really looks like one almost at the end.
