This movie is really ONLY the interpretation of Bill Maher's religion. There are several funny moments and some interesting points, but do not get involved in this waiting for an impartial discussion about religion. This is what I consider the worst type of documentary: everything is arranged in advance and in edition to provide the opinion of the director, instead of allowing him to make his own decision. <br /> <br /> EDIT - It is very clipped, spliced ​​with pop culture clips and the media to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has the opportunity to finish a sentence before it is interrupted by the edition. The only people who have a fair chance to say what they think are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, they are edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWS: they have the purpose of representing the most absolute extremist religions. From Evangelical TV to the last Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (seriously, a TRUCK STOP chapel). He chose the worst money collectors, the heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say no. And when he gets a good person to interview, he edits them to hell. <br /> <br /> ESTEREOTYPING: all religions are described as stereotypes. Especially beaten are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, it hardly gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting them himself, or by editing in pieces with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as armed extremists through editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly. <br /> <br /> FINAL - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy-handed, and although it is an interesting idea, it does not fairly present itself to countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while the clips of destruction are reproduced in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in the religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the faults of the film, it has some positive points and the humor, although very unfair, is really fun. But we know that entering, is a very partial point of view, of Bill Maher, of religion. He is not discovering anything. He is telling you what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good moments, but with a heavy hand and an extremely irresponsible documentary style.
