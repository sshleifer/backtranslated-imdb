I refused to see this when it was originally aired, treasuring the memory of the late and sorry series of the sixties with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. It is not a new version, and more a parody than a tribute, this program did not know how to play it, and it was filled with children's comedy, cartoons and characters. The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a direct role). The supporting cast were simply known comedians of Vic and Bob who wanted to be part of the joke, and too aware of the situation to be convincing. And the CGI, although the effects could not be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier, simply dazzled the viewer with the work of lights and cameras, and did little to hide the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and no substance. (And while the 1960s show makes fun of most of its time, this "update" is now also very outdated, with "Matrix" style fashions, obligatory "female power" scenes and little subtle tension between two living beings.
