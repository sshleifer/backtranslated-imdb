I did not like this movie at all! In the first place, I do not know why, but everyone here is saying that Clémence Poésy's work is excellent, which, in my opinion, is absolutely incorrect. It's not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she's an inexperienced actress and that's why she could not play this role! It completely disfigured the heroine! That was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man, who had not shaved for 2 weeks and had defeated a battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie there are some actors whose work was incredible. Alessio Boni did his homework very well! I was pleasantly surprised, he is one of the few people who has read the book, which is very important for the work, and I liked the plays of our Russian actors, that was really wonderful to see them)) The only thing I liked in this job were the very beautiful views and the amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the real meaning, the purpose with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps understand the complete idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
