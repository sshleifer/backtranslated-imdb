I think this could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are fine ... but in general it's a B movie The same thing about the plot, the parts are fine, but it has several holes and weirdnesses that do not add up. Acting is mainly good, I have also seen worse things. :) <br /> <br /> The beginning establishes the level, the cars circulate in the desert, making "great" but totally unnecessary jumps through small dunes (in slow motion! Great!), like the Drivers had never seen sand before ... It gets a little better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you rent this, get another one too and use it as a warm-up. Keep expectations low and it might work for you.
