I had not seen the trailer of the movie when I went to see the movie, but based my judgments on the opinions of a friend. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie falls flat on his face. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Rock offers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the film lacks comedy. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and in that effort it fails. The love story in the film is simple (fortunately), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and bland. After all, the film is, first of all, meant to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. There's not much of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is not interesting in general either. Some parts were completely discontinuous. If the cast was meant to be fun, they certainly did not do a good job. The pair of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and boring. The pair of subordinates of the first incarnation of Rock was also insipid. However, if there is something they did well, they made Rock seem more fun in comparison.
