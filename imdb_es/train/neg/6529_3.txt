This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost gave me an attack. Despite what they imply, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and they used it because it disguised the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. Nor do I think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for laughing, if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days with $ 200,000. It is entertaining; At least I can say that about it. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
