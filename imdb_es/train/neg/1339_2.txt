A sad and sad sight is the revenge of Munster. The Munsters are brought back for the last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this movie made for television on a couple of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman who are robots that "terrify" The city in preparation for a robbery of a mummy's cache in a display. With the police on their heels, the two elderly television icons try to find out who is really behind the crimes to clear their names. We got to see them disguised as waitresses (a minor high point in the movie), the grandfather turns into a bat with a cable attached a couple of times (once even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles, I suppose), and a more annoying relative "the Phantom" constantly sings and breaks showcase and nausea! What is sadder is difficult to identify: it is that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so emaciated in each scene and so indifferent to the material. Are the disguises of the robots that have the production values ​​of the school? Maybe it's the ridiculous script. Sid Caesar is crazy, mostly without funny clowning. Or maybe it's seeing something that brought me joy and good memories when a child received a makeover from K-Mart. In any case, the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even by Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is suitable in the empty role (although she shows more cleavage than usual for a woman of her age and experience). K. C. Martell makes Eddie Munster always affable. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks, acts and speaks in the most absurd way. The movie has a really cheap feeling, even for a movie made for television.
