My girlfriend once brought The Zombie Chronicles to see it as a joke. Little did we realize that the joke was on her for paying Â£ 1 for it. While watching this movie, I started thinking about things I would rather do than see The Chronicles of Zombie. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drink bleach 2) Rub the sand from my eyes 3) Write a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Recreate the American Civil War 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old woman. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka sergeant. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was to knock down a door (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never a movie has had so many mistakes. My girlfriend left him here, so now I live with the shame of being the owner of this shit. <br /> <br /> News just in: Owen Wilson saw this movie and tried to commit suicide. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK
