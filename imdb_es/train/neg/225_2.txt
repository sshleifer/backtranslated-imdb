SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is expelled by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of his two malicious girlfriends. Kate thought she had caught them in flagrante delicto. Kate pulls Jed's shoes out the door. Jed leaves reluctantly, and then sits in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then it is run over ("Crushed", one of the meanings of the title) by a truck. And dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he's hit by a truck." Can you imagine a scriptwriter sending a script with this element of the plot? Until then, it is a comedy that claims to be frothy, but that has no real effervescent effect. Everyone except Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and all are sad, until the end, where the girls learn to love each other and be supportive, instead of destructive. I give you 2 ugh's.
