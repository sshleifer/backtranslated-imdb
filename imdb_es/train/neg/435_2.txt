An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and a few other things before the '80s. To hide that you have no idea what's going on in theaters these days, launch The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same quirky discourse of cinema as art again. This speech is reduced to common and obsolete places: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is adorned with the cheesy effect of having edited Zizte in the movies he is filming. For someone who is supposed to know a lot about movies, his is cinematically speaking: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words: I saw 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most absurd things I've heard. At no time of his wandering, the incoherent response was close to something that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is more foolish now for having heard it. I grant you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul.
