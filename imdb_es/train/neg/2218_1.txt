I admit that my criticism is from a 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after the making of this film and at the moment of its conception, it could have been a brilliant film of suspense and terror. <br /> <br /> As of Halloween night 1968, Michael, 6, commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his hometown to murder again. <br /> <br /> From this point, it is clear that the film will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. . The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music of each scene that contains Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the film, which alerts the viewer of possible events to follow . <br /> <br /> For the horror / suspense enthusiasts, there is a great lack of blood / blood compared to the movies of today, although I am not similar to the amount that is currently shown. A happier means could have been found. <br /> <br /> Since half an hour in the movie, no scene is unexpected. The performance for a horror / suspense movie is quite typical of the time and, therefore, lacks force for the enthusiasts of today. <br /> <br /> A positive aspect of the film is the persistence of camera shots and dark lighting that creates a frightening effect. atmosphere. A second positive aspect would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues about the likelihood of where the story may lead. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the childhood stages of his acting career and, therefore, does not provide a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to describe this film as it was in its day, but from other horror / suspense films in fact In the 80s and, to a lesser extent, in the 90s, it is far from being a Horror movie / suspense really great. <br /> <br /> I suggest you continue and find a classic from the 80s. Cheers!
