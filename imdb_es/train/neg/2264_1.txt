To begin with this review, I must say that I had, I suppose, some curiosity about this movie ... However, I probably would not have seen it if my arm had not been twisted. <br /> <br /> In In my opinion, this movie shows how depraved man can be. In my opinion, the worst of all this Springer phenomenon is not that the type of people in the "Jerry Springer Show" act as they do (which in itself is reprehensible), but that many people are so curious and excited see them. and to hear about their lives (yes, I guess that includes me, to the extent that it is true). If we are not glorifying that kind of behavior (as some would say), at least we can be subtly corrupting our minds and / or deviating from this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soap box (more or less). Here is the skinny one: the film has a grade of R, and while it may deserve just that (I looked away in some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel an NC-17 (tip of the hat for the other critical) could be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the movie was just a great excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very strange, uniting the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotyped blacks that will appear in different Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves one with some rhetoric, and Springer's rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (evidently as seen through his show). I agree with him there: it is important to know what the world really is like so that we can look for a positive change. Having said that, let me tell you: the pretty bad picture of the world in a newspaper or the news to see that, but we should not disburse good money to support the kind of sensationalist coalition and perhaps formula that Springer seeks to give us.
