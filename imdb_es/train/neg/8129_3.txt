Sometimes I do not know ... you try and try to be charitable with all the movies from B to Z, but once in a while a particular movie tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is one of those movies. You can not see this without thinking that it really should have been an episode of "Night Gallery", and not one of the best ones either. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is bitten by a bat and, consequently, begins to transform into a Were-Bat that drinks human blood. (In fact, one would think that if he were turning into a real bat, he would be eating mosquitoes next to a gallon bucket, but since this is a cheap and spooky horror movie, the word is blood). Despite the fact that he has great bad attacks in the blink of an eye, and blackout episodes almost every night, his friend and medical colleague, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists that he is only having one " allergic reaction "to rabies vaccines. Meanwhile, the most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff in the world suspects that the doctor is responsible for the brutal murder and bleeding of several local girls (and a wino). Meanwhile, too, the doctor's wife decides that the denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately sponsors and annoys him to distract him. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that the acting is bad: you can say that the actors are making professional level decisions and they are trying to give some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. . (It's OK, it's pretty bad, but it's bad in a professional, wooden, professional way). It's just that everything about the performance, the way the scenes move, the costumes, the dialogue, the script and the story line in general puts the teeth on end and makes you want to slap everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I think the film had the outside chance of being a spooky and disturbing little cult favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor of characters, with a chair Until Pataki agreed to ACT, and not just channel Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) I also needed to find a script that made a bit more sense about the entire "Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns In A Bat" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more believable in the stage business for his 'episodes', instead of going to Little's "Man Has A Seizure" page Golden book of clich√©s acting idioms. <br /> <br /> 4) I needed to rework all the character of 'wife', make her smarter, less shrill and more observant. <br /> <br /> I would never see this movie again voluntarily, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", however.
