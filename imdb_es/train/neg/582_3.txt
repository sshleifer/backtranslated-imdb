Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and knowledge about human nature, in particular the nature of addiction, which still resonates strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to going around and around and spinning around, making the viewer quite nauseous. The reason why the director did not stop this exceeds me, but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failed, to get good performances from these normally excellent actors but in an inappropriate way. In short, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or rereading) the book.
