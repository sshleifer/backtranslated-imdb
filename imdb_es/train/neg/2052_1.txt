This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added, apart from the flashes of Perry, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary sensation of the first film and the great urgency that made it so effective. The lack of the Quincy Jones soundtrack that was added to the original movie is also painful. I can not understand any high rating for this at all. It's pretty bad. Why does someone waste time or money doing this shit and why did I waste my time looking at it?
