Seeing Josh Kornbluth 'acting' in this movie reminds me of my first-year television production class, where 'it's not funny' had the chance to show how unattractive they really were. <br /> <br /> Obvious is the word that comes to mind when I try to synthesize this comedy of aspirants. The jokes are sophisticated and telegraphed. The delivery is painfully bad. OH!!!!!!! The writing is simply silly. It's similar to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a Saturday Night Live sketch of an hour and a half (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I want my money back!
