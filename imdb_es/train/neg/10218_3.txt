** Spoilers contained ** <br /> <br /> I had heard from several sources that this movie was controversial and that the end in particular was horrible. What I did not expect was the complete change of tactics with about twenty minutes to go. What begins as a typical western cowboy / Indian suddenly descends to a very boring romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Crest (Candice Bergen) escaping from an onslaught of Cheyenne's cavalry. Most of the film then focuses on these two people who do not match, hence the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then appears and kidnaps them both for no apparent reason. They then escape and both rise (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack at the base of Cheyenne. As Cresta used to be married to one of Cheyenne's bosses, she escapes from the cavalry base and joins them. So far everything ordinary. Then comes the end. After enduring more than an hour of bad acting with a clich√©, they will come together and not join in the story, the film becomes a superior exploitation that includes, among other things, a beheading and a child who is shot in the back of the head. You can draw similarities with the Wild Bunch at this point in the movie, but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone and did not resort to extreme gratuitous violence. Somehow, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, who also completely changed the tactic for a shocking ending. I did not hate Soldier Blue nor did I find the ending particularly disturbing, but I found it quite boring with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a movie with a truly disturbing massacre of innocents, I would recommend Come and See by Elem Klimov.
