With a title like "Attack of the tomatoes murderers!" Anyone entering this would be waiting a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. It is supposed to be a mixture of both, with a dose of spattered parody. Unfortunately, it collapses very soon. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I realize, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? I discovered that only some of the jokes were funny or situations (ie, telephone conversations, the Russian Olympic steroids spy who ate cereal, Superman walking with Lois, etc.). "The attack of murderous tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but fails. A cult classic is a film so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). The "Killer Tomato Attack" can be enjoyed by any 8 year old boy with a bad sense of humor, therefore, it does not qualify as a cult movie. <br /> <br /> There's a good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin and ungainly reporter, but she has a charming personality, loves to exaggerate and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, they misuse it here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Murderers Tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "Women of the Moon in the Amazon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but I do have some funny moments, so I still recommend seeing it once. Avoid the cut of the director, have interruptions by the producer of the film and some images supposedly "lost" folded in an apparent African dialect (can be found in English on the tape exhausted).
