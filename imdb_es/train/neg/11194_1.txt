The next attractions of "The Order" make it look like a horror / horror thriller decent, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be excellent, all together to form a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and terrible special effects. The performance was not something to be proud of either, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled it well). He saved the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For the love of God: YOU DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
