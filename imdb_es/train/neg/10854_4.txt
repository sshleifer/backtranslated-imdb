Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a film where our delicate and delicate little narrative occupies our attention. This is not a movie in which special effects are supposed to leave us in suspense when we emit that sensation of whoa. What it is, however, is a portion of low-fidelity gothic horror that leaves little to the imagination, created in the eyes of the director, Alex Chandon, as "a throwback to the sordid 70s and 80s of horror". <br /> <br /> This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours, where four lines of weft are connected through a lot of watery blood, reams of body parts and dismembered guts, tied by an intestinal thread of revenge. <br /> <br /> The provider of such horrible violence is Dani Filth, lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, who plays a role he was meant to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new in wanting to carry out an occult vengeance. In this particular context, a condemned sexual predator and murderer, Kemper, the father of our devilish avenging angel, forces his son to exact punishment in those who are somehow related to condemning him to purgatory in an asylum. <br /> <br /> What this provides for Chandon, who should be congratulated for writing and editing this piece, is the opportunity to let his sick mind run freely. It seems that he delights in the idea of ​​splashing blood in the holes of those on the screen, and in all the nooks and crannies that can be reached. We also treat the close-ups of the skull crush, demon rape and other varied images to involve those who enjoy approaching their horror. And for some of those who follow this type of film closely, there is a strange sequence that can make you think: "I just saw what I thought I did", because, of course, Pretty Woman is not. It reminds me of some of the gore festivals created from the Italian horror about 20 or 30 years ago, and a series of other works where the disgusting images have left their mark, but not the context in which they were seen. <br /> <The story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ​​obsession can eventually lead to death in the search for violence on the Internet through the "Room of the sick", where the user has control of how you can extinguish a life. Other recognitions should also go to a soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent, and an effective use of drums and bass, which is often overlooked in making movies as a viable form of visual images. The use of the city of London as a backdrop with real people, unlike the movie add-ons, also adds support to the feeling of command of the film. Okay, it may not be, but the blood, the guts, the intestines, the occult and the demons in a somewhat perverse way and without problems is.
