If John Waters had written and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit on the head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed." It's a little entertaining for the first half hour, but then it slips into a kind of constant glop of constant screaming and people doing things to the genitals with electric knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad at whatever he is doing in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most of the spectators will not take long to forget it.
