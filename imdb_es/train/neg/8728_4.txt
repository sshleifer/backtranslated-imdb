This is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary. A series of crimes, the murderer you do not see in the whole movie, the classic investigations. And also the classic tale about a policeman who realizes what is happening and nobody believes it, so he has to fight only to reveal the truth. Not too much in this. Voting: 4 out of 10
