This movie is probably the worst movie I've seen in my life, surpassing the previous and dreadful movie "Spawn of Slithis", which I saw when I was about 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Bad Acting, diaphanous and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot, scenes badly cut, even the music was annoying. Did I leave something out? Well, the special effects were not bad, but CGI does not make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I spent money to watch this movie. If someone has the contact information of Hyung-rae Shim (the director), forward it to my username "in gmail" and I will contact him to request a refund personally.
