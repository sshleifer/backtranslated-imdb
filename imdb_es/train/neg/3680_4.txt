I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 6/18/02 to be exact. I fell asleep, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the south of Jerusalem and I saw a column of smoke rising from a distant point, the vision of the smoke was followed a minute later by the sirens. I remember hurrying to my room, I took out my binoculars, ran back to the kitchen and saw the image of a broken bus. The bus was still near the collection station where a terrorist boarded and with a single click on a TNT device, he killed 25 passengers, many of whom were driving to the school. The wife of a good friend of mine sat on the bus in the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I am sure that every Israeli has at least one terror. related memory that he wishes he never had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about it. As it turned out, the film was about to become a repressed memory by itself. <br /> <br /> The film is about a play-writing in a dry career, Haim Buzaglo (played by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) who spends most of his day performing initiation contests with your blank word processor page. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to write an article about a former army officer charged with debt. Buzaglo, bored and a little paranoid due to what is known medically as the syndrome "what on earth this hot baby is going out with me," he asks a private detective to watch his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As the detective As you progress in your investigation, your observations are permeating the work and, later, the lives of your actors. Meanwhile, the work metamorphoses from a comic work into an accusation against the isolation of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the film becomes a frenetic editing exercise, integrated into its little cardboard characters and unreliable dialogues, while moving away from the subject that was supposed to be treated in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard characters" I mean the characters that, under the writer / director's obsession for a "significant" movie, lacked genuine dialogues and any reliability. I will not elaborate much on this. Suffice it to say that I am sure that barefoot and homeless prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention of seeing a work, that is. <br /> <br /> This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of a trilogy of the current agenda. I sincerely hope that the other two films are derived from experiences like the one I wrote at the beginning of my criticism, in opposition to the isolated world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is not at all convincing. /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a milestone in austerity. It was filmed in ten days, the whole cast worked for free and the total cost of the film was approximately $ 12,000 (no, I did not omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). It makes you wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete Blair's witch project.
