Although a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, it's better that you skip this one. I saw it on TV, so I did not have to spend cash to do it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite credible, they become increasingly unbelievable towards the end. It is highly questionable, if an experienced soldier like Lieutenant Waters disobeyed direct orders. And even if he would, if the rest of his platoon would. They know that he puts them in direct danger, and they know that they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the heck, he is our lieutenant, so let's do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, there are some nice scenes in this movie. Somehow they save a town, where the rebels massacre the entire population. Well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest was already killed. The strange thing was that they took the trucks left by the rebels. They prefer to go on foot. Maybe because the roads are not safe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what made the movie the only point I gave him. <br /> <br /> What made this film an insult to the brain and, therefore, it is completely incredible that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without injuring or killing themselves. Only near the end lose a few comrades. And that's just because they have to fight against an army of almost 500 or more. You can believe that? <br /> <br /> They fight against an army of so many, kill hundreds of them and only lose some of them. And they have rounds and rounds of ammunition. Never stay without that. Grenades and claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do you get this? Carrying it around or what? They even got a laptop that shows them the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts several days. Really? Who thinks this shit? <br /> <br /> I suppose if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a group of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves you time.
