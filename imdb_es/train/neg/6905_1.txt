The Polynesian male cliches drink, fight and make a stream of sexist comments, stupid and without grace. The real-life Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl did not look or act Samoan at all, she looked more like the white female who has sex with someone on a whim. With stories as weak as water, you can not say anything about acting, even the most brilliant actors could not do anything with this script. It is sad to see the Polynesian actors willing to interpret such sad stereotypes in a film that does not have a good scene, and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of money from Kiwi taxpayers, what a missed opportunity to make a great movie about a vibrant community. It is better not to make movies if they are as bad and meaningless as this.
