I am an actor, producer, director and what I am going to say are facts. This project was the worst movie in the history of cinema. From producer to director and the editing of this so-called movie is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why Blockbuster threw such garbage? I take my job very seriously and this movie is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think so. I've seen bad movies of Zombies, but this takes the cake of Coffie and everything in the damn table. This movie sucks! I really hate to speak ill of other filmmakers because I myself am one, but consider it when taking on a different profession. I respect the fact that you completed a movie, but I have to ask you "WERE YOU SMOKING?", I mean the makeup of your girls, the terrifying Zombies, what were you thinking. To the whole nation, if he had voted Zero, he would have done it. The worst movie in the movie that makes history
