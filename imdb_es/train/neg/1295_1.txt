This is seriously one of the worst movies I've seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie: Asano is an excellent actor and the plot was immensely attractive. but I could not find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes an eternity when nothing happens. and the effects that the director used, such as the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion, simply increased my growing discomfort due to the fact that the plot was so slow and the actors were excessively aggressive. Much of the boredom was the result of strange additions that were completely unnecessary, like an hour spent in an asano walking the statues of Buddha and proclaiming that he does not worship anything. This did not add anything to the plot. A Japanese film partner and I were constantly checking the time. We could not believe that this movie was as terrible as it was. and the end was horrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for having managed to sit through this, but unfortunately he was wrong.
