The eight Jean Rollin film that I have seen is also possibly the rarest; The intriguing plot (as it is) initially appears to be too flimsy to support even its 84-minute cut, but somehow manages to be overly confused as it goes! An aspiring vampire (with little clothing, as promised by the title) is in captivity inside a remote castle and emerges only to 'celebrate' with the blood of the victims (who apparently are members of a suicide club) As if Not sure where this would take all of this, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain? Actually the perverted father of the blank-faced hero? Ridiculously revealed as a mutant (?!) of the future! The languid rhythm and the dreamy atmosphere (cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered child) are, of course, typical of both the filmmaker (as on the seashore in the climax {anti}) and The "Euro-Cult" style, such as the group of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the funniest thing about the whole visually appealing but intellectually empty affair was seeing the family actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in Luis Bunuel's films of the last few days) come up perplexed from time to time!
