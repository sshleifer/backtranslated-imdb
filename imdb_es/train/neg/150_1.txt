Real friend !!!! Where have you been the last 20 years, this is shocking in all kinds, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh. If you want to see the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Immortal Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can not compare, it gives you bad reputation, bad acting , bad script, etc. The total amount of money and free time, I've seen many movies, it's like horror. My favorite of all times, I'm really speechless, I have nothing more to say that, please, do not make the effort to see something so silly, please understand
