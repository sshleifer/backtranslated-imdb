There are many different versions of this, floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unclassified copies, otherwise you may be missing some blood and a nudity scene. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut that I saw has the title on screen WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintains the original US release title WITCHERY for DVD release. It's a pretty impression and it seems to have all the images, but it has some clipping / aspect ratio problems. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two releases of LA CASA were actually the first two films of EVIL DEAD (renamed) and the third of LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is better known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make things even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released in other places like GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. Ok, I better shut up now. I'm starting to get confused! <br /> <br /> Regardless of the title, this is a very successful or lost horror effort. Part of that is good, part of that is not. Actually I was in this movie during the first half, but in the end it became a pointless disaster. A large empty hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the scene, as several people are selected one by one by a German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Witch Light", and his girlfriend, the virginal writer (Leslie Cumming), who studies witchcraft, are in the hotel without permission. Along with real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who is showing the property to prospective buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Your children are also accompanied; the pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and her very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as the overexploitation architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at that time). Once everyone is inside, the driver of his boat dies (hangs) and the boat disappears, so they are trapped and basically at the mercy of the "Lady in Black". <br /> <br /> So, what can you expect? find here A lot of unpleasant things! One of the characters has sewn lips and then hangs upside down in the fireplace and slowly roasts for the rest of the cast. There is also a crucifixion, witches who eat a dead baby, a swordfish in the head, someone burned, a possession, a Sesame Street recorder, the virgin who is raped by a demon, veins of boys that bulge and they explode thanks to the voodoo dolls. and some other things From a technical point of view, it's a good looking film with a pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good bloody effects. The environment of the hotel / island is also quite pleasant. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross seem to have fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Although people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he is not bad in his role either. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, in spite of all the gore, the film seems somewhat boring and becomes monotonous after about an hour. Supernatural themes are confusing and confusing, too. When the characters are dragged to the witches' lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers decided, imprudently, to superimpose the screaming actors on a silly-looking red spiral vortex effect that looks extremely cheesy. And the witches' lair itself is empty and has an economic design with unfinished wood. And although the majority of the cast is at least decent, some of the performances (especially the "actress" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the boy) are so bad that they constantly distract.
