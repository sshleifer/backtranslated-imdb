Western society has received ideas that India is a poor country. Movies like these only make those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. Okay, there are poor and homeless people in India, but why is there no representation of educated people if not of those who are successful? <br /> <br /> I completely hated the idea that the film represented Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa. In my opinion, this movie has shown India in a very bad light giving erroneous notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly the reason why people ask me: "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so that we do not have to walk on roads so full of filth and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion about contemporary Indian society should see "Monsoon Wedding".
