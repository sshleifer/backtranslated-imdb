The original is a relaxing watch, with some really memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst of the DTV sequels, is completely devoid of spark. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical World, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical world, although slightly better, still manages to make a mess of history. Among the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and I personally believe that Jaq and Gus's antics are the merits of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, about how Cinderella gets used to being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were at their best here. The worst of the vignettes, when Jaq becomes a human, is sometimes cute, but lacks imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also pretty. The problem was that I could not imagine Anastasia being Cinderella's friend, since she considered her the meanest of the stepsisters. This was also marred by a rather ridiculous plot about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> The incidental music was very nice to listen to; however, he hated the songs, they were not really inspired, and they did not look like anything to them. beautiful melodies inspired by Tchaikovsky from the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella, although she still cared for her, had lost her sincerity and much of her charm from the original, although she wears some pretty clothes. The Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, like Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, the mice were the merits of the film, since only they contributed to the tenderness of the film. I have to say that the animation is also colorful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> In general, a cute sequel, although not original, that was marred by the songs and the lack of a story. 4/10 for mice, voice acting, animation and some pretty dresses.
