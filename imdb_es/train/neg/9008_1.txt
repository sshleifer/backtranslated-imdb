There have been a lot of unknown films or bad reviews that I liked a lot. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was oversized and I used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and it took most of the movie to get going and then it left you wondering "is that all?" Once I decided not to take the film too seriously and see it from a purely corny point of view, it became more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have ended in MST3000 if it was still on.
