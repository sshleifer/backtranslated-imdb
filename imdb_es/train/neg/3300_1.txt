Quite typical of Swedish films of this type. As strange as the performance was so bad, these actors usually give a good show. The casting was badly done, it made you wait for something (I will not tell you what). The main character was horrible ... I do not know where they found her. Anyway, get away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen", this is a Swedish action that is paramount.
