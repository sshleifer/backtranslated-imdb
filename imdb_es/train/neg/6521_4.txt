I'm probably not giving a good shake to this movie, since I could not see it all. Maybe if I had seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I could have appreciated it, but for me it is too slow. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot have disappeared from memory. This did not help the film, as it is something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is really four linked movies, or a movie in four parts, and I think it was the intention To be seen for four nights in a theatrical presentation. I discovered that Part I was nice enough, but it was all I could do to sit in Part II, which goes on endlessly. To read the philosophizing of Tolstoy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, your brilliant writing far exceeds any problem you may have with the rhythm of the story. In the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie that I saw. It is very striking, with a lot of work from this camera that draws attention, instead of serving to advance the story. <br /> <br /> Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just could not muster the enthusiasm to increase parts III and IV.
