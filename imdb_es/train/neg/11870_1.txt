This is the most depressing movie I've seen. I saw it for the first time as a child and even thinking about it now really bothers me. I know that it was established at a time when life was difficult and I know that these people were poor and the crops were vital. Yes, I understand all that. What I find hard to take is that I can not remember a single moment of light in the whole movie. Maybe he was faithful to life, I do not know. I am pretty sure that the performance was excellent and the direction and quality of the filming, etc., were wonderful, and I know that each film can not have a happy ending, but as a family movie it is serious in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to entertain themselves with a movie. I can not emphasize enough how this movie affected me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories flooded again. I think I would have everything but the ruthless scope for Prozac.
