a very good story, good emotion ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... I'm sorry to say, but a 1 in a vote ... that's what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley could have a better ending ... but maybe next time time :) all this blood without gore sense at all? the end would raise the story to about 10, but not ... the end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not boring and when they go to see a movie, they want a good ending, even if it's intricate ... but the only one lame here is the end ... I'm sorry
