This movie is horrible. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a family from a small town in the mid-60's. The father, the principal of the school, is going through a crisis of middle age. Enter a beautiful teacher from the big city who begins to challenge the minds of her students with some things that make you think, how to think for yourself. The director does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect the points. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder, aspiring Frederick Tara) is fed up with the lifestyle of a small town and wants to live. She receives bad advice, comes out with some bad guys and apparently family planning was not being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has worked mainly on television, this film is presented as a more adult version of a special program for after school or a very special episode of one of the most mundane comedies.
