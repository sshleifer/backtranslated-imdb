A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less content, which will allow actors, writers and directors to have more creativity. <br /> <br /> But, why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This film immediately assumes that we are deeply committed to the characters. Nobody is given a proper background story, so we never know why the characters act as they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations about physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one. to the left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie and that I thought it was horrible. <br /> <br /> Your question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save him?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save him."
