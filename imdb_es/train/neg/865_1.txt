I had the misfortune to sit for 102 full minutes of what, in my opinion, is this surprisingly bad movie. It fails on almost every level; The cast is horrible, the actor acts, in the best of cases, and the plot lacks depth, which makes me feel violently apathetic regarding the outcome of any of the complicated narrative lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B does not have any charm. This genre has the scope to transmit and I found myself physically shrinking in the various points where the script makes its wrong meanders in any place towards the comedy region. <br /> <br /> An authentic film coated with saccharine from a film.
