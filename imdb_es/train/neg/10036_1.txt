At some point I do not understand what the directors think when they make a film ... I had a trauma after seeing Welcome (2007) and I thought that they would not do it again. But after a lot of incredible promotions, Tashan finally ended up as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Such 3 amazing songs in the promotion - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, a lot of acrobatics of Akshay Kumar and nothing interesting apart from seeing Kareena after her great weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> When it comes to music, another big disaster ... in the music album, they have spent time giving small pathetic dialogues from these 4 pranksters and have not thought about giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts ...! That song is so beautiful, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to see this movie, I would say, watch it to listen to the background song that says something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointed even! With the way Bhaiyyaji has tried to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away, man, I need to throw up!
