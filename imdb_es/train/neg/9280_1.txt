Honestly, I do not know what is more fun, this horrible remake, or the comments in this forum. The Masterpiece review made me cry, that's very funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst movies in history and, of course, the bottom of the barrel for the sequels. The name "Omen" in the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap on the other three, especially the original one. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who is on fire from the juggler at the psychic fair! Good times ! This movie is for the Omen series what "Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.
