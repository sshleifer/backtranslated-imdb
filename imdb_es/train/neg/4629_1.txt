Obviously, it was made to show the famous talented "actors" of the 1950 stripper Misty Ayers. Too bad I can not act. <br /> <br /> A small and boring story about the sweet and innocent Sally Down (Ayers) who was drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets Tommy Cole, who falls in love with her instantly. He wants to help her escape, but can he? You really will not care. <br /> <br /> Here there is no real skin, Ayers simply takes off her underwear SLOWLY (twice). The rest is just a boring little story full of bad acting, atrocious "comedy" (I never thought that prostitution was fun, but what do I know?) And a terrible post-nickname dialogue. I admit that there was a turn at the end that I did not see coming but that is not enough to go through this. Ayers' attempts to act are also hysterical! A real bomb Avoid.
