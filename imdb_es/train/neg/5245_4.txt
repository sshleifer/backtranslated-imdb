I am a current A.S.L. Student and I was forced to see this movie in class, and what I got was the brazen slant involved in the movie. The film is obviously inclined towards P.O.V. The "perception of the common deaf" is not a middle ground. In addition, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also in debate on this issue. THAT IS TO SAY. Deaf people who were born hearing and then went deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? The film is skewed and practically all in the opinion of the deaf with a capital "D". It is not that this is bad, but to be a true documentary film one should try to be a little impartial.
