Apparently, most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and all of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Age of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten tests throughout Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why were not Americans, British, French or Soviets accused after the Second World War? There were no American, British, war crimes, etc.? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn, and so on. The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (It was also the title of a book in the United States, 1941). <br /> <br /> This film is a horrible and ignoble American brainwashing instrument, full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudices and injustices. And above all: full of hypocrisy. But it's not surprising ... Why was not the Nuremberg process itself enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and the lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq, etc. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would become envious of it ...
