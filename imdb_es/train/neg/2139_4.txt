I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a bad movie with very few laughs. <br /> <br /> The policy is right, it will offend the Republicans, but for that it is designed. . That just gives me reasons to laugh. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it was done in a REAL hurry (like a week). And it contains a stupid secondary argument about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely out of the question. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with which the United States has been fucked since then. the 50s. The humor is a little dark (amputees dancing with prosthetics made by the Tamerlane corporation) but it IS in the brand, especially with the corporations that are taking advantage of the reconstruction ("light democracy"!) <br /> <br /> However, like Much satire that criticizes the United States, it seems terribly hard and laborious. I guess it goes against so much bs propaganda, so you have to hit people in the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer a push-and-wink approach, a bit of subtlety. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could see it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope that "W" is more in the mark.
