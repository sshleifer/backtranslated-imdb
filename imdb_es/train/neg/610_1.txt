I bought this movie at a low price in a sale, after having read the back of the DVD box and assuming that I can not lose anyway, if it was garbage, then there is no loss, if it was good, then negotiate ... <br /> <br /> Then I saw it ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he ordered very little screen presence, seemingly not doing much, even the death of his friend near the beginning, what triggers the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is simply boring and not very dramatic. <br /> <br /> Normally a film that has themes like Big as the revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and catch them to feel something for the characters, however, seeing this movie felt more like watching a series of confusing and almost random events that were linked together for their eventual conclusion ... <br /> <br /> At this point I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was the piece Most horribly painful visualization I've seen. He has not submitted to the scene in which the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out of the truck loaded with explosives because he does not want to kill any civilian. Tragically sad, as it is extremely horrible and painful, although not as bad as it is. Emergency surgery on the injured girl. The performance was deficient in all aspects, the script and the story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visual elements" were, but bluntly, not so visually. In short, there are movies that are good, movies that are bad, movies that are so bad that they are good, movies that are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then, on a whole new level, it is "McBain "
