I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986, it was criticized by the critics, and I'm talking so badly that Eddie Murphy's brilliant career ended more or less, so I think this movie has something in its favor. <br /> < It has a bad start where Buddhist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on their face. Bad boys enter the temple <br /> <br /> The child sits with a blank expression <br /> <br /> Bad boys cut the monks <br /> <br /> The child sits down with a blank expression <br /> <br /> The bad guys pull out the giant birdcage and put the child inside who now sits with ... Keep guessing? You have the impression that even if they were taking him to sleep at Michael Jackson's ranch in Wonderland, he would still give the same blank expression, this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> <br /> The sequence of titles begins and being a film of the 1980s, a pop soundtrack presents a major role. Obviously, this could have been great and funky at that time, but now in 2004 it seems very outdated. Not only that, but it is completely filled with something bloody opening. In fact, that's the main problem (and boy, it's serious) with this movie: all the mood seems to change so much from one scene to another, that sometimes it's like watching scenes of totally different movies together. I personally blame the director, but it should also be noted that both the scriptwriter and the producer should share the same guilt. Did anyone know before starting the shoot what kind of movie would it be? It's part fantasy, part martial arts, part movie friends, part comedy and everything is garbage.
