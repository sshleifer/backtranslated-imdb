I really paid to see this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> I would get a rating of 1, but the fight scenes between the robots are fine, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I do not have any problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies are probably the ones that suffer the most with a small budget for obvious reasons. But, one way this film fails is that almost all the pieces in each set looked cheesy and cheap. I mean, could not they even make it look "good"? <br /> <br /> The other main reason why this movie is horrible is acting. If I saw her now and knew what to expect, I could enjoy it. for the cheese factor, but at that moment I was expecting a good movie and I had no idea how horrible it would really be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience ended in only 85 minutes.
