I bought this movie blindly and I am quite upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say that it is at least worth the rent for some great deaths and a laughable performance. It's not a good movie by any means, but I must say it was quite entertaining. I guess you could call it so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting is horrible, I feel I could have done a better job showing, at least, any emotion. History is nothing new and has been made better. I guess I only have one weakness for any carnival-ski type movie. I would say rent it or download it, but definitely do not buy it. It is not worth more than a clock.
