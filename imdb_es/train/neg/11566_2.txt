Maybe I could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default value is OFF. When the final credits started rolling, I could not believe it was that. Like our poor, but beautiful protagonist, I felt used, dirty, cheap ... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn in broad strokes and the writer's disdain for the rich Thatcherites was evident. I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this image. Unfortunately, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from giving it a "1" was the beautiful landscape, human and vegetable.
