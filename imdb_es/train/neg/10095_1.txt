Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There is a great possibility that they need immediate professional help, since anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can not grant any star is literally scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I guess it's pretty much a kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie without porn or really horrible footage (apart from acting, the plot, the story, the scenarios, the dialogue and the sound). I mistakenly assumed that they were zombies. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's pretty frightening in justice; You are terrified that someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and they will leave thinking that you are a weirdo who sees homemade videos of amateur torture or something like that. <br /> <br /> I am so confused that I am writing this review on my mobile, so I do not forget to try to lower the rating beyond the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered <br /> < It's the worst movie I've seen and I can say (with my hand in my heart) that never, never will be overcome.
