I can not help but laugh at the people who praise this show as touching and moving. On the one hand, it is totally unrealistic for these people to have perfect lives after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to maintain these new mega-houses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes should surely increase after this happens. Also, the noise would bother me. <br /> <br /> Second, how excessive can a reality TV show become? It is practically the same repetitive garbage week after week. They introduce us to a family that suffers, that renovate the house, then surprise the family and they all break the boxes of Kleenex. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the renovation part is. The only interesting part of the program is to see what the house looks like, but even that segment is destroyed by false confessionals and constant sobs. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a program that pretends to be honest but falls flat. Skip this. If you like real television, "Survivor" is very superior and moving.
