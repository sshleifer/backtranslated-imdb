Each new autumn alignment show deserves, at least, my "3 strikes and you out" policy. I give the comedy 3 opportunities to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I actually told the television: "Canceled tomorrow." It was so bad Now I've seen the first 4 episodes of "The Cave Men" and I still have to manage even a smile. Not a joke, a laugh, a laugh, in fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself for watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this program. I'm just not "getting it", but I think that a comedy on one of the main television networks in prime time, HAS to be funny; But there's no laughing at me YET. There is simply no way for ABC to put the least fun comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. I KNOW that there has to be an internal joke that just does not match my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, "I understand" the social aspect of this, but WHERE ARE THE JOKES? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a moment of light bulb and hit me on the head screaming "Eureka".
