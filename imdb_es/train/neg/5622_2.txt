OK, apart from the psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. The music that I could have done without her (not that it was bad music, it just did not fit into this movie). <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director mentions the frequency. -lactando the pagan perspective on the existence of Christ and a surprising comparison of the events and events of the life of Christ against the lives of mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he mentions the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents a "good" case, but not one that amazed me. <br /> <br /> If the director had followed the facts and continued with them, this film would do it. They have been good However, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks against Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and a private Christian school that the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his former director (who, throughout the course, comes to light that the director established under false pretenses), I felt that the director acted like a child. I was asking good questions but, like the movie itself, the interview collapsed in an attack on the particular rules of this private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are only interested in information, look at the first 30 minutes or so and then turn it off.
