I saw this movie in a screening of Sneak Preview and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. He is full of jokes and does not take pride in the action sequences (like the shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of the things that I enjoyed in the movie ... and many of which I did not agree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. Poop's jokes. 4. The guy was a cunt. 5. Not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Once again taunting Bush ... WE GET IT THAT IT IS AN IDIOT ... move on. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. The murder of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. The majority of the cast was just outrage and out there. <br /> <br /> Now the (few) good <br /> <br /> 1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. A lot of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo from the manufacturer of Postal) 4. Uhm ... I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are some moments "what the ef" <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He made another fucking game in the adaptation of the movie. Congratulations to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
