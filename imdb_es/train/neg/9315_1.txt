This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was horrible! I can not emphasize it enough! The acting, the direction, the story, the characters and everything about that was bad! It was so corny and clich√©. Do not be fooled by the cover, or the label line "The 'Texas massacre' is nothing to laugh about." Are you frog 'kidding? It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until it reaches the main character Brendan, OK, now turn it off. What I got from the movie was: A group of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown who sings lullabies kills them in unoriginal and false ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would also be a waste of your money and time! I went through most of the movie because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and YET it was not worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie of all! Rating: does not deserve one.
