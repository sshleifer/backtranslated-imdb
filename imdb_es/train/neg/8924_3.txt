It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> While some of them are witty and modern, many of them are boring, without grace and without life. Many of the gags simply sit there, without spark or energy. <br /> <br /> From the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch have recovered. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (too bad he has not made more movies). But for my money, there's too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed is not given a chance to fight. His character seems relegated to moving aside, wondering what he is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The low rating of the users should give an idea of ​​the public opinion on this piece. The original Vidal provided a great potential that was wasted. Even the 'classic' movie clips did not do much. In general, it's a pretty bad effort, and it's not likely to improve much over time.
