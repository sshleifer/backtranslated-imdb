Yes, the character of Madsen, while talking to the woman from the television station, is correct: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie does not change anything about it. Okay, here are the good policemen, the moral policemen, even the blacks, the Christians, the martyrs. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And the most important thing for the fans of the action: the shooting is boring. It's just shoot and shoot and shoot. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then at least you'll have something to do. The only moral of this movie is: The LAPD is good now. There are no more bad cops in it. If you like commercials that are not critical and euphemistic for the police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've seen. (2 points per camera and edition).
