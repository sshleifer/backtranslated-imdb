Criminally Insane 2 is included in the new DVD of Satan Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and it's also a good thing, because when I watch a movie and I know there's a sequel (especially something that is as dark as this) I'm always curious. Now I have my curiosity satisfied and I will never see this again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks" of CI, and images of Ethel asleep, remembering good memories, I suppose. Thanks to Proposition 13, she left Napa State (does she wonder if she could see The Cramps play while she was there?) And they sent her to a house midway through the race run by a nice old lady whom Ethel quickly calls "grandma" " All this was filmed with a video camera, so the image and sound are quite pathetic, and even complete with a couple of "rolls". Of course, Ethel does her thing, which is to send anyone between her and the food, especially the guy who witnesses one of her acts of chaos and extorts her dessert. Also, you have to ask about any intermediate house for killers that has a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the sink. I guess it's all a matter of mistaken "trust". If you liked it or did not like it Criminally crazy, either way there is no good reason to see this, except out of curiosity. One wonders why the manufacturers of this even got annoyed. 2 out of 10
