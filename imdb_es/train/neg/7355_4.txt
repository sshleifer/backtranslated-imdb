Do not get me wrong, I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series, as well as the movies, but they are enough like: Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough! Mr. Suchet could have used that incredible talent in another of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the performance of all the actors was excellent. The sets were great and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how "horrible" he looked. I hope it does not look that way in 'real' life! Honestly, I can not remember other movies if the ending was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought it was a pretty bright touch if Mrs. Christie wrote it that way or not. I'd rather have that end before I'm wasted in jail!
