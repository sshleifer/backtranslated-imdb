Where to start ... Oh yes, Message for the bad guys: the first time you find the person who has been tracking (to kill) who witnessed a crime you committed, do not waste time talking to her to do so. Another chance to escape. Message to the victim: when the bullies talk to each other and argue, take the opportunity to "RUN", do not sit and watch until you make a noise they hear. Message to the Director: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute advantage in a vehicle or on foot, you can not have the bad guys on their heels or bumpers immediately! Time and movement do not work that way. It would also be good to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men in order to leave an abusive relationship at home.
