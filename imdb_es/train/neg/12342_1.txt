Anyone who is familiar with my comments on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a cranky bastard from time to time. There are many movies that I do not like, and for some unfathomable reason, I feel the need to review them. However, if someone out there is curious to know the name of the worst movie I've seen, look no further in Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this bears the title of the no of all times. 1 horrible movie. I can not believe that I really did it from the beginning of this mess until the end! <br /> <br /> It's clearly meant to capture the flavor of Young Frankenstein by Mel Brooks, but where the movie was a funny shot In the horror movie traditions, this is a desperately tense and misdirected attempt to hide the laughter of a shamefully weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. feel ashamed to be here like a couple of journalists in modern Transylvania (maybe they realized from the beginning that they were condemned to this situation). During their investigation, they face all the major monsters of past horror favorites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who manages to challenge this film to the end can pray for a stake to be led through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom. It marks a nadir of the race for all involved and shows that when the comedy fails greatly, it results in terribly terrible entertainment.
