Back in my days as a usher "Private lessons" played on the 4-plex I was working on. It was a nightly success that sold out on Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I could never see it, but I saw it was on the wire last weekend, so I decided to give it a try. What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've seen and one that made me feel very uncomfortable watching it. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that a teenager wants the desire of his sexy maid (Sylvia Kristel). She also seems to feel attracted to the child, but for more sinister reasons. So we have scenes of the child watching him undress and she invites him to look. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a teenager, has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen in my life. Their "frightened" reactions to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches it is horrible. I did not laugh even once during this piece of scrap metal. <br /> <br /> And let's not start with the secondary plot of the maid and the driver who plan to extort money from the child. Let's say it's about faking a death, burying a body ... I could go on and on, but it gets more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes are the worst I've seen. Although Eric Brown was older than he seemed, the fact is that he looks like a baby. It seems he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if THAT was acting, then maybe I should rethink my criticism of Brown) and went too close to the limits of child pornography to be erotic. I have never been so disappointed in a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is very beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I must mention the previous scene. For me it is simply sick, but I remember that the audience cheered while the film froze and dissolved into credits. Our hero returns to school and starts flirting with one of the teachers. He invites her out to dinner and she looks at him as if Tom Cruise had invited her out. She nods affirmatively and he walks away, smiling at the triumphant camera. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes, I am sure that teachers everywhere would only risk everything for a simple looking adolescent boy. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal this movie had in 1982. Certainly, it was more than nakedness because there were so many. Sexual comedies for nude teenagers who bombed at the box office. And to think that these same teenagers who applauded that film 22 years ago are now going up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country. That is a scary thought.
