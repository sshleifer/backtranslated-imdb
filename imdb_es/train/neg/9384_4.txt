Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit in the same year, THE PUBLIC ENEMY. She will not be remembered for this strange story about a girl from Hood who discovers that her past will always be with her. <br /> <br /> In a way, this seems a bit old for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the famous inert LIGHTS OF NEW YORK of 1928.
