There is not a single sympathetic character in this whole movie. Is the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh the one we are supposed to be looking for? Well, let's see, we realize that he is a defense lawyer for the shit that brings criminals out of technicalities. Treat your coworkers as if they were cattle, involve them in their own personal crisis (in the process, killing one of them), endanger the safety of their children, threaten their ex-new boyfriend's boyfriend, try to force the police and school administrators - and all this why? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD! I was really trying to get the father and his gang to beat the lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... it would have made a much more satisfying ending.
