It is not the best of the movies that can be seen today. I read a lot of comments about Shining and I expected it to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and the atmosphere were good, but there was no history here. There was not a single moment of fear. I was waiting for a suspense movie, but there was no horror or suspense. The only scene that scared me was during the chapter change scene that shows "Wednesday." There are many fragments in the movie. Most things are left without explanation, with nothing to link it with anything. History does not tell us about women or other scenes that are shown. It can be a good movie to watch in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
