This is one of the most hateful and cruel films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was tricked into staying with me, as the presence of Donald Sutherland gave him some credibility. [That's the last time it will happen.] <br /> <br /> The character of Lesley Ann Warren was annoying and as stupid as they come. There were more intelligent characters than hers who were killed in the movie. That is one of the many things in this movie that made me ask: "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the nighttime cable so full of sadistic garbage full of pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on being terrorized and killed. This film could have been as suspense as without being sick and twisted in the process. All it ends up doing is turning the stomach of the spectator with his illness and insulting the intelligence of the spectator. <br /> <br /> The cast is deceptively good. My guess is that they first loved Sutherland and used it to attract others as if they were lemmings. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage a chance.
