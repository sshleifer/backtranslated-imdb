The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the parricide of CÃ©sar is the conjuncture. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to review this film in depth because, as I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult and I discovered that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela simply plays well. He has a strong will, but he is also a very tender and supportive soul of the soul. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and his romance is the main thing of the first episode. So, it's not really a documentary, not a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After the parricide, a new lover (Marc-Antoine) arrives but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. Then, the second episode seemed boring to me and its tragic destiny does not count on much force. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; The live location of Morocco is exotic and the cabinets are splendid. The producers have a lot of money for sure, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, boats, Sphinx) that it's fun. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like very much to hear it in French or English to make a definitive opinion about these two films.
