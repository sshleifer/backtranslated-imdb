This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's tired and wasted acting style is completely inadequate for the audacious passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a boring and petulant teenager to whom his braces hurt. Nor can I believe that they have eliminated the scene of Edward's great marriage proposal from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I appreciate that they finally used a woman so young and simple to play Jane, a character that is supposed to be a mundane 18, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the personalities and passions of the novel, please see the Version of the 70 with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one has touched the Rochester character as Scott did.
