Working in a video store I can watch a lot of movies and sometimes I try to watch some of the not so great movies. Proud he became one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a manned ship mainly black during the Second World War had some merit. However, in less than 10 minutes of watching the film, you discover that the main point of the film was to talk about racial tension in World War II. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is marked at the point of excess throughout the film. I congratulate the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the difficulties they endured. A film should have been made focusing on the achievements that these men made for themselves, for the Navy and for their country, and not for making a film whose focus is racism during World War II.
