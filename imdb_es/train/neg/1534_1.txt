From the block of digitized images to the performance that makes Keanu "I'm so smart that it could be a bulletin board for me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner, this movie bites him (no pun intended) The best of this is the eRATicate box in the second segment (which of the three seems to be the strongest piece in terms of story and "turn"). I wish I had spent the Â£ 3.99 that cost me something else, like erm ... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you will really be disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you are looking for something amateur and with actors that are more of wood than a 2x4, then go ahead. However, if you want some quality werewolf action, look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The werewolf Hunt.
