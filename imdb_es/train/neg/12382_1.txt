Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would wallow in their graves if they knew that this Guess who comes to dinner. Rip Off was actually in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with the 1967 masterpiece by Director Stanley Kramer. Today's theft is a joke. So a white man from an overly stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island takes his African-American girlfriend home (inserts GASP here) to her grandfather's father's funeral. The reactions of their relatives were, of course ... predictable. This movie was so painfully telegraphed from the beginning to the end. My girlfriend really started making fake snores to tell me she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Take a pass on Wake.
