The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has been gilded before with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I entered the film (in an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the stain promotions. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before this, this movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which to begin with was already over, stretches and continues without development. or additional layers. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if you had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to reduce my losses). The performance of Akshay Kumar is average at best and John Abraham should not try to do comedy again. The comedy aspects of the film in general were quite week. I just remember laughing like the double of the whole movie. There is definitely no laughter on the side that consumed me in HERA PHERI or, to a lesser extent, in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but in general, because his role and character did not have much space to grow, he did not have much impact on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who only appears in the movie, was fun to watch while on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, it is better to pass this movie.
