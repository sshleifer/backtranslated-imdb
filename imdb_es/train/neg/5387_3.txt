In an instant, when it seemed like it was getting interesting, it never got there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, they really do not have any point (if there was one it was very boring). There was no action, suspense or horror, and the characters had no heart, so they did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it was not a choppy and shaky camera work and if there was music it did not bother me like in some really bad movies and the acting was not terrible. .
