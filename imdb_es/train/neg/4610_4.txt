I saw this movie because I noticed that I had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I've had a theory about her for a long time, she's a talented actress, but it seems she never shows it, because she's always in this kind of low-budget movie. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act on the unfortunate material in which I always see her. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Wendt played against the guy, and that was so jarring that he received recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk noticeably since the last time I saw her. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. This is NOT a bad thing. She still looks very good. I would like to see her in a better movie.
