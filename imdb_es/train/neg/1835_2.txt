Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy". Every time the characters repeat what you've already seen, and it was not funny the first time, a movie is in serious trouble, which is certainly "Envy". A movie that is based on a joke should have a place to go. Here we have a movie that is not going anywhere. Christopher Walken would especially like to forget this bomb, because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller has been in some quite good black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex", come to my mind immediately. Make sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, only total nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low rating, because like its subject, it stinks. - MERK
