I do not think this is a bad show in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a program about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbid that anyone go to law school based on these programs, what I had heard was the case when I saw some program interviews. I just choked a bit. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not here. Their constant harassment of women in the program is fun at first. But since that's what they're doing literally all the time, I've realized that this is as deep as the program is going to get. Trying to interject some serious, dramatic and even heartbreaking moments in the midst of this mockery of a real show does not compensate for the progressive loss of interest I have experienced in trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's extravagant and free "public service announcements", in which he expresses his opinions, do not impress. Denny Crane is simply annoying. He was embarrassed by him and the writers of the program for Crane's speech in a colonial suit. <br /> <br /> I'm giving two stars because there are times when I thought that the program's attempts to address some contemporary problems were done with care. <br /> <br /> I think the writers of the program realized that the sexual harassment shown by Denny and Alan was becoming dominant even for those who invited them the most from the start. The problem is that I do not care if the sexual harassment treatment in the program is done well, but I felt that the writer was insulting me with the artificial installation of sexual jokes throughout the program with the hope that my libido would help me continue . back for more. I am no longer a teenager, and I believe that this program is promising if its objective was not to attend to the lowest common denominator to obtain qualifications. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am writing this after I realized that it really is not going to be much better than this. It's a shame because it's one of those programs that I'd love to love.
