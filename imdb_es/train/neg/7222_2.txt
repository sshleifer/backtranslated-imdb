Knowing the Enki Bilal comics for quite some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought that this would be a good way for the artist like Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but, the film leaves a lot to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this movie has the impression that it could do better. I will not suggest if you should watch this movie or not. Most likely, if you are reading these pages, you have already seen or seen it, but be prepared for the 102 bad minutes.
