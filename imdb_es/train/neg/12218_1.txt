Very bad. Very very bad. As a partner who aspires to do, be in, or at least smell the catering table on a film set, I find it difficult to criticize the independents who actually got a movie of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> Realizing that Frightworld aspires to nothing more than raw exploitation (something honorable in itself) and trying to make it conform to the most common standards is an Error. And to be fair, it's more entertaining than, say, the Red Zone of Cuba ... but not by much. So I will not try to criticize, just let me make some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point of the movie, should not I be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three experts, make sure that at least one knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your main maniac must be more afraid than a Smurf doll. . Difficult, I know, but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of whom you can hire are really cheap. Get one that knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) The fact that there is someone who knows how to use After Effects and other great programs does not mean that they should do it every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) Congratulations for having the girls take off their top, but next time, take off the clothes that we want them to be removed. <br /> <br /> 7) The edition should help tell the story or establish a state of mind. At least in this type of movie editing you must sell gore gags. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in the stomach of a character is not scary, it is careless. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once he started counterattacking. There were some sharp images, unfortunately, they were thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like the Frightworld moxie. Next time, now that you have a kind of movie under your belt, I hope everyone involves aspiring to something better than Colman Francis. Improve at least Ed Wood.
