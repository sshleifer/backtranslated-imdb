Poor performance, no script, no plot, no killer convincing, no suspense, no original settings, use the same closet / under the bed / person behind you in the mirror again and again, it makes it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a way of presage either, and the fact that NO ONE ever "really" dies (at least not on the screen), which in turn eliminates any suspense that can be invoked immediately and makes everyone feel more deceived. spend money on your admission ticket ... it's a horror movie without any type of LMAO. The MOST you see is what seems to be that someone took a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it on a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teenager who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring you to have enjoyed this, or you were drugged / drunk at that time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and I do not bother writing reviews so often unless I really hate something or really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> But this movie is INCREDIBLE and I think I have a duty to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this type of movie ever again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to rent a "bad" movie in the Weinsteins box office success, and another when you have to sit in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in the case you want a bit of nostalgia remake, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a reimagination. It's not scary or attractive, nor is it satisfying enough to be "fun" as others have claimed in IMDb ... it's simply obsolete and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what this movie will take away from you: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having a sexual relationship with JS Cardone "The Forsaken" got another role as killer (because he's as scary as my poodle, and too cute to kill anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who returns to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT care at the prom when they decide to announce candidates for the prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just does not show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste your money like I did. The "original" stinks too, but it's more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, although it's not as bad as this piece of shit (I regret it sounds vulgar or rude, but once you see it, you'll understand why I say what do I say)
