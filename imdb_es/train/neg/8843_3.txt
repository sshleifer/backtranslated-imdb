This movie is very creepy indeed. Unfortunately, not for the reasons that the filmmakers expected. <br /> <br /> There is also a serial killer of an intellectual author, but he is not what is creepy either. He's just your standard comic book villain, a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, although he has nothing particularly new to add. Incidentally, even for the vilest and reprehensible criminals, can they be detained chained in a position of stress, standing, with arms outstretched 24 hours a day, week after week? I suppose that in the world that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay gave us, everything is possible. <br /> <br /> No, what's really creepy about this movie is the central character, Danny. This unpleasant young man, aided and abetted, is true for some ridiculously lax security arrangements and a doctor totally carefree of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, which goes into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenseless young man. woman, and on the basis of nothing at all (her chronic dream prevents her from giving anything like informed consent) she imagines herself to have some kind of special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Apparently in a matter of days, he has arrogated to himself the right to kidnap her, believing (completely falsely, as we discovered) that he is capable of taking better care of her than anyone else, and within a few minutes of returning to his apartment, he is sexually abusing her, though again due to his drowsiness) totally unable to consent or resist. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions as to why you would feel this connection are confirmed soon. Of course, she is more or less incapable of developing mature adult friendships, not to mention sexual relations, so she resorts instead to this essentially infantilized woman, who due to her permanent dream has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of Only a few years The scene in which she discovers ice cream is particularly delicate, and the timidly wise look she gives him when he tells her sadly that he will have to wipe it again causes a particular shudder of horror. But, once again, I am afraid that it is not the shudder of horror that the filmmakers expected, but a spasm of revulsion that is much more direct. We can all see clearly what is at the end of our bifurcations here: it is the perfect dream of the innocent, sexual complacency and absolute dependence. Horrible, horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> What else do we have in this mish mash? The twisted landscapes are not as good as those of El Toro. The mandatory argument "You have to go to the police", where the main character always has a reason not to do it, even if it is the only sensible course of action. The sequence of automata, much praised in the comments here, though completely and meaningless ("It does not fulfill any function!", As Sigourney Weaver protested memorably in Galaxy Quest) and looked at me like the abominable Phibes doctor repeated in one of the Saw derivatives. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs does the best he can, so he's a star for that, and a couple more because you have to maintain a lower rating for movies that are even worse than this, and overall this It's okay ... Shot and performed competently.
