This movie was in a 50-pack of science fiction that a friend of mine got me for Christmas. It's very similar to the first Gozilla movie, and like that movie, it has scenes with American actors inserted without any real reason. An interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there is a tension of the Cold War represented between the United States and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampaging around the world, paying close attention to Tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites her. All in all, this is a good movie. Some of the scenes that involve Gamera, particularly the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at that time. If you like Japanese giant monsters movies, you will love this one. I give it a 4 out of 10. If this had been the unedited Japanese version that I saw, I would probably have got a 5.
