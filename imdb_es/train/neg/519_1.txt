At least with the teen geek gets the girl movies, the guy is generally unpopular with the girls. In the 40-year-old Virgin, she is replaced by a 40-year-old boy who is popular with women but has somehow remained a virgin. But then, are not you supposed to involve your brain with this movie or did I miss the part of being in a coma for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films in which 40 and so many years act as teenagers and women for some reason, this quality is attractive enough that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent television comedies seems to think that it has to rely on crude and shallow characters to laugh. They have made filthy movies. They have done the "let's act" as all Americans have a mental age of 15 years. Where will they go now? <br /> <br /> This movie is crude and crude entertainment, with nothing to recommend it.
