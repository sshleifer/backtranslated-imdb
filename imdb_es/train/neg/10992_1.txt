The Underground Comedy Movie, is possibly the worst train accident I've seen. Luckily I did not pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to see it again saying it was so horrible but I needed to prove to myself how horrible it was. I love colorful comedy. I thought that at least I would have that and I would entertain myself. No, on the other hand, the performance was so horrible, the "jokes" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was nowhere to be found. Maybe there was not supposed to be a plot, so I can not keep it against this movie. It's rather sad that the funny thing about a comedy is that an old woman hits her head with a bat ... Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform holding a bat. Hilarious Simply genius. It gave me the sensation to see this film that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe this was full of internal jokes that we just did not understand. Or maybe it is the worst piece of garbage ever made and should be enclosed in a vault and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
