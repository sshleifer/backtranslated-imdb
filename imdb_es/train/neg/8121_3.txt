The time is gold. This movie is not. I must learn to ignore critics who talk about small movies like Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was full and everyone was left with the same reaction: is this the movie critics talk about? What a piece of crap! <br /> <br /> The hook of this movie is the upwardly mobile black daughter who seeks and finds her family of white trash. Get it? <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is approximately 2 steps above a 60 minute story. The characters are shallow and unintelligent. I felt insulted by the fact that these people could not understand what was obvious to the public; the audience murmured to the movie screen what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun washing clothes.
