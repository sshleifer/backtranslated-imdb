STUDIO 666 (also known as THE POSSESSED in the United Kingdom) is another one that looks like a direct DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Although many of the direct DVD movies are fast stimulated or involuntarily fun in the bad sense, STUDIO 666 is a regrettable failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this article, each comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. . Each of these people has hit the nail in the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (at the time of writing this article) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it does better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM, two extremely mediocre slasher movies that I would not want on my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie must have been made hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film only has a slight twist (and one that is poorly handled) to the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Soon after, his spirit returns to possess one of his surviving friends. The said friend possessed goes on a wave of murders. The rest of the plot really is too weird to summarize. You will only have to see it for yourself, as long as your interest has not diminished to the point of extinction, of course. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. His character was always interesting and seductive when he was on the screen. She helps raise the film above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the phrases he was given to say were misspelled to say it gently and thus prevent him from saving the film. <br /> <br /> The address was equally bad. The villains did not seem in the least threatening, each death was totally devoid of suspense or tension, the atmosphere was nonexistent and the camera work was incredibly basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the TV series, GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES wrote scripts in an intelligent way, credible representations and an excellent use of camera angles. Maybe if the producers had seen that television series up close, they would have chosen some more techniques that could have saved this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is completely inadequate for the tone of the movie. It's just rock music and neither are the best examples of this type. Do not make me start with that horrible song that plays at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, in particular the dialogue, are involuntarily funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the movie up (or should it be down) to the bad-is-good level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a mediocre slasher with very little importance. Aspects I recommend this only to those who are fans of movies directly on DVD and have the desire to see each of the slasher ever created.
