After the reasonable success of MASTI, which was a little better, Inder Kumar returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie SEE THERE IS NO TIME, DO NOT LISTEN <br /> <br /> The movie reminds you to HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a tedious exercise <br /> <br /> The movie has such absurd jokes that you do not feel like laugh like the head of Snehal Dabi get stuck in the back of the horse and all those typical comedies that we do not laugh at now, but that make fun <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a clich√© way and some scenes are funny, sadly, that those moments do not last the story never moves in this half, even the comedy becomes boring The turn is handled well and the second half becomes an action movie where the blind and the deaf go to rescue the heroines and we have all the scenes of perse OTT fight and struggle <br /> <br /> The direction of Inder Kumar is bad. The music is fine, a song stands out. I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek It is horrible in the comic scenes, his time is very bad and he is well in the serious scenes. For some reason he continues to make comedies and ruined his career. Fardeen Khan is a bit better but too rigid. Among the rest, Esha and Amrita are the heroines that Boman Irani bothers here. Snehal Dabbi is fine
