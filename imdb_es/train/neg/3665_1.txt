Apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while indulging himself alcoholically; As I said before, although I've always wanted to capture one of Paul Naschy's werewolf images, this atrocity served as an introduction and, as horrible as it may be, I still intend to look for other entries in the series, albeit in a way very gradual . <br /> <br /> Despite some high-profile disappointments such as THE HOWLING (1981) by Joe Dante, I love the images of werewolves in general, but, to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the "plot" of this movie and I just stared. on my TV screen telling their absurdities as if they were. There were too many to mention here, but I have to say that two that I found particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf person (ie, going from a furious beast from a gunshot to a stunned zombie state in the very next one the next , as if he were taking a casual walk around midnight in the country, and wearing a completely different wardrobe to boot ... and, yes, he knew in advance the reasons for this), as well as the "Phantom of the Opera". the character of Wolfstein! But what do I know? Maybe the full-length version of this difficult-to-use mess could have been a genuine horror classic!
