I am happy to read so many negative comments about Tritter's argument. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like House's brusque nature and intelligence, but they really do not like the vengefulness of this continuous plot. It cuts with the real nature of the hospital's history and makes everyone angry with the police authority. It must have a more loving nature instead of revenge for everyone in the hospital. In addition, it seems that there are many questionable legal aspects of what Tritter is doing. Only he can not freeze the accounts and have the authority to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the vengeful she is showing is also hurting very sick patients in the hospital and it is not a good story to portray. I voted that the episode was horrible, not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece, it turns me off and the rest of the plot is affected by it, people say that they do not like to see the story lines anymore . Please change it. Get out Tritter.
