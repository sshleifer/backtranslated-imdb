It was thought that this was the flagship work of the open source community, something that would resist and shout to the world media to notice it, since we are not caught in the marketing trap with our options to produce a good job with tools open source. After downloading the basic version (die hard fan here on a dial-up modem) I finally got here and found my first problem. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp could not open it in my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open it on my Suse server. Mplayer managed to execute it perfectly. It will be difficult to spread it if normal users can not even open it ... <br /> <br /> The Film. Beautiful sound band, excellent lighting, master camera work and perfect textures. Everything seemed real. And then the two main characters moved ... and they talked ... And the movie died for me. Everything, apart from lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene), looked fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were so animated that sometimes I wondered if at this moment there are games in the market with cut scenes that entail less realism. <br /> <br /> Any frame of the movie is Fantastic ... as a frame, and the thing is great if none of the actors is moving. I am very happy that I have not recommended this to anyone. It would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Final Fantasy had a more ingenious and witty plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would get 10 stars if it were not for the Tragedy that is right there on the screen.
