I had high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought this would have a big impact. First, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. It looks as if his eyebrows have re-formed for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one might expect. Tim Roth is great as always here. Gama's thing really did not adhere to the original story line, I do not think so. I guess the best part of the movie was the ending. He had a great action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not so long, but sometimes it's a bit boring. I remember a while ago when Walmart had this really cheap movie for sale and I always wondered why. Now I know. I hoped to be dragged, but I was not.
