Christian Slater of 0 *, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the game's director, Uwe Boll tries to recreate the game in an action-packed bite and, unfortunately, does not succeed. Instead, it makes one of the worst MADE movies! Even though he gets a minor celebrity like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary foundations that a film should be good, like a story, and some basic relativity of what is happening in the dark and the light. The movie bounces and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And without mentioning the bad CGI used in making the monsters. Even though they looked good and the feeds were good, a bit lame. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating of 0/10.
