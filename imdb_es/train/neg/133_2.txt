Well, the reason to see it in the movies was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teenage movie. I mean, have not we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least they did not take them seriously! The plot sucks, and acting is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes with being the worst I've seen in the movies with this one). <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the story, and the girls are so similar, you do not even know who has been killed and who has not. (And you do not care.) The only one of them that I knew beforehand was Denise, and she was the least talented actress I've seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Stay as far as possible from this movie. (2/10)
