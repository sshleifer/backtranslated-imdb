This movie should never have been made. Honestly, I must admit that before seeing him I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, although she made many films in Holland, and the young woman who took the lead role is a television personality with a constant smile on her face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main role I saw recently in Bride Flight and although that movie is better, it did not convince me. To begin with the story, I have not read the novel on which it is based, but the script that underlies the film is something that could have been done considering that children celebrate a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, it was most of the time spoken aloud. Greetings to the cameraman, at least he tried to get something out of it. It is a pity that the film is poorly edited, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
