Seriously. This will not help the Australian film industry to make this type of film without values ​​of any kind. Okay, if you're a fool and you do not have anything better to do, then maybe. I think the filmmakers here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have, and this is not the vehicle for it. Come on, this movie is in bad taste.
