I thought this was a sequel of some kind, and it's bound to be the original of 1983. But a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it. <br /> <br /> Actually I had very little expectations of This movie, but I just lost 95 minutes of life. Without suspense: actually I feel clairvoyant, acting wrong and so full of technical errors, so, as a computer, I could not believe it. They have tried to turn it into a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead get the original. The issue is still valid. Do not leave too much power in a machine. And the acting and the plot is much more exciting and compelling.
