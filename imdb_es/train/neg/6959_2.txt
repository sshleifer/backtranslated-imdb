I went to see this a few days ago and it's hard to forget that movie ... for the wrong reasons. It is supposed that this movie is fun, it is not, not a single laugh in the theater (maybe for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu), and it is boring, boring, boring. Even sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were saying. They only speak fast and do not open enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I was surprised saying after a sentence that was supposed to be funny "what, what did he say", and I'm French. I hate to say that, given that I think that good movies are made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who will go to see the movie (if it is ever shown outside of France). <br /> <br /> We are deeply sorry for that cr @ p. 2/10
