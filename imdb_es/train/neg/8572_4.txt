The thin story refers to two brothers from small towns and their struggles for family honor. David Morse is the responsible policeman and the "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, the "bad boy", is a former soldier and ex-con. As an actor (particularly in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method. By becoming the first writer and director of this obtuse and artistic drama, he develops his script and his characters through the same methodical process, reducing the rhythm to the rhythm of the crawl (apparently so that we can capture every nuance and inflection). This approach could be fascinating if it were three-dimensional characters, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as brothers. Worse, we expect more from veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who barely have a chance to find something interesting. The image is balky with turgid sequences, a wobbly narrative and a confusing edition (always inclined to point out the artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but for the most part they are an irritation. * 1/2 of ****
