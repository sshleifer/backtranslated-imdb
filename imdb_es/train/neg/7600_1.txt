This movie shows that good acting comes from a good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but in this he is young. Donald Sutherland introduces himself as an amateur. Why? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is horrible and the actors seem bored and half open. The atmosphere of the movie is bad, I could only think when it would end and I turned it off in half. The director has done a very poor job and, although I have not read the novel, it is certainly a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film tries to evoke and the message and the plot never reach the audience. In a word, it is a TERRIBLE movie.
