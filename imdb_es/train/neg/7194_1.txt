According to the well-known Disney theft practice ... I mean ... buying known properties and ruining them, this real-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has to be one of the worst repairs in a year of bad news. re-do I grew up in the original cartoon television series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this whole movie. Penny's great computer book is not present. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructive orders that always end up detonating in the Boss. The new ones are a gadget convertible that speaks softly (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical unreal Hollywood romance. Do not fill the chests to pay Disney executives and even your _ex_executives - do not watch this movie. <br /> <br />
