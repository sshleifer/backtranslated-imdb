I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie at Best Buy about a year ago and I said to myself: "It seems funny, plus you have Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I proceeded to pay $ 15.99 plus taxes for it. I took him to a house of friends and we were both horrified by how badly it was written and acted. The performances in wood abound. All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive. After 90 minutes I ducked my head in shame, knowing that I could never recover those 90 minutes or $ 15.99. Literally almost I also cried, because if that was what could be considered "comedy", I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours about the horror of this movie to the point that I needed to see it only to understand how bad it was. During the Christmas season of this year I saw him with him because he did not want to see him alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because while I was watching it I got angry. I started shouting at the movie, and I'm not someone to talk about movies. Everyone I know who has glimpsed this movie has accepted that it is the worst they have ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not even save this movie. The fact that this movie is not on the list of the last 100 in IMDb is amazing. The fact that his grade (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
