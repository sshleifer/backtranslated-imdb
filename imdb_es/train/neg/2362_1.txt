The first of the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror films of all time. This is the crappiest When I sat down to see this, I was really thinking that, how bad were the fourths and fifths, it would have to be good after the terrible ones before. Boy was wrong Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes, I really felt tempted to turn it off, but I thought not, maybe it will get better. It was not so. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a dismal movie by itself, but it did not need another sequel, because the last two (the fourth and the fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back? The performance in it was TERRIBLE, the story line was predictable and trash and also had flaws in it. The way they did Springwood was totally wrong. It does not respect the first one at all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Some people are saying that this movie was "fun". This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be "funny"? I would call it curiously shit. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not that information have emerged as in the first? The ending was also simply stupid and corny, exactly like the rest. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. It simply shows itself. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Wes Craven has created something so good at first, but he has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs to the bin. They should not even have bothered to make this movie. Neither any of the other sequels, except the third. The third is the only decent of all the sequels. <br /> <br /> If this were a DVD by itself and it would not be part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have spoiled it when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel. <br /> <br /> - A complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So, please, do not waste your time on this worthless garbage.
