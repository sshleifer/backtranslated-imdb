Basically, there is a family where a young child (Jake) believes there is a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a telenovela ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> Well, first, when you are going to make a movie, you must decide if it is a thriller or a drama. As a drama the movie can be seen. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that completely ruins the whole movie! I was hoping to see a movie similar to BOOGEYMAN, and instead I saw a drama with some meaningless thrillers. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 only for dialogues of parents and descendants who play well. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.
