Oh the hilarity! Oh the joy! Another movie that is so bad that it's good! Or so I thought. In fact, this loses the "so bad is good" phase and goes, unfortunately, directly to "could have been so bad that it's good, but they ruined it and made it just bad". <br /> <br /> To begin with, it's too long. It cuts half an hour and could have been more bearable. Then put on such absurd plots as "the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food stored and will be rich if the mission fails". Duh! Or the "talking pump" frame device last seen in Dark Star. Guess what ... as in Dark Star, the pump has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add a script of "we can not act to get out of a kindergarten play" and will have the solar crisis in a few words. <br /> <br /> Light relief should be obtained in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we call it in this film), whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a child through the desert and telephone to the child's father to pick him up ... eventually. Between driving and telephoning, Jack dispenses nonsense and reading and cackles a lot, but contributes little to the story, just as it is. In short, it's the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> My award for "The most ironic straight line delivered" is for Charlton Heston, who, when he meets his oldest son for the first time in a long time. , says that his son looks a bit "out of shape" while he himself is standing there with his guts bulging over his waist and in dire need of a Captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> The bad boy is also fun. The best confidence man, who has a bright white hairstyle that made me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarities, there is little to recommend this movie. The ending is a copied sequence (but fortunately shorter than) the final sequence of 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy more of this movie, if you are foolish enough to see it, as I did: <br / > <br /> 1. Every time the pump talks, imagine it's called Tarquin (Trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. As long as Chuck Heston is on the screen and ready to speak, he goes forward reciting a line from the Planet of the Apes, like "Take off my dirty legs!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the protagonist is stressed (it is most of the time) she is still hoping against the hope that she has an aneurysm and dies soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless scenes of "the ship has broken again", keep waiting for the technicians / technicians to design a Scotsman like "You can not change the laws of physics!" or something like that. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, do whatever it takes to help you overcome this. I fell asleep halfway and woke up to realize that I had not lost anything, or that the plot (although you can laugh) has advanced. So do not worry about unplugging, you will not miss anything.
