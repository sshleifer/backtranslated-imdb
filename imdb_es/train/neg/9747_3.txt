Ok, first of all, this movie is crap. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, then transporting and reassembling it is at least intriguing. But that is all that leads to this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this type of machine, they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Live with the responsibility of this type of power and deal with constant temptation, that is, with the invisible man. But do not ... break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. Then the doctor comes back together and tries to transport himself. Just to be tricked by your beautiful but silly secretary, (duh). What would not happen if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he is roaming the countryside killing people because his little experiment failed and they did not give him money. Wah Then, to make the film worse, introduce a British relationship between the two semi-competent teachers hired to help him. Between their love sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills half of London. All this could have been avoided by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried, so I give it an honest 2 stars for the effort, but it would have been better if they had not broken the damn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try again. Damn you, Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
