Jerry spies on Tom to listen to a spooky story on the radio and take the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I did not find this particular episode so funny: the humor seemed quite limited and the whole setup was a bit lame (Jerry is essentially the "bad boy" in this, tormenting poor Tom for no reason in particular). <br /> <br /> There is an occasional flash of inspiration (like Tom's literal "heart on the mouth" experience, and the moment when his nine-year-olds are taken from his body), but, in general, this effort lacks the frantic pace, the excellent animation and the ingenuity of most other T & J cartoons.
