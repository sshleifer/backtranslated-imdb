It is rare that I find a film so horrible, so annoying and so irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it is not a blur of confusion and meaningless about the striking edition, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a bad bitch? Because her golden fish died as a child and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally atrophied and hating everyone. When the dialogue is not cliche or banal, it is riddled with lines of laughter like: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At one point, the bounty hunters have a guy tied to the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Due to a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling up his sleeves and reading the number, his arm is removed with a shotgun. At another time, do the bounty hunters carry a bomb to a meeting arranged with the Mafia and threaten to shoot the bomb unless the Mafia let them go? Clearly, not having gone to the meeting would have been too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is not convincing and is terribly misinformed. Mickey Rourke manages to save some credibility from this disaster. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, with True Romance being one of them, but all I could think of while I suffered this nonsense was that it must have been done by a complete idiot.
