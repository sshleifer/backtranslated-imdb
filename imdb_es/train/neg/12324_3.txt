This was a scam of the same trash we had to see host Bob Saget for the half hour before this. Dave Coulier just thought it was fun and it was almost the same program as the funniest Home Videos in the United States, except for the hosts who have a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must have really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycling bin for his jokes. It was torture enough to have to see him imitate Popeye and other washed cartoons begin in Full House. That guy who played all the practical jokes about everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie. Coulier must have needed money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
