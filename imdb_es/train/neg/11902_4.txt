The hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, he has difficulty finding a distributor in the United States because most of those who saw it could not reconcile the apparently conflicting messages of Christianity and American anguish. The idea that someone sees this as a religious film anyway is laughable. <br /> <br /> Why does a minister on a mission pray with the homeless or do you want someone "Godspeed" to turn it into a "Christian" movie? One could interpret that one is actually making fun of religion in the "Land of plenty" with all its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is to deliver a bowl of soup and a biblical verse. A lot of unfortunate or oppressed perhaps? A lot of useless homeless missions? How about a bunch of veteran psychopaths from Vietnam? As delirious survivors of the "pink" agent, are we going to think that the United States is a "Land of plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Certainly, we do not have many people concerned about Palestinian politics based on the telephone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you work in a shelter for homeless Germans, the unfortunate would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than for their own personal survival, since the world knows how Europe is the "Continent of abundance" when it comes to of sophistication. <Br /> <br /> In fact, I agreed with the title at the end, since the United States is the "Land of plenty" and, in this particular case, it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, performances of Amateurs and films directed dispassionately. Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have "enough" time to lose seeing this piece.
