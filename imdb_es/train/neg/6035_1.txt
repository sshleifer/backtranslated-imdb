I really wish I could give a negative feedback to this, because I think I just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever filmed. the acting was just horrible, I mean REALLY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written by ... I can not think of anything horrible enough to say it. And the "outside" day and "inside" night takes you to think that the events lasted several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc., all the way to the Gofer, how to have lunch for everyone. Stay away from this at all costs. If my only salvation to stay out of hell is doing a good deed, it is telling the world not to see this shit. This movie is the exact reason why horror films are never taken seriously.
