Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail boy for UBC television station (which is United Broadcasting Corporation); He does not go anywhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like "Doctor's Dog by Abraham Lincoln" to studio executives, because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programming Director Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to choose a successful television show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who serves a double role as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimp that bothers Russell when he wants to watch television. It turns out that the monkey looks at all the popular shows and can easily choose the successes. Russell discovers the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to advance his own career. Understandably, things get GOOD for Russell and the cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles the chimpanzee (managed by Frank Lamping) has a good performance; Raffles looks bored and / or distracted during some scenes, when the chimpanzee is supposed to be interested; These could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. There is a slight satirical touch present: imagine a monkey choosing successful television programs! And, it's a monkey that gets a BEER during commercials (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal a lot of fun TV actors to recognize and try to locate. You could make a game to drink, in honor of Raffles beer drinkers, by guessing the actors and where you've seen them before. Here is a beginning. Hey, is not that "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> **** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
