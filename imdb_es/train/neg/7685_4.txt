Confusing melodrama taken from a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark leads the elegant luxury rural asylum, where his estranged wife struggles with queen bee Lillian Gish, who is self-appointed, and Widmark himself gets nervous for the new arrival of staff Lauren Bacall, who is recovering after the death of her husband and her son. Fascinating and confusing, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a love story of "David and Lisa" hidden in the lush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this script does not give them anything to build on. Precisely for one hour, most of the dialogue is about what to do with the curtains hanging from the library (this thread is not used as symbolism, it is rather a false clue in a non-mystery!). The image hopes to show the foolish people that disparate people come when they work in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is correct, but unfortunately, the indirect way in which Minnelli discovers this stew is not informative, enlightening or entertaining. ** since ****
