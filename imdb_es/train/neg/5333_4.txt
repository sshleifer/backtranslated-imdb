An overwhelming slapstick bug posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian champion who rides the bull and leaves the rodeo to stay at home in the desert of his family in Arizona, where the demands of the government have just invested in the herd of family cattle (which is in dire need of a stallion). What director Peter Tewksbury needs is a narrative skill, though what he lacks in the evaluation makes up for in sloppy comedy mounts (his social commentary is not exactly timely, but Tewksbury has a satirical curve to his extravagance and there are some scenes fun) Despite the colorful twists of support from Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general discontent gets out of hand, and there are too many problems and shouts to keep a lot of interest. As for Elvis, he is relaxed and playful, and although it is nice to see him having fun on the screen, one has to wonder if at this moment he had given up on the movies. This confusion of an image has a clear sense of what the hell, and although the spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. * 1/2 of ****
