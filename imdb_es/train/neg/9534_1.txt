I'm a fan of the best Best of the Best movies. But this one was horrible. No wonder it cost me so much to find him. I tried 4 video rental stores, until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the characters and the original kickboxing theme that this movie had with the first movie. 2 movies <br /> <br /> John
