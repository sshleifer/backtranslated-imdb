"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon, and a year later he left the jungle ... naked, it took him 45 years to return." Supposedly, "Keep the river to your right" is "a modern cannibal tale." In fact, anyone looking for an idea of ​​cannibalism will feel sadly disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a New Ginuea travel record, mostly promoting native art. The second half is based on photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but in reality that's all. Unless, of course, you are interested in the home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum presenting his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal tale". - MERK
