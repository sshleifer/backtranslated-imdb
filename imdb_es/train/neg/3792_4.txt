I have seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Now maybe I saw this movie from the stained point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in the specific business of ballet choreography consider this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found that everything from design to choreography lacks brightness and is not appropriate for a " cinematographic film ". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes resembled what they were supposed to be (that is, the candies did not look like candy, the rats did not look like rats, but chocolate kiss), the performance was weak, perhaps attenuated too much for the screen, and the choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the whole show very satisfying (at best), as if it were destined not to differentiate itself from any other production. But remember, once again, this is from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a heterosexual male theater director.
