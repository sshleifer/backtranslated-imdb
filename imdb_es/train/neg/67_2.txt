From the beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy that the result is totally predictable. Any good textbook about film script writing will advise the superposition of characters, the addition of character arcs and the structure of three acts. In this movie you will not find any of that. The cops are the bad guys, and as a result they are superficial, incompetent and cowardly. It seems that the creators of this film never think that the police could be an honorable citizen who believes that joining the police is a good way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer has no chance to regain his mind over whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The movie begins with his arrest for stealing a horse, but we have no clue about his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the door of a prison, but we only know that he has been inside for three years when we heard this much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many photos of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. The film seemed like a real task to watch. It is the direction of modern movies, and this discouraged me more seeing.
