(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can not be taken seriously. In some places it is so stupid that I can not help but laugh at everything. Try me to see the sequence in which Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with the whole climbing team or (and this is really my favorite) kills a bad guy by hitting a stalactite. Yes, what unholy force did he gather to accomplish such feats? I do not know, but it sure gives reality a race for money.
