This movie is supposed to take place in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove Park shown? P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L? The provincial parks are in Canada, and not in the United States. The inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with the pencil to "read" that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the film without any introduction and never shows up. We learn in the middle of the movie that this woman works in the district attorney's office. Then, in the correctional center, a guard PRECEDES Jenks through a door and turns his back on the offender! This will NEVER happen in a real correctional environment. The director really got into this, this does not happen in real life. The action is adequate. The plot is good. The cinematography is good. However, the many errors found in continuity lead to a vote of 3 out of 10.
