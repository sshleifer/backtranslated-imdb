Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg", will take control, along with Wes Craven, for another old "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which had an incredible story and a dog with a flashback, will be erased forever with this more technically polished remake (name only). A group of members of the National Guard (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills full of mutants. One by one the soldiers of the weekend are picked up. That's. There is some extreme violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is little else to be excited about. The "heroes" of the film are the usual group of cliches and mutants, very far from the original "family" of Craven, mostly resemble Brian Thompson of "Cobra" along with some creatures that Stan Winston had stopped filming in "Wrong Turn". Much of the action takes place in caves, wing "The Descent", and is well filmed by Sam McCurdy. A ridiculous aspect is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven to a cute mutant who hides around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original "Chainsaw". Weisz will be blamed for this boring debacle, but he is not really guilty because he does everything possible to maintain suspense and squeeze a bit of freshness from the situations conceived. He is not a fan, unfortunately.
