A flat and ordinary thriller about a deceitful woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the lover Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old friend from Andy's school, called Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as the resident surgeon, the problems are not far behind. <br /> <br /> The script fails because it does not carefully develop the promising premise in an effective and tempting thriller, and the lack of motivation, background and character development make the whole show come. None of the cast can generate interest in its shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is trying to resurrect an incredibly dead project, and is unable to entertain any of that. By the time the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, it will not matter. <br /> <br /> At least the cinematography makes Massachusetts look good. They also star George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
