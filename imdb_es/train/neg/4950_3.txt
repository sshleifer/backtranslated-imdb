I think that can sum up this show as well as anything else. Batman TAS may be the worst thing that has happened to cartoons based on comics because everything that comes after will be compared to that and nothing has been measured yet. It is too good. Was Batman Beyond good? "Yes, but it was not TAS". Is the Justice League good? "It's not that bad, but it's not a TAS." <br /> <br /> The Batman is certainly not a TAS, either, but I will not hold it against it. It would be unfair and, in addition, he has many other problems with him. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger and less experienced Batman combat crime is excellent, and sometimes art is very good. But for the rest of the time, art has no value in the United States, and this reveals many of the flaws of the show itself. It is programmed, written and designed as an American time. If I wanted to see the adventures of Jackie Chan, I would see the adventures of Jackie Chan. Or I could just bang my head against a wall at any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal and mentally unstable clown with a suit that uses his wit, unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When forced to fight hand to hand, he will resort to something cheap or he will be totally overcome. It is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks that knows kung fu and can jump in the air twenty meters, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain, there would be other less important characters who could have used or * pant * could have created a completely new one. And it's not that re-imaginations are a bad thing, do not get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from his villain B with an ice grip and turned him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course, Freeze was not exactly a classic villain at that time and made an improvement, but the point is valid. What The Batman does is that it takes everything you like from comics and the Batman tradition and gives it a great smelly tug. Guess what? They were eating corn. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that this show can not be against TAS, but it can be against their own legs and it still does not work for me. The plots are not good and do not develop better. They have been written for the demography of children under the age of twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This should not be a show for adults with insults, nudity and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a really good show is that it can be enjoyed at different levels by all ages. This program does not have that brand. <br /> <br /> Is this program a TAS? Of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
