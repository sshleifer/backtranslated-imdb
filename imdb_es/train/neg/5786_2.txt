When you look at this now and you listen to all the language here, it is surprising that it has been described as "PG", but that is the classification system of the 70s for you. Peter Falk launches the name of the Lord in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! However, few people consider it offensive and certainly not the hairs that make movies or the people who "qualify" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is a hint of how profane this film can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors you would not find in "The Sound Of Music" " <br /> <br /> I like the movies of theft and many films of directors William Friedkin, but this script is not delivered and has too much of the feeling of "Sleazy '70", visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in "Columbo" on TV, it must be a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in the movies. This is far from the only case.
