I lost my time and I gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If they gave a prize to programs that stink of THIS, they should sweep the category. The performance is poor and the story line is devised. Now the dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and finally it was scraped. This new program, based on the advertisements of an insurance company, is not fun and really has nothing in its favor. Possibly the original announcements and the number of times that were repeated, and still repeated, is what is wrong with this program. He has just arrived on television and we are tired of seeing the "caveman" characters.
