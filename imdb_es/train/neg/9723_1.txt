Jeux d'enfants or how the film was translated erroneously into English Love me if You Dare is a movie made by stupid people and stupid people. I just do not know how I could expect something worth watching in a movie with such an argument: two stupid ignorant children make the bet that each of them will do something (no doubt extremely idiotic) to prove to each other (what?) That They are "cool guys." I know I exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the whole movie is about. They get older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of weird alienated bugs they continue to perform their follies, thinking that they are great people. <br /> <br /> One could expect such a Hollywood movie, but france? It is even more offensive to see the film of the country that created Amelie a couple of years ago, which, by the way, the film tries to look like but it's very far, far away from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
