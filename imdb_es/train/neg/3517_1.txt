I do not know who wrote the script of this movie, but from the first moment I got irritated. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals act like fools, even if they managed to get a large amount of money from a bank and get away with it? Why does not the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, take the money and go with the chick as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give 5 points to this film for a good action and a great landscape, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give 1 point to this movie ...
