This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. The actors are of low level and the story is very funny. I respect fantasy, but The Lord of the rings is fantasy ... Conan ... it's fantasy ... THIS IS JUST NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why did they include this splash language, make everything worst? The only good thing is the cinematography and the work of the cutter.
