It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of a plaster! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too bad to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was fine. Not bad. I felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this disaster. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as her always. Charming and sweet, but without any purpose. The "romance" with John was completely incredible.
