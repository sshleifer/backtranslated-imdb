Sly Stallone is not the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, throw those prizes now! The mullet Frank, with mullet hair, seems to think that in every part he plays, he asks him to play the wise American / Italian refugee of the "Godfather". Please, have someone make you an acting offer "he can refuse it!" This movie just sucks the place, even by the terrible overacting in this, Frank still steals the dishonest act. All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms, gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of style with silent movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, what there is, is, it makes no sense when a meteor lands and turns all women into nymphs crazed by sex, but since this is a film certified by 15, that means that they get naked and make moans like dogs in heat. What happens in the end, I'm not sure, since I was losing the will to live long before the film was over. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' to see a reasonable movie about a meteor about to hit the ground. <br /> <br /> NB Point of order: when one of the women wears strips down to her underwear, she has her panties / panties under her suspenders / suspender belt, the panties on the suspenders allow women to go to the bathroom with less hassle. A trivial point, perhaps, but it shows how silly this movie is when you can not even understand this!
