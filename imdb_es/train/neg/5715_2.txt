"Say yes" is one of those movies that you hope will improve, but never does. He is the kind of "psychopath without motives who decides to threaten an innocent partner", so loved by video filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clumsy and, in several places, poorly translated. The performance is uniformly poor, especially of the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice is making his character seem threatening, when all he really does is make it seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention, as it is an idiot beyond belief. The 'heroes' do not think it's too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The 'heroine' twice manages not to see the villain when he is not more than a foot away from her. The villain goes through a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood and a bleeding bandage on his head) showing the police a corpse burned in the passenger seat of the car he drives. The villain is beaten, beaten with a shovel and caught with a fork, but it seems he is never impeded by these injuries, quite serious. And I do not even mean that terrible 'turn' that ends. Sheesh <br /> <br /> The only positive point of this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really is not more than a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is presented as a poorly written attempt, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but fails at every step due to the lack of talent in all those involved.
