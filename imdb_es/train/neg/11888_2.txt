To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there must be some facts and realism 1. We are never told why these people believe this. 2. The location is the end of the year in Toronto, Canada. SO SOMEONE, SOMEBODY SOMEONE AT NIGHT AND WHY (based on the costumes), WHAT DOES IT MEAN AS SEPTEMBER? <br /> <br /> 3. The performance was in that neo-au-natural style, which needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The pieces of the individual story were all sad and without any purpose. I could go on, but I do not want this to be as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (of 4) 2 in IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you I am as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
