The premise of the film is creepy: a woman becomes pregnant when she is kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie starts, a horrible opening scene states that it is a science fiction TV type C movie. It's a great Star Trek and a bit of X files, but more than anything it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie comes into play, everything is predictable and clich√©d. It seemed more like a splitter of 2 in a bad science fiction television series. Without suspense and without emotions, but not for lack of trying. Only many predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
