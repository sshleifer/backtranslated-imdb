In general, I am more willing to be more open about the coms rom than many, but this simply was not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original, I have not seen it, and I doubt it will. It has a lot to do with a serpentine plot, the lack of chemistry between the drivers and a magnificent behavior / character of its supposed male protagonist (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon appears on the screen with clothes and hairstyle of 15 years and a decade younger than that. He is supposed to be a teacher, and of course it is well known that school districts around the world love to hire less mature people than the children they pretend to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts that an actor could have made it nice, but old characters like John Cusack or Adam Sandler could have given him a chance. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor actor, but seems to think that he is both. Not once in the whole course of the film do you create Fallon in his role, or do you think there is any way in which these two people should or would be together. Near the end of the movie, there is a scene in which Barrymore (who was cute as always but could not take it alone, it's hard to have a romance with a person) tells Fallon that it's over, that it's been too much and that It is moving. in. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or lamenting over Fallon, you're actively encouraging her; He finally does what he should have done months ago. But, of course, the mechanics of the plot will not allow that to be the end (an ending that could actually have made a statement of this mess), and instead, we can see the girl in the rational race throwing it all away to pursue it. This infantile idiot and encourage their illusions. Of course, his intention is to be sticky and satisfying, but in reality it made me feel more upset than anything else.
