If you are less than 6 or 7 years old, then you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the television when she looks at her. As an adult, I can not stand it !! I'm ready for the sequels ... when they have a decent story. But this is by no means standard. Please forgive me for what it is, after all, a movie for children, but when you have to go through it almost every day when your children love you so much, you will understand why. My daughter would watch this movie again and again the same day if we left her. <br /> <br /> I have given this movie 4 out of 10 simply because it keeps my daughter more entertained.
