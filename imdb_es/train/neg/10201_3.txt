This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who is to blame. The public has to wait for the whole movie so that the culprits are captured. The result is like all episodes of "Columbo" or "murder he wrote." The director himself refers to the story of hackney showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills in 90 minutes, but the director insists on using the 120 minutes to complete each clich√© of the book. Skip this, you're not missing anything.
