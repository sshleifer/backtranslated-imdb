My 7-year-old daughter loved it, since Disney executives figured it would. That is the problem with "Air Buddies". It's a movie strictly for children, full of carefully calculated tenderness, a couple of politically correct morals and enough humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old child, you've seen it all before, and You have done better before. Think of "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you will get the general idea. I am of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period. "Air Buddies", which is almost as original as recycled paper, does not meet that standard. It is not the worst video your child could see, but there are better megatons.
