It is written S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character showed her tits. That was pretty tight. Before and after that the movie almost blows. The acting is like the electronic list and it shows well in the movie. Not to mention that it is a budget so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder instead of a decent half movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were fun. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. Apart from that, if you see this movie in Blockbuster, do everyone a favor and hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks that this movie is good should be evaluated mentally.
