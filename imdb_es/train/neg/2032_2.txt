I gave these two stars the incredible clarity of DV shot, which lends itself to the cold and dark sterility of their character. That was being generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this, since it is neither poetic nor forceful. Neither dramatic, nor suspense. Neither controversial, nor ordinary. It's just an unfortunate piece of junk that no fan of attacks or horror can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this, whoever it is. . Please, stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
