From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It is so full of cliches that your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, just for the performance of William Benton. I can not believe that people have voted 6+ for this movie. It is so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief ...). People are not born wrong. They are not born either. They are born with a clean slate. It is society, parents and education that make them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere on the line, it's certainly not going to be the American criminal system that puts them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than to waste it on this garbage. <br /> <br />
