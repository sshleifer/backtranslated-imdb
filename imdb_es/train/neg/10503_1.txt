Yesterday I saw this movie. I rented the Blockbuster DVD. In fact, I know one of the actresses of the movie. I will not say who ...! (That is kept secret ...) But I must admit that it was not as good as I thought it would be ... Tom Savini? Of course, I'd like to see it, but it's a pity that I have not been in the movie for a long time. What the film lacks is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It may seem like a good movie, but it was not like that. It's not that entertaining ... <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad that my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster. I chose this ... and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! It's not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
