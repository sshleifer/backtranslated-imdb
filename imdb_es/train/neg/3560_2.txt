For me, this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about Franks' fanatasies when he's traveling with a ladder and when he's sitting at business meetings ... The problem is that when you've been watching this movie for an hour, you'll see The same fantasies / funny situations over and over and over again. It is predictable. It becomes more like a television story where you can go and return without missing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren like Frank, but that's not enough, even when it's a comedy, he has to have more. variations and some kind of message for your audience ... <br /> <br />
