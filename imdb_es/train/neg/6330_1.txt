If you enjoy the cast and the original SNL shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When this came out for the first time, my friends and I waited in the queue for more than an hour to enter a fully sold movie theater. Halfway through the movie, the theater was 3/4 empty. We refuse to leave thinking that it would improve. When the movie ended, we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all the theaters and then disappeared from sight. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this movie. The film was an inside joke about SNL episodes that came out just after the release and closing of the movie in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and mail to get a refund, but we were totally ignored.
