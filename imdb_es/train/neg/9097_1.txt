Who created this piece of shit? This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. It is a waste of time and money. I hate the way they create low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a story very similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the negotiation bin right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99, how silly it was to think that this could be good, instead of that I saw I dislike the stereotypes of misinterpretation of the story and the script of the first. <br /> <br /> Whoever thought this was right The video production was actually even a half decent movie where you must be in a crack or something, because I think most of the people who have seen this movie they think WHAT LOADS OF CRAP!
