This movie is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and all the crap from "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and silly. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy." This is just a horrible nonsense piece that should never have hit theaters. The jokes are not fun and the acting is horrible. Please, I beg you to save your money so you can see this piece of worthless garbage. I had to endure sitting in Little Man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. I'm disgusted that something like this is thought! Who writes this shit? The actors do NOT have talent, how do these people get to Hollywood? They are making money with this garbage!
