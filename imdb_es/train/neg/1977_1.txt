Wait, do not tell me ... they threw the movie and they took the shots. You know, this movie could have been filmed in an alley in New York. The "Gangster Bangster" I suppose. Gangster Rap, designer of gangster duster clothes, including the handkerchief that somehow moved around his neck to protect himself from dust storms on his head. I suppose it was to protect the head from the heat that seeped through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie", it seems, supplied the horsies. The scene of a bedroom where the girl was talking and the boy was saying his words ... I thought it was he who was talking. You know, watching this movie only confirms that it's not about acting anymore ... it's about appearances and it's about money. It could not have been much of that in regards to this movie. Well, in general, I think this movie will become the worst movie of all time. However, just one more thing, where was Ice T? Could he finally go to Oprah?
