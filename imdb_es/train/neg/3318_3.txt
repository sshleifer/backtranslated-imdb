How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right film for her ... Too bad she's completely out of the role. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe that it is so superficial and that the characters are not much more than cartoons. Probably it was not so easy to reduce in about 2 hours of sample approximately 600 pages of the book, but I expected more than just seeing pieces of furniture and old teacups. I sighed with relief every time I saw an actor who had not exceeded the mark of excess activity (a couple of times).
