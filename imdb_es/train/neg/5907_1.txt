Yes, that sums it up. This movie was horrible. Two minutes later I wanted to take my eyes out. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not even good for the members of that church! I do not think that any human being should be such a victim as to see a film of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, it can be said that no effort was made at all in this movie. It seems as if the horribly monotonous, bland, trite plot was launched by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift of coherent thought (at least semi-coherent). Then, there is the performance, which is sad of * all * involved. Even the cameos can not animate anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a superficial imbecile that we would like to believe can change, but that path is full of shamefully bad dialogues. horrible "gags" and many Mormon "jokes" that anyone in their right mind, SUD or not, should consider purely * stupid *! This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen!
