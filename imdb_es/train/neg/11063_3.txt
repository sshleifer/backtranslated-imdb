I have the "guts" to tell you to stay away from "Dahmer," the biopic based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer. 'Dahmer' deviates more in relation to the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and ate some of his body parts, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this horrible spectacle who should have examined their heads before deciding to give the green light to this horrible project "dahm". This is not an easily digestible movie, even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some appetizers of brainsadillas of fire or even with some "lord of real life". Potato skins'. * Failure
