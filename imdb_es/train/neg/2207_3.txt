Hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and the killer shark movie genres. In a bit of a cast, Jeffrey Combs plays the cited mad scientist who develops a human creature / hammerhead shark. Interestingly, this being is, in fact, his son, who has become this monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of associates is invited to the private island of the scientist. They end up being used as shark bait or shark companion. For some unknown reason, the IT boss has introduced himself as part of this team. Who knows why Fortunately, it turns out to be a Ramboesque hero with resources, although with a bit of overweight. I am working on the assumption that he learned to handle an assault rifle as part of his daily work in frontline support. A normal day for this computer presumably involves fixing the connection of someone's network followed by a call to shoot the evil-doers. Or maybe a call should be scheduled to fix someone's PC between physical confrontations with land-based human shark hybrids? Anyway, it's amazing and saves the day. He even gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Shark man is a little lame creation, but it's fine, I suppose, judging by the overall effects of this movie. And the movie moves at a decent pace. Of course, it's a complete hokum, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and you expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a murderous fish on land, then you really have no one to blame but you same. As it is, there are weapons, blood, girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter. It's garbage but not as bad as some would say.
