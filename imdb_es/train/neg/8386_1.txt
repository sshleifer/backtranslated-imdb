Destroying this movie is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really seemed that Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a small person. I never doubted it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Second, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his performances of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who coincidentally played with Grier's father in the 1992 Boomerang (if he remembers it, he "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So it was funny. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, this movie is as credible as White Chicks. How silly is it when even the doctor can not say that he is a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He has a complete set of teeth! How is it possible that no one seems to realize that he is not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there is a cameo by Rob Schneider. And, please, if you're stupid enough to lose $ 8 in this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your kids. This movie is too sexual for young children (lots of jokes and insinuations about sex, going to eat, going out to eat, etc.), and I felt embarrassed by the parents who took their children to the screening I had to endure. If you insist on watching an idiotic movie, at least save your children pain and suffering.
