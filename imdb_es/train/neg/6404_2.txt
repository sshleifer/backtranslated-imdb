Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams, I felt it was necessary to buy this movie as the first screen appearance. Wow ... I could not imagine a more mind-blowing movie. Essentially, the film takes a joke after another that his uncle Artie would tell him after dinner and dramatizes them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second play. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of obscene humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar, or in bad taste ... it was simply amazing. There are no redeeming qualities of this film, apart from fans of Robin Williams, like me, who simply have to own every piece of the film.
