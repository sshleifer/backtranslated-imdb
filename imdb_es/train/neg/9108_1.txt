This so-called prequel is just a new mis-version of a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The graphics are identical like most scripts. I loved the book it's based on, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the third movie. The useless joke between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can not emphasize how bad the movie was. If you do not want to trust my word, just look at it and you'll see what I want to say. If you've read a review that says 'If you like the first one, you'll like the second one', the only reason is that it's the exact same movie! Although the plot is not even so good. They took so many lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell what movie you're watching.
