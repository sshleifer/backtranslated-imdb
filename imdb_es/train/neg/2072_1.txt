I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I thought you really could not go wrong with an Ex Girlfriend concept with superpowers. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confused and meaningless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that at every step the writer was still throwing garbage. Also the writer kept throwing too much. Much humor in the bathroom and sexual situations that only a teenager could love. <br /> <br /> It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story about the superhero of Fatal Attraction ... but I guess not. <br /> <br /> This is not a funny romantic comedy as advertised. You could not take a child to see him and you would feel ashamed to see him on a date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could have made a basic story about the main concept and cleaned it up, the film could have a fighting chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
