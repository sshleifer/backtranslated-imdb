There's something good in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so forceful but it's the truth. Too bad she did not do a nude. At least it would have made this mess tolerable. We see another girl's tits, but she is not near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like garbage! "Consequence" is the usual B movie that you would expect. History had potential. It is as if they had good ideas but did not know how to execute them. The cinematography is simply horrible. Ugly! The direction is not inspired and the end result is an insipid thriller with twists and dragged actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a slut in a cheap and fucking way, but she does not even keep "Consequence" of being garbage and not funny garbage, just stinking garbage.
