Ok, where do we start with this little gem? The mutant slugs begin to take over a small town in New England (?). Only a man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if that was not ridiculous enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The images of the slugs are what are known as archive images. No matter who the slugs attack or where they are, the same shot of slug piles that ooze everywhere is shown. Keep in mind that this unique photo occupies at least half of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was shot down, dragged, steal your wallet, hit your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD. I am sure there is something worse, but it will be difficult to find it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He should have taken some night classes at the YMCA, because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> As for the horror? This movie should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are slugs to scream loudly. All the ascending action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Just look at this movie in an MST3K environment, otherwise I can see some major brain damage.
