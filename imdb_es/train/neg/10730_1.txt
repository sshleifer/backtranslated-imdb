The movie starts with 3 people who are at the bar. IN AGREEMENT. They are talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time, for no reason. Still OK. Every once in a while, they even make you laugh. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you really enjoy it! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing happens ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see are naked "old women" who touch each other. Not well. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top part of the movie, but it's all except that! The movie does not make sense, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) in FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to the research, of course, before people saw it! I even thought (before seeing): "There is, this could be interesting, although it's a Russian movie". But, God, no!
