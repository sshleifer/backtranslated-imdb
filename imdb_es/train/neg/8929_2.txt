This hodge-podge adapted from a novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers) makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like works of art by Fellini. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and actually not very tall) in a main role (except for KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was quite good) playing the alter-ego of Rex Reed (film critic, not critical), just to be surrounded by drag queen (great girl) Mae West, John Huston, a young and naive Farrah Fawcett (before Lee Majors, what a shame), and other spooky azoids who claim to be fake. It is also possible that things do not work. for this, except the clips of old films spliced ​​(ie, Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... ONLY so that they can continue to bleed everyone's lives. <br /> <br /> To 2 of each 10. Better performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
