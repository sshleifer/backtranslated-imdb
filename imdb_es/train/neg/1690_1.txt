this movie was horrible I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if they paid me. The so-called scenes of terror were incredibly predictable and had been played to excess. There really was nothing in this movie that would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 that I paid to see it. Do not see it, do not rent it, do not read it online because any of these things would be a total waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a mediocre performance and really should be ashamed of herself for having tarnished her good name with this movie. What a shame, Sarah, for being associated with this horrible and horrible movie. Horrible movie, there is no need to see it ever.
