After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about a minute. One minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then, she and two friends from the university are driving to a rock concert, after a lot of stuffing, they hit something and they get off the road. They wake up in a cabin inhabited by an old woman in a wheelchair and her offspring. The murders are sadly very docile for a supposed Nasty Video. The end of the foolish and predictable turn. No one involved in the mess would do anything remarkable again. So there are still happy endings sometimes. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley goes topless, and Laurel Munson has the whole front on screen <br /> <br /> My rating: D
