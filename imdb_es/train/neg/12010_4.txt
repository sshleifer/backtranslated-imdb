The acronym "F.P.1" means "Floating Platform # 1". The film presages the construction of an "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which will be used as an "air station" for transatlantic aircraft flights. He based a contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; it was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, the technology made the nonstop ocean voyage much more preferable. <br /> <br /> Stars Conrad Veidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage intermittently The Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed. Mr. Veidt is very fun to watch; but, he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Mrs. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The youngest co-stars were the wives of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and the film have not aged well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
