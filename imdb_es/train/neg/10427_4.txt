Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly has sex with men. She is still exploring, trying to find "more data" to be able to see what she wants from life and the men who compose it, although it seems that at her age she should already have a pretty good idea. (I can not agree, however, with someone who says that Young is too old for the role, if he is, we should grow old very well). For the most part, this movie left me cold, although it's not the worst. of your kind you will never see it. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut', at least something happens in this.
