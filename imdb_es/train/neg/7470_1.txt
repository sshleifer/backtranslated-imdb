In SÃ£o Paulo, teenagers of the upper middle class Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just entered university and, on the eve of the opening class, go to a party with drugs and alcohol. The next day, after his classes, Cristiano's date on the night before arrives at his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, startled with Gabriel and rolls the ladder, breaking her neck. The trio decides to throw and burn the corpses in a garbage dump, but throughout the night other tragedies happen. <br /> <br /> The controversial and shameful "Cat Bed" is an overrated pretentious crap about the alienation of young people. And it is without a doubt the worst Brazilian film I have seen for many years. The superficial, tragic and dark history is actually a comedy of bad taste black humor. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and stupid filming with interviews with idiotic teenagers at the beginning and end. The acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed by the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this garbage. The camera, the frame, the cinematography and the edition are amateur and of very low quality. The sound is horrible and in many places it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (it is probably an advantage, since this movie sucks). The gang bang is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sexual exploitation. My vote is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cama de Gato")
