This movie was horrible. It was very difficult for me to see this all the time. I did not understand the point of the movie. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the performance was bad and the story was not inspiring. The two main characters of the film were very boring and their dialogue was not interesting. There was no chemistry between any of the cast members. I do not know this for sure, but I suspect that most of the actors were first-timers. The movie could easily have been reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I would have preferred a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to see a good and fun movie that is family friendly and made by a group of Mormons, look at Napoleon Dynamite instead.
