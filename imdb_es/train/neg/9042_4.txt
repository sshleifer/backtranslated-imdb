I wanted to like this movie. But it crumbles in the middle. The whole premise is good and connects very well, but the center goes off the tangent. The people I observed were getting upset while they were leaving the course, and they expected it to end sooner than it did. Another person really fell asleep during the middle segment! I found myself dreaming somewhere else during Schtick's parts that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for the sweet eye and I delivered it well, but it lacks the soul and the writing of Pixar. I think that children of 8 years and younger will enjoy the ride on the stick of the face, while losing the plot. People old enough to follow a plot will find that they marvel too much to return quickly and easily. Edit most of the center section, do it 50 minutes and it would be a solid movie. I wish I had better things to say. But not me
