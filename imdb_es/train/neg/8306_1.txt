ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention it is most likely that she grows psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longs for privacy. Now the poor and rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. It is not surprising that Greta Garbo reclined and said: "I want to be alone." How much does ET do this girl? Does not ET have anything better to report? I bet there are many people who really do not care about the color of their birthday cake and balloons. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole has won any of those court cases by will and her inheritance. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
