This will be best known for the Ferrari that crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion. <br /> <br /> The history of racing and betting is poorly made by numbers that seem to have a director who could not see the numbers. Largely a matter of shooting and shooting with a group of actors in it for a paycheck. This is not a good movie, but it is not bad enough to be able to see it and end up like a movie that is not worth bothering, no matter how you see it. <br /> <br /> Misogyny, despite the fact, one of the protagonists is a woman. This is a film that was made clearly for the producer and director to approach the beautiful girls. Do you want evidence? There are long and long shots of women in almost nothing that have no other purpose than to get an increase in people who are too afraid to rent a porn movie or the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
