I have tried to see this so-called comedy, but it is very difficult to bear. This is a bad movie, narrow-minded and full of clich√©s. It's definitely not funny, but it's very boring and annoying, by the way. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time, and there's nothing more to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
