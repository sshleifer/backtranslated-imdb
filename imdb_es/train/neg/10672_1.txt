I had all the film clich√©s of this type and no substance. The plot did not get anywhere and at the end of the film I felt like a fool to see it. The production was good; However, the script and the performance were of B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed with wrinkled actors. Good actors did not defend themselves or raise others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. interpret caricatures of themselves in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for nonsensical entertainment, I still would not recommend this movie.
