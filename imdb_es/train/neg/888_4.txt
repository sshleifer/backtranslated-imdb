This was a movie that I could not wait to see! So I finally understood and was quite disappointed. For starters, the movie has little to say about New York, just a bunch of confusing photos of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really does not focus on the magic of New York. Another thing that changed my opinion was the French. The movie is inside this movie. I know it's a new version, but it's not a new version of French style! Anyway, here you will notice elements that remind you of French films, like long and messy scenes, nothing or little conversation and, of course, everyone is smoking in the French style! The story follows many lives (too many for my taste) and somehow they seem to be connected in the end. I feel there was no dedication to the characters as much as there were in the stories. The film was too short to cover all the destinations. The happy ending of all. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have your 120 minutes! If you like the dialogues of active scenes and those things, this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
