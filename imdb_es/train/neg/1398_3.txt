I bought this (it only cost $ 3, okay?) With the title "Gray matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a role that is not DukesOfHazzard intrigued me. As the other critics warned, it's a pretty boring story of a top-secret government experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are a lot of establishment shots, especially of a house with a pool in front. Some of the characters and interiors are so indescribable that the filmmakers fear that we can forget who is who, so they continue to deceive us by first showing the exterior of the buildings. Actually it's a little funny. After a while, the image of the pool feels like the identification logo of a television station, and reminds us that we are watching "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two episodes of insults. At one point, an angry test subject makes fun of someone who is in charge by calling her "bchch scientist!". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later, a different theme fades away murmuring about that "b ** tard scientist!". It just sounded very uncomfortable to me. <br /> <br /> Someday this movie will disappear forever. Within another decade, it will probably be impossible to find copies of it. Almost as if it had never happened. <br /> <br />
