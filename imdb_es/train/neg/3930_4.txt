The Second Renaissance, part 1, shows us how machines rebelled against humans for the first time. Everything begins with a single case, in which the machines claim that they also have the right to live, while humans claim that a robot is something they possess and, therefore, can do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Although it is an interesting premise, the story becomes really silly thereafter with (violent!) Riots between robots and humanity. Somehow it does not seem right, as another critic points out, everything is a bit too smart. <br /> <br /> The stories of animatrices that are kept close to the core of the matrix (in particular, Osiris) work in the best way. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I would say that it is too violent and too stupid. 4/10.
