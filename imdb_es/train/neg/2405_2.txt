This movie deserved a job at Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth a watch because it is an involuntary uproar. Really! It's worse than "Destroy all the monsters". Be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (it looks like the Shriners have been here), the obviously Norfolk polyester jacket in "Allan Quatermain", the badly stuttered David MaCallum stutter (which diverts attention from his performance even worse) , the incredibly bad process works with all the "monsters", the monsters themselves: the hand puppet that threatens the girl, the giant snake that threatens Macallum as it sinks in the oatmeal, the red eyes in the motorized crabs , the incredibly hilarious boat (oh, brother!) that seems to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredger and looks like a surplus of a child. prom ("Journey to the future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city, where they wear a Roman imperial armor but that inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet, come!), and worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with his frightening wig) touching laughing face, ah, the horror! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the French comedian, and the African boy, Sluffleupagus or whatever, evidently chose to die heroically instead of being in more scenes.
