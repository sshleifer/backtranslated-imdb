The only reason I do not give this film less than 3 stars is because it is not on par with a movie like Hands: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this movie is the fact that it is boring and terribly boring and terribly British. The premise of this film seems potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they took was not very interesting. It was more a film about research funds and ornaments than projecting lasers. The actors were wooden, impassive and distant. As was the love story between the two scientists, which was anything but intriguing. I could never tell what was the attraction between them since chemistry did not exist. Nor did I really understand why the main boy with the melty face decided to kill everyone he met. At least now I know that you should always give someone a fair hearing before you cut your research grants, otherwise they go wild and kill blindly with ridiculous hand gestures.
