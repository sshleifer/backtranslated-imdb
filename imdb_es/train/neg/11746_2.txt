Well, this movie has certainly had a lot of exaggerations; From the bustle at the Toronto Film Festival to the enthusiastic reviews on CBC Radio. An indie film refreshing, extravagant, hilarious apparently. I had been waiting for months. <br /> <br /> How can I say this simply? He sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematographic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was fun and, in the worst case, it induces coma. A miserly-directed and miserly-edited script from a sleazy mess. <br /> <br /> And what was the music with 500db higher than the rest of the sound track? That was the only really strange thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny and strange movie related to extraterrestrials, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
