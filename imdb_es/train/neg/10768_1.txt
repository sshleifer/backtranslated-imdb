This movie makes Canadians and Britons idiots, stupid idiots. Men are drugged / drunk, and then they shout / hit each other in almost every scene. Are women superfluous to history? I do not understand why they are there? They pass each scene causing an uproar, or worse, circling like hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are hairy vulgar or big hippie chicks. She's the usual girlfriend, her losing boyfriend and her wicked, foolish madness we've seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a child stereotype. Not to mention that everyone seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene involving sex with George Wendt? shudder ?? It's enough for anyone to choke! I saw the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why I would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor, the only one with a vague moment of redemption, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot? The three imbeciles trying to recover their drug? yawn - or Karl? Who is dead, but who is actually a very lively character in the minds of those who are left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? Although I am ashamed even to have thought about comparing these two films), why bother? Karl is so irritated that the circumstances of his death are gratifying. <br /> <br /> At the end of this movie, I thought everyone would have been better with him on that ship!
