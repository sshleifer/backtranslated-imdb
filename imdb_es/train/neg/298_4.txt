Daraar had a good start. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Apart from that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. The whole first half of the film is about Rishi Kapoor, in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he's a bit old for her? Things finally start to get animated towards the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and what a lunatic he is! It was an overprotective and clean monster with a really HOT TEMPERATOR! He used to beat poor Juhi without a good reason! One of the reasons I really do not like this movie is because I can not stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) being abused. This film in general has too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so disgusting! <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is that if you're thinking about renting a Daraar, you should put it back on the shelf where you found it and pick it up. anything else!
