I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to do on a Saturday night, I suppose. But what really bothers me is when the review in the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Transmitting religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT good, brother. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious person, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a disaster. Misdirected, badly performed, badly edited, and the attempt of a soundtrack was hilarious. The false accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes and the continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat in this waste of time was that it was too late to see another movie. I should have gone to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely none of the redeeming qualities of this movie, unless you're the religious type that will immediately back up anything that preaches your beliefs to unbelievers, even if it's a lot of trash. . If you are not, avoid this at all costs. Do not be fooled by the written box.
