I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope: I liked Pacino in Aroma of a woman and I have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French films and in other of the seventies and eighty. But I had forgotten how important is the role that dialogues can play in a movie, and in this film they are absolute ... garbage! The filming locations were also attractive, but the desperate, pretentious and forced dialogues took everything to the level below zero. In addition to that, I am quite allergic to the world of motorsports and I do not find any interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than the ones in this movie (and that's saying something!). I really expected something better from this movie and I was very disappointed to have been disappointed.
