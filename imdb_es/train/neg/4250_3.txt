It's like what other Dracula movies do, Dracula's henchmen always on Dracula's side, which is what disappointed me in the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first movie in which the henchman fights against his master. It is very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story is going) that only the priest or D. wins the game (we need some amazing plots!).
