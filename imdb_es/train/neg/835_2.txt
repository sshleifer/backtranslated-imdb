Having seen the Lion King and the Lion King II and thoroughly enjoyed both. I thought it might be worthwhile to see the Lion King 1.5. What a disappointment ! Disney must be desperate to earn an income. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they only picked up some fragments of material left in the editor. floor (or trash can) and stick them together to make a quick <br /> <br /> dollar. Unlike LK I and II, both had a strong history. <br /> <br /> This movie just has a story. While characters and animation are always fun to watch, there simply is not enough material for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good second-disk fills in the original offerings. <br /> <br /> Disney: What a shame to have thrown this crap to make money fast! <br /> <br /> Next time take the time and effort and put our lasting work.
