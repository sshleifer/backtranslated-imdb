What a snore-fest. <br /> <br /> Of all the pieces of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remake and update, this is by far one of the most useless. This was a totally useless show in the first place, and we REALLY do not need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> It does not matter the intolerance and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made, socially, since the program was run that the whole point of the program (if ever had one) has been lost. <br /> <br /> Also, what is the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he is not overweight?
