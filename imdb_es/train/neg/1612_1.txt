It is incredible that with all the innumerable crimes that have been unequivocally discovered and placed at the doors of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago, the Cultural Revolution and the Khmer Rouge, there are still admirers of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and They are still making propaganda in their favor. It simply shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In this particular movie, a psychotic killer is glorified. It goes without saying that neither their crimes nor their psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect the audience to feel through this seemingly endless propaganda film demonstrates the vision of the tunnel they have in relation to their object of worship.
