Wow ... without words as to the making of this movie, I can not say much. The cover in the local video library should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who get lost in the Scream set and decide to film a movie! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the performance was not in The Budget, but they were able to pay naked and handsome actors! The style about the substance almost makes its mark here, except that most of these performance class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that must go somewhere when they were reading this script. After only 4 or 5 deaths by the so-called masked assassin and a confusing plot plot about a Murder Club in which the mute lead actress believes it is a real club she can join (only if she can beat a girl who is find her self), you want to stab your hands with the closest sharp object to remind yourself never to get too excited with a possibly good movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie and I can not find anyone to take it from their hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of direct horror releases to videos without thinking about the essentials. Throw it if you bought this.
