In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He finds her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and invites her out. Your reaction to your invitation is quite rare. It was supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And that bothers me throughout this movie. It was not so fun. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only jokes I liked were about a waiter's teeth, but after several times, even that started to get boring. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a sexy girlfriend called. This was a strange relationship! A girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a child, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a bad time, but we all know that Paresh can not do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, is even supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> I only like movies that are really fun. I guess I'll never see this movie again.
