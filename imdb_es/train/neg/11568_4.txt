This British boiler has one thing in its favor: young people are uniformly good looking. The older men are of opinion, the Right Thatcherites, whose behavior returns all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years. However, young or old, morality in this three-part miniseries is universally suspect and no one is particularly good. <br /> <br /> Nick is a young handsome young man just arrived from Oxford. It's not critical to the story, but it has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair that makes it a lot easier to see this nonsense. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father, Gerald is a conservative and wealthy politician, and takes care of his sister Cat while the family has fun in the south of France. She is not informed that when she is upset, Cat cuts herself with a variety of knives and other cooking utensils. Nick confuses his selfish "gratitude" for affection and moves away, discovering too late how much he is despised and haunted. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years, but since the plot depends on this point, it is better not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick is more pleasant to watch, it is unbearably obsequious. His shy submission to the rich fanatics soon made me climb the walls. Deeply closed, except for Cat (she guesses her great secret in sight), she likes a little bit of anonymous sex just so we know she's really gay. Although it seems hard to do, Nick takes a lover who is even more closed than him. <br /> <br /> The supercilious Tories despise and insult the two blacks in the movie, so imagine the venom that spits when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid newspaper. Gerald, in the style of Tory, has been involved in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick increase his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one last chance to punish the helpless child. <br /> <br /> Except for a brief moment of outrage, Nick takes the abuse upon him silently and tacitly agrees. Denial, self-deprecation, naivete or ignorance? You decide, if you can manage to sit through all this without throwing something on the set.
