Before watching "Dahmer", I thought that no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To summarize "Dahmer," it's a story about a gay serial killer who presents almost no murder and consists almost entirely of Dahmer's encounters with homosexual men before being killed. Can not find a plot, and is useless to tell us something about "Dahmer." All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible writing, all horrible ... If you have to choose between seeing "Dahmer" and throwing up a projectile for three hours, go with the vomit ... it will be less painful ...
