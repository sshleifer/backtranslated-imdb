This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I saw it at the premiere of SXSW and I was very disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said it at the premiere. This is a drama, but people were laughing at how corny the movie was. That is never a good sign. The only graces of salvation were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as roommates / companions of Livien. They were fun, while the rest of the movie was taken too seriously. The corny fall of the Beatles lyrics was absurd. However, the soundtrack was excellent and it was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of those crazy and rabid fans of Dominic Monaghan, do not worry about this.
