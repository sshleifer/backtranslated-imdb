I do not know why this has the fans and I do not know why I gave him the score I have. This is absurd. There are many giallos in which one has to suspend disbelief, let the image roll and reach it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor cop has to explain what we have seen. But, this has very little in its favor and has too long sequences in which nothing happens and have no relevance at all, while we have to listen to a more repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. It is not a giallo, this is a complete mix of horror ideas that presents Klaus Kinski in one of his most notorious "phone call" performances. I admit that he showed up, did a day job and left, letting Mr. D'Amato see to it that others fill up. Ewa is, of course, pretty, but it is not enough, and in the end we have seen too much of its outbreak all over the place, long after we have completely lost interest in this intrepid and pretentious slice. Maybe he just was not in a good mood!
