The Japanese feel of rhythm, editing and musical score should be different to American tastes, but surely this movie could have been much more with a little more post-production work. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood needs to reappear. Make this movie and I think it would be a great success. The story is interesting and scary. There is something on the edges of the city, sandy cops, earthquakes, sanitariums and mysterious saltwater murders that are enough to captivate. However, this story has to have some sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the effect of the "sixth sense" was in full force in this film, and that was evident from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In its current form, only lovers of Japanese films should be bothered to see this film so boring.
