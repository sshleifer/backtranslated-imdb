Cast for die for in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying, but before leaving, she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that looks and feels like expectations of being a great movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses, so it seems to be more than just the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as such, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all with good performances) you expect more than a weeping story that is a little more than a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
