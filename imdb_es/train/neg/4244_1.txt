Contrary to my principles, let me first come to a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of "art" and I am still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my strongest vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that "44 Minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely it happens to me The fact that I paid for that does not make me feel better, as well as the fact that the film deserved the high user rating here. <br /> <br /> So, what's wrong with the movie? He has a fashion title - "44 Minutes". One first thinks of "15 minutes", which by the way is a much better movie, but it is still bad in my book, and in fact the two can be compared to some extent. But, according to luck, the things they share are its worst characteristics. Both have Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously meets popular expectations and prejudices. Its purpose is to appeal to the mind of the Cold War. Oh, we miss the good old days. Now, I do not insist that he is a bad actor, I still have to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. How anyone can continue to indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The point in the film when Taktarov explains to his partner that the Romanians are not Germans, and that they are in the United States is really ridiculous. Should we assume that the unfortunate duo's greatest desire is to become "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then, there is the problem of the media. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should have made us feel the rhythm of the alleged 44 minutes. Instead, he bores us with interviews throughout the film, like in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes, the theme of the media is the central theme. The point is presented in a way that a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, now we are focusing on 44 minutes. So, I've been trying to identify the purpose of this movie. What is it? To provide a good time for the audience? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Depict violence? Oh, yes, the officer gives the Bible to the delinquent minor. So, should he promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I only know that I did not enjoy any of this. <br /> <br /> Oh, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I expected it to be a bright spot, but I was wrong. Although it is not your fault. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing "firepower" with "will power" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines I've heard. <br /> <br /> To summarize, in The scale 1-10, I give it a pure, unadulterated 1.
