Well, first of all, I did not sit down to watch the premiere of the "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying through space. that's how a normal episode of Enterprise works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something like the lines of that and wants to look closer but could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 sends a shuttle to the nebula and the shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are happening due to the stupid mistakes of Archer Oh, and did you watch the preview of an episode that shows Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode, but after that I gave up Enterprise completely and turned to television immediately. Come on!!!! This is Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was with the banana slug? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave her for some stupid reason. Okay, well, a little silly to bring your pet in space, but whatever. Well, that's what I thought until they left him on a desert planet! A BANANA PATA CAN NOT LEAVE IN A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these writers? <br /> <br /> Anyway, just say if Enterprise is in ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Do not?
