I imagine that the young people involved in the creation of "Necromancy" (also known as "The Witching" plus a lot of other titles) must have felt a little weird on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian work ("The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people to think that the aliens were invading ("The War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the best film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles starred in a third class film about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is not creative at all. Much nudity, but the background music is always really distracted. Even if the film was not particularly predictable, it was not worth seeing either. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, during the last thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and presented the documentary "The man who saw tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend those two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
