It always amazes me how different people are and how in almost every film both extremes are presented. The people who believe that it is the best movie and the one that thinks it is the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmas would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First the sound. The producers spent more time in the soundtrack than in the edition. It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and nobody spoke, and then, when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, she could hardly be heard. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like Patrica and Gaberial, but both were Piso in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Calm, very painful, or very angry, has stigmata. The first was the predominant, the second had to do with cries of pain, the third with the raising of the voice. It was the sonority that distinguished the three and not the emotion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the deep meaning and secondary arguments that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible filming and the MTV style. When you watch a 3 minute video, you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story. In a 2-hour movie, it's nauseating. I do not see the meaning of it when the women cross the floor and drop a child. And there is no Pittsburg that does not rain so often! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been thought, but it was spent all the budget in buying music and equipment to make a slow rain. Shooting and renting that huge apartment in the one that lived Mrs. Arquett, ended up saying goodbye to the guy with the story.
