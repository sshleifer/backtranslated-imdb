An absolute smoking stack of cow dung. It's amazing to me that this movie has been made. Hip hop and old westerns do not seem to mix. What were these people thinking about when planning this train of war? <br /> <br /> The concept and the plot are not only a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were up to this nightmare. The film makes their careers a laughing action. The clueless girl should never be forgiven and all the remaining dignity she had was taken away. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, I should have been asking which of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I found a list of some other actors that happened in this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br> In short, I would rather watch a blank television than watch this movie again.
