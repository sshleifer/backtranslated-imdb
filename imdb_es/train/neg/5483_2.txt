I just lost four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a movie surpasses me. But even more surprising were the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian critics gave to this movie. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and low budget. It's as if they expected the Canadian films to be terrible, so they give it a good review independently. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: the performance was below average (with the exception of the main male character, which was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, which I suppose could be expected from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the main characters, a drug trafficker who flirts with one of his clients so that he can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for his gang, whose sole purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Supposedly many of the bikes of their gang members are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how you can not buy new ones, since it is supposed to be a great drug trafficking connection from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> Anyway, the point of the story (which is not revealed until more than half of the movie) is that the drug trafficker plans to build fire bomb buildings in the Toronto area to try to make the houses more affordable, as not one will want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - Need I say more. <br /> <br /> What a shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for supporting it and The Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such biased criticism. <br /> <br /> A film should not receive special treatment just because it is Canadian!
