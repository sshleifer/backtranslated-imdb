This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. I can not express how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience to end the pain. I recommend that instead of watching this movie, you bathe in acid, at least you will know a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had so many expectations when I read the back of the DVD. In the beginning, he added that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... then, in the end, I wanted to kill myself. I mean an introduction of twenty-three minutes to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... ONLY PAIN! The monkeys could have done a better job of editing this garbage. At least they would have thrown away feces and blurred some of the garbage. It would have been better not to have seen anything of horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not understand the jokes, it was that not only were they not funny, but they repeated themselves like twenty. times. Apparently, something is not fun unless you see it a million times. <br /> <br /> Do not under any circumstances see it. People have labeled 'Manos de manos de destino' as the worst movie in the world. I have also seen it and I agree that it is bad ... but WINGS is only the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is much worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves a pretty hard language, but I can not write that here, so I guess I swore a lot.
