This movie, like the first one ("The Man From Snowy River") has the same good and bad characteristics, maybe even more than the original one. Unfortunately, the bad overcomes the good. <br /> <br /> The GOOD - Magnificent scenery, better than the first movie. I love those field photos in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a nice guy, like "Jim Craig." Bruce Rowland also did a good job with the music. <br /> <br /> The BAD: once again, we get an extremely detestable feminist heroine "Jessica" (Sigrid Thornton), who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying Cara and manners about her. In this movie, we also get a big drop in who pays the father. Previously he was Kirk Douglas, now replaced by the always profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of which, it's a disgrace that a Walt Disney movie includes the uses of the Lord's name in vain. That was one of the reasons why almost all the tubes were lost in the eighties. This movie, like the first one.
