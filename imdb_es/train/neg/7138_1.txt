Acting is horrible. This movie makes Fast and Furious look like an Academy Award-winning movie. They throw some tits and butts there to try to keep you interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and exaggerated story. There is a reason why people on the Internet are not even downloading this movie. This movie went down like an iron mob. DO NOT waste your time renting or even downloading it. This movie is and always will be a PERMA-TURD. Now I'm stupider for having seen it. In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling it a movie is a sham and an insult.
