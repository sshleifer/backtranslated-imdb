I missed the beginning of this movie, which could explain why I did not like it that much. On the other hand, I have studied the fall of the Roman Republic for years, so I know the story. On the other hand, that could also be the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they would try to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that sometimes they do everything possible to be historically accurate and end up being confused. How to throw the marriage of Antonius to Octavia, and then put it aside two scenes later. Why even mention it if it does not work for the plot and Octavia is not even seen? And how to call Antonio by his real name (Marco Antonio) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Despite historical inaccuracies aside, the movie could have been an entertaining watch. If it were not for the protagonist. There is not an ounce of dignity in it. It is hysterical, dramatic and completely without control over itself. Instead of being an intelligent and composed queen, Cleopatra becomes a hysterical teenager with a bad case of premenstrual syndrome. 95% of that comes from poor performance, but 5% also comes from bad script writing. There are too many stupid dramatic scenes written in the script. Sometimes you were not watching Antonius and Cleopatra, you were seeing immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek." <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, look ... anything but this.
