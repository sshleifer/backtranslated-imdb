It's as if a bad TV show from the 80s broke loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my God, it was bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was nothing to talk about. Something about a stalker, I suppose. In the end it shoots itself? It is not very clear, but somehow there is a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason why my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to move quickly towards the scenes with him, that could hardly be seen in that. Thank God I did not spend money on that, but I want to recover that time of my life.
