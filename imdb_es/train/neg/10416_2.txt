Before watching this movie, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done. Now it is everything but one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his performance. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, or ignorant, or clich√©. The same goes for the stereotypes of Randy Quaid. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not an actor strong enough to carry this drenched mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the landscape. It's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of independent and extravagant films, but this is just terrible.
