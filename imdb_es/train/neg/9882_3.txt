There are exactly 2 good things to say about "Fantasies" (both also mentioned by a previous critic): <br /> <br /> a) The extraordinary beauty inspired by the poetry of Bo Derek. She has shots in this movie where she gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a great compliment. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) The configuration of the Greek island, with its sun and crystalline blue waters. <br /> <br /> Another more than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and, sometimes, unintentionally, funny ("It touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a jerk. Bo exaggerates his character's naivety, but then when you have to work with such a bad dialogue, it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she has said the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a major irritation) . Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is almost no Greek word to be heard: everyone, from children to old people, seems to speak English all the time. (*)
