This is the biggest piece of junk of all time. It seems that they spent more time, effort and money making the cover of the DVD than in the real movie. I really thought that the DVD had been changed with someone's homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors on the cover. This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred dollars and a camcorder and they spent half of it on rats. The image is very clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, the cinematography, if you can call it that, the production, the performance, if that's really what they're doing, and the script, if they had it, makes this movie looks worse than an old porn. At least the old porn has a point. It seems that some PETA members came together and decided to make a really disturbing and meaningless PSA about the rights and feelings of animals. This is not worth money or time. It has nothing in common with the real BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be happy that I'm not free yet, or I could have gone after them just to ruin this movie so badly.
