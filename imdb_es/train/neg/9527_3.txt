I've been trying to trace this movie by simply looking in Google for bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and kill man at home" and so on. I think I saw parts of this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old when it was running on a cable. He made a great impression! It's the kind of movie that kids know they should not see, and they change channels when their parents come in. When I saw who the cast was, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. . On the other hand, if you enjoy watching men who cheat on their wives, this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there are some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest ending of all time, but still ... memorable.
