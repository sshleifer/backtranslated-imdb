I do not know what this is all about ... This is really a bad movie ... it did not do anything to me, the only descent scene is where everyone gathers at the party, and a good song is playing, an encouraging rhythm and nice. cinematic shots that make you move ... that was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie lacks everything to suck the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think about as some people say, there is no cohesion between different stories ... it was more than an attempt to redo Anderson's 'Magnolia', which was brilliant, but flagrantly fails ... It's Well, it's light and easy to see, but that's also film. Maybe first write a story before making a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen
