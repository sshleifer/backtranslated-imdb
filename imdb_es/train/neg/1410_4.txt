A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy director's cousin to drop him off in a poor Latino neighborhood in Carlson to investigate the work of a small supermarket manager. Go to the magnificent Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and feel attracted by his skill. His driver never catches him again and Scarlet gives the actor a ride. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her prepare; Then they spend the afternoon together enjoying a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 elements or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget film does not seem to have a story, and is backed by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and, in reality, nothing happens in 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his world of the silver spoon and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. Was she afraid of having an affair with her and destroying her perfect world with her family? Or was it a clash of classes, and he realizes that his elegant neighborhood would not be suitable for a simple worker of the lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A star in my life")
