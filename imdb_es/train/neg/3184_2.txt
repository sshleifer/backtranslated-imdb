Anyway, JD has never impressed me, and Final Justice (which I had not seen before its MST3k broadcast) is no exception. It's not that the character is less sympathetic than Mitchell: it's just that Geronimo ("Call me 'Heronimo') does not like it. <br /> <br /> In fact, one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of a agent in search of revenge from Joe Don who tries to make the "star" die by inducing a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don must have found a new agent, since he is now graduated in "comic relief" in James Bond movies The problem is that it is difficult to distinguish the difference between their comedy characters there and their "serious" characters in their action movies like this. <br /> <br /> As for the plot .. .umm, what plot? They repeat the same scenes so repeatedly that you think you were watching Groundhog Day 2. Presumably, the fact that they continue to use the same scene of Geronimo coming out of jail is a comic relief Ummm, yes, whatever it is. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the landscape of M High is quite beautiful, so I put it to 2 for me. One suspects this f However, licking Maltese tourism receded a couple of decades.
