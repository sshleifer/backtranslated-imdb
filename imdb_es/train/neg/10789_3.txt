If you expect to see much in the Altıoklar bathroom, as promised by the label line, you will be very disappointed to see that the film consists solely of Altıoklar's populist style with respect to the most famous subjects such as sex, marriage. and the deception. For much nudity, what seems to appear out of nowhere and has no connection with the argument, proves that Altıoklar failed to "try something new," as he has cited. For many, the jokes centered on sex seem to show that Altıoklar had fallen in love with the famous saying that "sex sells". I expected to see a very good story told with a very good storytelling technique. However, in the end I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and watching the Altıoklar experiment, although I was still very focused on the work of popularism.
