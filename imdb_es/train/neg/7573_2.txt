This movie is a vehicle for the clone of Schwarzenegger, Alexander Nevsky. His charisma, however, is insufficient to raise this film above the level of his poor script. He has little to add to his act of Arnie. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic as the diplomat supplicant. Seeing him return to see his D'Artagnan-act since he was a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> History is full of holes and inexplicable relationships; The top of this bill is Vlad's informant, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context he seems to be working for a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place long after the end of In the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. Contrary to that, Vlad is allowed to drive a prop vehicle as a police vehicle. The action scenes are badly taken and, therefore, lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that needs to be seen ...
