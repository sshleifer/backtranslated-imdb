I thought maybe a movie with a cast that included Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews would be worth seeing. Oh, I was wrong. Complete pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with O'Toole and York acting in an exaggerated way. I saw it twice and I still have no idea what it was. I have the feeling that O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle that has a problem with drinks and likes to relive children's games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But aside from that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redemption feature at all. I can only assume that the cast and the director were blackmailed to make this lugubrious, unimaginative, concise. Clearly a waste of time from a talented cast and director. Laughable.
