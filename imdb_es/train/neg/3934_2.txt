I expected to see this movie and see these great actors perform. However, unfortunately I was disappointed with the script and the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, was the doctor in history who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a nightclub and was able to use his medical expertise to help an injured client and was assisted by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Taking Lives", '04, who is immediately attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to act in excess in most of the scenes and becomes completely crazy trying to avoid that the members of his gang are assassinated. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series," plays a great supporting role and introduces a true COOL DUDE who is the so-called bodyguard of Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attract lots of attention from all men. This movie is not the best, but it does entertain.
