Definitely, this is not one of Lucio Fulci's best movies in any sense of the imagination. The plot is pretty bad, a millionaire is killed and Spirt asks his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie), he wondered why someone should care. The father is presented as a great imbecile to all the people he met (including the daughter he asks to help him), which made it difficult for someone to care who killed him. But nobody really sees a Fulci movie in search of a good story, to do so would be like watching a porn movie for an incredible script and performance. Typically, his films try to compensate for this by adding excessive gore scenes, but even that is not found in this movie. If you're looking for a good Fulci movie, check out The Beyond.
