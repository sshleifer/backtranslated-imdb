Unknown creature is the correct word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Film. This movie is a piece of shit from the beginning. It has a "plot", a "plot", a really pathetic "performance" and some very stupid "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some "post-adolescents" in their mid-thirties are trapped in the forest with a crazed, reptilian creature in a rubber suit lurking incessantly. What you get with this movie is a lot of talk and precious little action. You have girls walking through the woods talking, and then you have guys (with the mascara on them) walking through the woods talking. Everything is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is seldom seen throughout most of the movie. When shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the reason for the blur and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in ANYONE since the word and those who are here who praised it are the people who were picked up from the street to "act" in this really amazing movie! Skip this by the way!
