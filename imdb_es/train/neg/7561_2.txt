Anyone not aware of the 1973 original film The British Lion 'The Wicker Man' would have left the cinema with the impression of 'Poor' and 'Peurile'. <br /> <br /> As a devotee of the original I Remained with the Purely Poor impression. <br /> <br /> From the grim reality of the bargained toothed races that draw the force of law and order into a network of pagan barbarian rituals on a remote Scottish island, called Summerisle (the original) for a reminiscence by of the Amazonian colony on the coast of Maine in the USA. UU., Called Summersisle, the new version just arrives at the place. <br /> <br /> This is, unfortunately, a case of what 'could' have been a new classic version of a classic that has been manipulated to cater to a simple-minded audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) Ladies involved ... duck their heads in shame.
