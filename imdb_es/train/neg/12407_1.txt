Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a live singer for the young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continually visits her grave (located in a cemetery just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> < This starts well with a really mysterious sequence in the cemetery ... then it crumbles. The story is thin and there are TONS of filler for the movie to last 85 minutes. The acting is terrible in all areas (with Cole easily being the worst). Misdirected with some of the worst editions I've seen in a movie. The scenes (and the sound) are cut without rhyme or reason. In addition, the film has a terrible (and obvious) postproduction sound. <br /> <br /> Regarding blood and violence, forget it! There is very little and what there is seems incredibly false. I have NEVER seen such a fake blood, it looks like ketchup! Bored, meaningless - a legitimately forgotten drive-in movie. You can omit this.
