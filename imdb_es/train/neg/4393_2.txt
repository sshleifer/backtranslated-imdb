I did not like Frosty's returns and this one. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been made, but the return of Frosty was worse than this because of the snowman they drew. The land of the winter wonders of Frosty was great and so was the moving original Drama. The only good thing about this movie was that Frosty, the snowman, looked like the classics of the 60s and a funny line like when they talked about things that are not real and then Frosty walks through the window buzzing, whistling what was doing it but everything else was poorly written and badly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the cover of the DVD in the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked horrible, so I did not pick it up until this year because the images in the back seemed a little moving but I played this movie. It was a poor nuisance for the art characters like the DVD and it was terrible what was happening. I saw it at night and it seemed boring for me to fall asleep (Wait, I always do when I see something while I go to sleep) But this movie was boring in general <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Grade -C < br /> <br /> This is like another bad holiday scam on frost returns and this one. This is the bad 4th sequel like Home alone 4, so I thought the movie was fine, but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone, 3 and 4 people hate it like that. My sister did not see it much because when she came into my room to see him for 2 and a half minutes, she walked away like "I hate animation!" I agree with her just like the third Frosty comes back. Simply horrible!
