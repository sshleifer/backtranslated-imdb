After watching the movie, I was very surprised to see such a high rating in IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaptation of a beloved children's classic, which portrays the history of Slise's history. the protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') while trying a 'last' heist to steal the feared Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, another lean, or whatever. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where to start with my criticisms. <br /> <br /> Well, I 'In my late teens and I was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I really like his material, having read some of his books as a child and I saw Matilda, Charlie and the factory chocolate again and again. This film, however, fights for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults I'm still insecure! Many of the "jokes" bore a child, especially when Mr. Fox visits a lawyer, for example, or complains about being poor. In addition, an audience of (I suppose) children is expected to sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm in favor of the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting his neck! Surely that is a bit too much? And also, the plot ... well, it's a bit boring. I was left alone hoping it would improve, but instead I got more and more upset with Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> The humor, meanwhile, deflates. I only laughed once or twice, although I recognized specifically the attempts at jokes. I think part of this is that the voice acting is incredibly flat and monotonous. The voice actors have no sense of comic time, but seek the subtlety of humor that only works with certain media. George Clooney pretends to show Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not even realize that Bill Murray played a role until the end of the credits, and Ash, twelve years old in the fox years, sounds like he's about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love Animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style really scared me a bit. The characters are tall, thin and lacking in design warmth. They move with very little fluency and, often, the animation is choppy and strange. There is also a distinctive "mixed medium" feel, since the 2D components are added sporadically and without success. The characters look directly at the camera and talk; It was very uncomfortable There were one or two moments when Kylie looked directly at the camera, did not move and had swirls in her eyeballs. Actually, I got scared. <br /> <br /> The fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. A lot of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just was not for me.
