It is possible that the first scanners were not a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty in this. The acting is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. I did not either. as the dialogue. And the special effects are not better than in the original. This movie is inferior to the first in all aspects. The only thing different from this is that it is loud and chaotic at times. But it is not like that. It's a good movie. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, it could have been a decent movie. Actually, I could not have overcome it without doing it. For me, this is forgettable. Film, and not much more. In spite of everything, there are worse movies. Being in a generous mood, I will give Scanners 2 a 4/10.
