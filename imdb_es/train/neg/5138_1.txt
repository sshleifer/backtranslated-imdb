I saw SCARECROWS because of the buzz that surrounded him. Well, I can not imagine anyone who likes this movie because it's bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that whoever made this movie knows nothing about the horror. The whole story is a failed marriage of two genres: action film (weapons and criminals) and horror (live scarecrows). When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky-looking scarecrows, the two genres are automatically canceled because, first, they are criminals and who cares about the criminals, and second, because they are stupid criminals! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does not work here. Where is the horror in that? He wanted the criminals to die horrible and painful deaths. <br /> <br /> But the story is so poorly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if handled well, NEVER gets bigger. We just stand with a group of super-dense criminals and a group of scarecrows, who are "alive" for whatever feeble reason the filmmakers thought. To make matters even worse, the fact that cinematography is terrible (like television) and, what is worse than all, is the dialogue in CBs, and we continuously listen to inane dialogues about disconnected images as if we were watching something type of radio program. This part was really bad. The director should have been shot on the spot for having such a stupid idea! I can not tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, SCARECROWS criminals are incredibly stupid. For example, when someone appears suddenly, disemboweled and full of money and straw (yes, straw) in their huge open wound, the others ask "What drug is it?" after they shot tons of bullets in him, unable to kill him (the scarecrows have "turned him into a zombie." Do not ask ...). Get a damn track, assholes. I've never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there's the girl. I wished that one of the scarecrows would have killed her quickly because her butt ached. When he finds his father stuck in a "cross" of scarecrows, he actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene (bad performance), although the criminals could not have done it. How silly she was! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak film. They are not scary. Nothing is explained much about them. They are just a plot device in this movie full of raster devices. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds without stopping causes nothing but pure boredom. And that scene with the head talking in the fridge. Thanks for the laugh <br /> <br /> In general, this had to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I've seen many movies these days!) Among the equally unfortunate SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS, I prefer to see the SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS is so bad.
