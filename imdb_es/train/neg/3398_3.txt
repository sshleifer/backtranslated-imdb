It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive character (similar to the maffia) of the Russians, or at least of the Russians who can travel outside their great country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so inefficient that they can not find the person who stole the bank even when these subjects leave the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by foreigners in the Ural Mountains, but it is far from being Russian. So, Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep busy learning the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
