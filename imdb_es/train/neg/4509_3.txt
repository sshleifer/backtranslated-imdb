"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that looks more like a camp, a drag queen satire than anything else that has to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film continues to defend defensively that the geishas are not prostitutes and prostitutes, who are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But aside from an impressive dance, the rest of the film degenerates into "Pretty Baby" in the territory of Storyville, or at least Vashti and Esther in the Purim story, since all the efforts of women in art and artifice are entertaining. Much, much older, Drunken drunks. Maybe it's the Japanese culture that is being prostituted, and not just the American fans after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the tension of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang shows just a little of the great flare she has. demonstrated in "House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu)" and "Hero (Ying xiong)". Michelle Yeoh occasionally projects a glimpse of her assured performance in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)." Only Li Gong shows some real life. Otherwise, I kept imagining Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the kabuki theater, particularly when the plot crawled into cat fights after cat fights. <br /> <br /> The alleged love story has no chemistry, mainly due to age differences, and most of all I lamented Ken Watanabe and I expected his Hollywood paycheck to compensate for his loss of dignity as the mysterious " President". I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jennie" since the girl is anxious to grow up in Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with normal women as photographers. attractions, and as an elderly Ziyi Zhang lives the war years in a very colorful kimono death operation. The end has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The score includes many traditional melodies, with Yo Yo Ma's violoncello and Yitzhack Pearlman's violin instead of traditional instrumentation, which are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment. The beautiful cinematography, as long as one completely ignore the plot and the rigid performance. <br /> <br /> While my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would have treated this story, which probably would have been more formal, but much more emotional.
