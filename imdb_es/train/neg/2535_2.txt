Like last year's event, WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was led by a match of the Elimination Chamber. However, the difference between the previous years and those of this year was the value of entertainment. Actually, only three people had the opportunity to leave the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. Those men were the current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way for Vinnie Mac to strap on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious that he was not going to be the only one either. Last year's game was exciting with six of the best WWE offers. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing event, but it is still the match of the night by far. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the night came after the bell had been run in the main event. He turned Vince McMahon himself and demanded that they raise the camera. It was then announced that Edge was collecting his money in the bank's championship at that time. With no time to prepare and just after winning the Elimination Chamber match, John Cena had no chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining WWE heels. This was the only entertaining action that happened all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was really atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show organized a snoring festival that made me struggle to stay away. HHH picked up the victory, but that was never a real doubt, right? Any pay-per-view that has Jerry Lawler and Viscera fighting on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success it really does. The king covered Helms (who reserves these things?) And Big Vis proved the defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> WWE women also had a very busy night. There was the usual nonsense of Diva with a game of Bra and Panties Gauntlet that was won by Ashley and the Women's Championship was also at stake. In a game, I thought I would have been allowed to prepare until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good game. Trish won the contest, but it was evident that this will continue in the immediate future. <br /> <br /> The opening night contest will soon be the WWE Champion against the Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better, but it was a battered and bloody style that remained after a final disqualification. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So the New Year's Revolution initiated the 2006 pay-per-view calendar disastrously. The only good thing about this is knowing that for the WWE the only way is to go up. They do not get worse than this.
