I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean He is the only presence that is worthwhile in this movie. But still, I do not see this movie. Even though he is a good villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and, in fact, I did not really care if the lovers of the cross star ended up together or died. The movie did not make me worry or BELIEVE that these people cared about each other at all. I have read many "classic" novels after watching the movies and this movie did not make me want to read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better at that. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has excellent movies from novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like the Forsyte saga. Check them out, do not bother with Lorna Doone.
