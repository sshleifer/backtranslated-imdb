Despite its impressive cast and crew, Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot is complicated in an unrealistic way, the actors have bad accents and the participation of director Robert Altman is equivalent to collecting a paycheck. Once again, he has put together an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman), which on this occasion the letter is a mistake. But that is only part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a prominent Georgian lawyer who, in the opening scenes of the film, is absurdly seduced by a mysterious waitress from a catering company who convinces him. He is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a crazy father. With red flags everywhere, the shrewd lawyer struggles even to get his children hurt. The fights of arms and fists follow the necessary pursuit of a car and, if that is not enough, a hurricane is launched for the ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with an unconvincing and unconvincing southern accent. Running in a raincoat in all kinds of weather, is blind to the obvious to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as a P.I. But with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely, they all grew crazier than a bed bug that serves thick slices of ham, but at least his touch is plausible. The female protagonists (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are thin and have no engine. Even the famous lawyers who make cameos (Vernon Jordan) are made of wood with the few pull lines they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying little attention to its actors, Altman's staging that drips with Spanish moss is murky and Shapeless, its action scenes are comics. It lacks its unconventional touches and observations (he informs the viewer that Stars and Bars are still flying in Georgia) that make a well-made Altman so unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman at its worst, even if the pay is the same.
