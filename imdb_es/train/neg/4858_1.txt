Why would someone in the world make this garbage movie? The first two films of Zombie Bloodbath were stupid enough, but this takes the cake to the worst of the trilogy (Maybe of all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but he is no longer the scriptwriter, which is neither negative nor positive, considering he is as untalented as the guy who wrote this one. The writing depends too much on the word f, which is used between 200 and 300 times in nausea. The acting is on par with the last two Bloodbath films, so naturally, it's one of the worst I've seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look great. The plot has become too complicated for its own sake, and it was a government experiment that went awry and zombies were produced. It also includes a cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school children who know how to travel through time, which leads to one of the most idiotic endings I've seen. After the movie, it's about shots, which is strange because this whole movie is a proposal. Just see this to make fun of him, because if you go into this with a serious mind, you may kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: PUMP / ****. 95 minutes
