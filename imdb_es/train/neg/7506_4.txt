Good actors and good performances can not mask a meaningless script, bad dialogue and spiraling behavior patterns in anything that matters to you. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. There is no character development, there is no growth, there is no interest, only a suffering without any particular reason, it does not teach us anything and it does not even bother to entertain.
