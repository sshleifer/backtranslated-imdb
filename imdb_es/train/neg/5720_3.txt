Some gorehound friends recommended "Live Feed" to me, and basically I can not complain, since the film certainly offers a lot of oddments and buckets full of sleaze, but of course it's not a very good movie. Ryan Nicholson, more than obviously taking advantage of the latest trend in horror films, the so-called Torture Porn, tries to outperform all the other films in this subgenre (and that includes the models "Hostel" and "Saw") with their patients. and twisted makeup effects and totally depraved shots of naked nude co-eds, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no real plot to describe. Five friends in their twenties in total mistrust make a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but apart from that, I do not really know why they chose to travel there instead of Cancun. Clearly, they are not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause a hectic scene when they witness the slaughter of a puppy puppy in the market. The quintet is subsequently submerged in the rugged nightlife and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. A simple apology is clearly not enough, since the gangster follows them to an adult theater and gradually subjects them to cruel torture. A girl is impaled and another poor girl even has a poisonous snake thrust through her throat; Yikes "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and amateur production values ​​are pretty hard to miss, even if you're used to watching independent amateur movies like this one. The fat guy on the cover, an oriental hangman from S & M, is pretty good and he's also the most talented of all, because at least he keeps his mouth shut all the time. I would not recommend exactly this pile of filth, but hey, if you like loud and horrible metal music, nauseating torture scenes and foolish losers, go ahead and watch!
