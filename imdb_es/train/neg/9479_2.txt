This movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the performance seemed solid, the dialogue was not too rigid ... but after about twenty minutes in this long scene with a doctor who, in reality, is a patient in the asylum who claims to be a doctor. it just goes south from there. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the devil is about the freak that seems dumbest from the thing that looks like Godzilla in Curse of the Demon. There are also some strange demon worshipers wearing masks that look like exploding teenagers since the beginning of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cinematography could not save this movie. Despite some fairly solid performances by the actors, the story simply does not go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for this.
