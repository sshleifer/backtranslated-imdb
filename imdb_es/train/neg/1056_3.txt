Diana Guzm√°n is an angry young woman. Surviving a series of relentless disappointments and traumas, it eliminates your anger with the closest targets. <br /> <br /> When he sees that violence is transformed and focuses on discipline in a ruined boxing club, he knows he has found his home. <br /> <br /> The film progresses from there, while Diana learns the coming-of-age lessons along with the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good on paper, especially when she transmits the concentrated fury of a young woman cornered on all sides and fights not only against personal circumstances but also because of ingrained sexism. <br /> <br /> The image could be very delicate. it is the direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the oldest and most experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which reduces the dramatic tension. The general tranquility of the film drains it of intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good image to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the "see it again and again" category.
