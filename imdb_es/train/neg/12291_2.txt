Humm, an Italian film starring David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest and, in fact, I took even less than I expected. It does not mean that this movie is the worst I've seen because I've seen worse than this, but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting and some good bloody scenes are the only thing that saves this. Apart from that, you will love some special effects, they are really corny and bad. Now I just want to see "Troll 3" from this same director, sure it will not be worse than that.
