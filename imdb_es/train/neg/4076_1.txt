This theme deserves a much better script, and the final result, that this film serves. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather as a series of interwoven nightmare scenarios. The gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. The scene in which the abduction victim is told that her parents are not dead and that they have been looking for her since they kidnapped her, is simply strange. It is written as a moment of cathartic therapy with the head of the refuge for fugitives handing him a "lost poster" from when he was eight years old. In the real world, if the head of a fugitive shelter discovered that he had a resolute kidnapping under his roof, what he would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. It's a problem of law enforcement, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so brief that I can only come to the conclusion that the first 90 minutes were for a pure free exploitation. It's funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. In the end it seems to have joined.
