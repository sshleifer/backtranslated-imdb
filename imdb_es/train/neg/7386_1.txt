I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it on three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's voice change? Did he die during filming and did the studio have to copy the sound with someone who does not even look like him? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the actor's real voice. Although throughout most of the film, it seems that the audio was recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if I had a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I will review this database before renting more of your movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. Usually, you knew what you got when you saw a Steven Seagal movie. I guess that's not anymore.
