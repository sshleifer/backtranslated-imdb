This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, there is no context for events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused and clueless spectator; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the comments of the director. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some archive images of real and horrible acts of violence, including executions in times of war. Although it works in the context of the film, I think the ideas behind the film could have been presented without having to resort to such extreme content. This film is NOT absolutely for weak stomachs or for those who are easily offended, and in no case should be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climatic compared to the content of the rest of the film. If you are not listening to the comment as it happens, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was once, "sit down with the guy and let him talk, without cuts". commentary. While this is not necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes complaining about his college, shooting conditions, co-producers, the bad movie and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what is otherwise an essential tool to understand the film. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed many years ago in 16mm and Super8 films over a period of four years with an extremely low budget. Due to this, the quality of video and audio is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
