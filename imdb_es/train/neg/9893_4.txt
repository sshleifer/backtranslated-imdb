I just hope that no old classicist / historian would see "Cleopatra", or, if they did, take it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more ridiculously than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulated and correspond well with the story). More flagrant is Octavio, Cesar's heir, in the Senate before the assassination of César: at the ripe age of 19! <br /> <br /> Besides this, the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than one hint of James Bond when he says: "César, Julio César." Billy Zane is a ridiculously dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela does everything possible to be the seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not very beautiful), but it is incredible. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning to all historians: this movie is not true to life!
