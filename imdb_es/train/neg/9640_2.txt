I was always curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I found it on Ebay I disbursed the $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so weird! This movie is SO bad, so terribly written and with an irremediably low budget that the final credits, which show all the cut scenes in which they twisted their lines, are, literally, the highlights of the film. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for an obvious reason, his topless scene) who uses his powers with an experimental machine to attract objects of another dimension to this reality. When she throws in some kind of box as an object, the army casually throws it into the open back of a truck with a soldier to protect it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A child in a foam monster costume is shot, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch on his face and then escapes to a nearby city. But instead of deploying half of the county's armed forces to find and protect the public, those responsible only let Pettyjohn and Ray find it on their own, but it does not matter, this movie blows ALL of its credibility before that. date. This barely escapes being voted on by me alone because of unintentional laughter, someone needs to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
