Only children under 12 should be able to watch this movie. The rest of us should carry a book, an MP3 player or just take a good nap to support the experience of this event. This can be best summarized as an "inflated" television movie that is distributed in theaters. The children will want to see this movie, and they will like it and have fun with the movie.
