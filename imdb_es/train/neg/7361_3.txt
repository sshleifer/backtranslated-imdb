Mr. Perlman gives an outstanding performance (as usual). Unfortunately, you have to fight with a subscribed script and some nonsense pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode complete with singles and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could do better but he seems satisfied. Make a grimace and growl through your part. <br /> <br /> The lovely Erika is very decorative (even if she is fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" act at last. <br /> <br /> SFX mainly poor CGI and thefts of other movies. <br /> <br /> The shootouts are pitiful, worthy of Team A <br /> <br /> It's not even worth watching them for Perlman - EVITA
