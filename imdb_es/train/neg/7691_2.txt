The seduction of the students is found on the other side of the desk, saved by the ex-students of the Elizabeth Berkley campaign, and attracts the attention of the young and astute Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself, I can honestly say that no teacher except one who did something for me did hormonally when I was a student. That was a Mrs. Diaz who was a music teacher in high school. Even when I was a gay kid, I could see what she was doing with the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had that, in any way, could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley. <br /> <br /> Corey is the girl she has, and she's also used to having her own way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that it comes from wealthy parents reinforces that belief. He is rejecting chemistry, which is what Berkley teaches and to maintain his grade point average, she agrees to be a tutor, but does not believe anymore. <br /> <br /> Then, when you try a violation and you get a no for an answer it is detrimental to your ego. When Berkley leaves the channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops taking into account the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau simply do not believe here. Sevier's parents have the means to get a good publicity spin on this for their son. <br /> <br /> The seduction of the students, which is an inappropriate name of a title, if there ever was one, is garbage altogether. After the beating that Berkley gave to Showgirls, this television movie was not an upward movement in his career.
