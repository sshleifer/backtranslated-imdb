The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and I've seen it several times. And although I know that the sequels are not usually as good as the original ones, I certainly did not expect such a bomb. The romance was flat, the vision gags old, the spoken humor just was not. This may not have been the worst movie I've seen, but it's close.
