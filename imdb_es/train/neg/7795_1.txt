First of all, I'm not really a fan of the whole "meat-eating stuff in a disgusting way", but I'm a movie fan, so my neighbor next door said he had the worst movie of all . East. So we started to see it. First, it is recorded on a camcorder without a tripod. Second, the skinny white doctor's voice is bent by a big black man! Third, none of the dialogues makes sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, although unconvincing and full of bad makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor next door) need psychological help. It's fun for about 5 minutes, but it ages fast. He's so amateurish that it's like watching a yearbook of badly nicknamed high school videos ... with zombies. A note for everyone involved in this movie: I want the 20 minutes of my life that I spent watching this, before falling asleep, back.
