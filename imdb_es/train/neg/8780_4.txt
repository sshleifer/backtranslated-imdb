Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Soon after, he was approached by Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who states that he has been receiving messages from Jonathan's late wife, Anna, through various electronic devices. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this simply an indication of something on a cosmic scale or another larger world? It is good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story with which it has been maintained is complicated and absurd in some points; it's as if the film does not know how to answer any of the questions it poses, so it distracts the viewer with new and unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is quite good, convincingly considered as a widower in suspense trying desperately to communicate with his late wife. He has matured enough as an actor, and has left behind the friendly roles of geeks he played about 15 years before. It looks a bit steep, maybe with a few more wrinkles than one might expect, but it has not lost any of the cunning and touch it showed during its quarter century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not like Keaton turns around. In a mediocre performance, is that the script itself is unsatisfactory. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confused as it progresses, and each tortuous path ends in another tortuous path. All this is very good if the road leads to some kind of acceptable outcome, something that unites more or less everything and explains ... something. But not the white noise; He knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than before he had seen him for the first time. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to see this garbage, although it receives the support of Ian McNeice (like Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the love interest required.
