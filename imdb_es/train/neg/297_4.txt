For the record, this movie is intriguing but it is not original. In 1998, a movie starring Talia Shire called The Landlady had almost the same plot, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is that Amanda Lear has had a bad life, an abusive father, a doctor in heat, mental homes, Finally, she is released from her happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... whom she abuses and kills the poor man. (Now THAT was original) The doctor had financed a mansion before she killed him and buried the piglet in the backyard. After moving, she falls in love with a stallion named Richard, who is married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady, you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone who stands between her and Richard (including a roadie). <br /> <br /> Much of the idea comes from the previous movie, the same idiot fellow who pokes his nose, the same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, the same as blowing a bodypress. It had some original material, the thing about the beer bottle was brutal. The highlights of the movie were Amanda's beautiful breasts in the top-hot scene. Something of a scam but not a total loss of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
