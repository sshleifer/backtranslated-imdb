YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the hell they are eating ... OK , there may be a drinking game here ... no ... YAWN <br /> <br /> Courtesy shower scenes ... OK I have my interest for a couple of seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and uninspired murders ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The end ... friend! That psychopath is upset - why the rest of the movie can not be like in the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately, is that it? - My advice - go to the last five minutes and look at that and then add something good to the player - For me I'm going back to sleep.
