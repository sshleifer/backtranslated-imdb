I just registered to make this comment (which largely echoes some of those that are already here). The performance is worse than the unsatisfactory one, it is based on common stereotypes, it has some of the worst exhibitions of insipid female objectification (whole body and brain). and it has some of the strangest lines that man knows. <br /> <br /> that include, but are not limited to, "well, let's see what these guys can do". I should also mention that when they show the clashes involving innocent civilians, it ends. Feel bad for innocent people and start hating the characters. The character of Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotyped characters of black people who simply rubs people incorrectly. It may or may not be a good actor, but this movie does not allow that kind of character exploration. Do you want a movie that leaves the audience on the bad side? Oceans 11. This movie only makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can not make up for this chance of a movie. That Enzo that Griffin trashed perfectly sums up this movie. It just sucks.
