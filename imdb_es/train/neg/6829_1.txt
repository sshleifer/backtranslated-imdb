I have written at least half a dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little movie and none was published, so I must say that someone at imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a group of oil tankers can resuscitate a military tank that has been installed in the desert for more than a decade, and turn it into a combat machine again, is ridiculous. This is the performance and direction. Pass it on.
