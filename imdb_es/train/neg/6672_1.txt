I am 47 years old and have spent most of my life I can remember, a fan of terror and science fiction movies. Be silent, black and white, without a budget or with a large budget, there are very few who can not find something that I like. That said, I'll give credit to this movie for the good effects of gore and creatures, but that's it. This is a case of effects on history. The truth is that we live in a time when there is very little that has not been seen in a horror movie. For a movie of any kind to really entertain, it must have a good and original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie does not even have good performance, only good effects. So, unless you can only go over the gore, this happens.
