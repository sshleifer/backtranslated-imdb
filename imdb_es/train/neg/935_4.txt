The users who have rated this movie so simply can not have seen enough good movies to compare it. Have all been brainwashed? Rarely have I been so disappointed in a movie and part of that must be attributable to the ridiculous exaggeration surrounding this film. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, BU is just a chase movie. We collect it at the end of a chase and go directly to another. And other. And other. And other. Do you see an emerging pattern? There is virtually no time lost in the plot, the development of the character or the boring reality. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the other two Bourne movies, you're pretty lost. If you have, you just WANT to be lost, somewhere away from the cinema. <br /> <br /> The dispassionate style of Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well in United 93, which was an overload of desperate feelings to happen, but in Bourne and his endless problems only has the effect of keeping the audience from getting involved with character. He runs. He jumps. He hits He blows himself up. He clears the tall buildings. Bla bla bla. Above all, he survives. He survives as a man of plastic action who survives, which only makes the ridiculous acrobatics that he extracts with greater ease and lacks any kind of tension. So it moves away from a building? And that? He will survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's a girl in the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decoration. I have seen more depth of characters and quick dialogues in the episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is boring and formless and does not tell us anything we did not know in the first movie. It was turned into a killing machine. What a thing. Discover your true identity And that? It has no emotional resonance when it arrives. <br /> <br /> The end of the 'turn' is telegraphic and weak. Oh, honey, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! I already reduced my score to 4 while writing this comment! It would be better if it ends now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is none. It is a noisy and tedious series of striking editions, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is total bullshit. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
