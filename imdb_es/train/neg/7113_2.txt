THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 of 5 stars) This movie has some very interesting opening credits (an off-screen narrator warns that the sponsors of the film will be offered a free burial if they die of fear when watching this movie, a terrifying image of a skull that emerges from a placid pool and ubiquitous spooky music) but, unfortunately, the film is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new wife to his isolated mansion ... warning his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in his past. Well, in a short time he begins to see and hear mysterious things that nobody else can. Her husband assures her that everything is on her mind and ... well, you can probably see where this is going. You will have discovered what is happening long before our unfortunate heroine ... because she has probably seen the same plot in hundreds of other movies and television shows (and she has done better too). To add to the innumerable transgressions of the film, most of the cuts in this film (in numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to miss some key scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly to the window ... she's going to open it ... you know she's going to see something that's scary ... and then ... suddenly, the scene starts sobbing in her husband's arms . So, what did she see? I guess we'll never know.
