This is one of those movies that should have been much better than it turned out to be. I'm afraid to think what the edition approved by Blockbuster should look like, because the director's DVD cut was a bore of epic proportions. Naturally, you do not expect him to be "The Godfather", but one or two acting classes could have been useful. <br /> <br /> In addition, there were many cute guys in this movie, but they were unfortunately under-exploited. I like to see a group of beauties wriggle in their BVD as much as the next guy, but I even have the right to wait a little longer. However, it was not a total loss; At least we got a look at Drew Fuller's garbage (cover) and a truly annoying haircut. And there's Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than him in "Bring It On" (and acting too). There is always a positive side, children. You just have to look very hard for it. And from time to time, you have to use your pause button.
