KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I remember to have called BOMBA) was my introduction to the work of cult director Honda; Is not this necessarily better? It's just that I've learned to be more tolerant with such an intrinsically scarce rate! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually get two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly, silly-looking giant ape and a robot variation that looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he is shown fighting against a couple of other monsters, and befriends a trio of humans. Naturally, he falls in love with the blond heroine (and soda); In fact, the most intriguing is a fatal woman in collusion with the crazy and villain genius of the film. Called Dr. Who and sporting an anemic appearance and a cloak usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> Kidnap King Kong and hypnotize him to retrieve the Element X, which is embedded in the frozen waste of the North Pole; apparently, the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to guarantee its full cooperation, who even captures its three "companions")! The female agent has a change of heart, helps the heroes (one of which, typically, is an indescribable American) and is killed by Who. Kong finally escapes and arrives in Tokyo, where he has a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor flees from the chaos that follows him in his sub? that, at the request of Kong's dream girl, is summarily destroyed by the giant monkey.
