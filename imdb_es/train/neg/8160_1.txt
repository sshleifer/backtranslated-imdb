and not in a fun way to see. it's just bad. It's amazing that people have posted positive things about it here. History sucks, acting is bad, it's not scary, special effects are not special, oh no! The blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee - the mirror turned into water! The hair, clothes and makeup in the 50s scenes are not accurate, and they got a middle-aged man with a hairline pulled back to play the high school version of himself. This is like a later nightmare on the subject of Elm Street. I like to sit and watch a corny horror movie as much as any other person, but there are better bad ones to choose from.
