Usually, I love lesbian movies, even when they are not very good. I'm partial, I suppose! <br /> <br /> But this is only the worst. Yes, the landscape and buildings are beautiful, and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this film is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between being in a bad mood and being drugged / drugged / fainting with any drug or alcohol that is useful, and She inexplicably endures this abominable behavior throughout the entire film. At no time are we given an idea of ​​why this is so, not even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If at least there was some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? We do not). I do not even know!) Relationship between the two, there could have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie in a moment asks Ella "why do you love me?" She does not even recognize this. It is never really clear if this is more than a lesbian (misbehaving) on ​​a boring trip with a heterosexual woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they know in The trip, which might have been animated and informative, is flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, although I'm sure it was not intentional. Women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a medium-sized boot. However, when they camp, they have a huge tent, cribs, sleeping equipment and even a table, a chair and a typewriter. On top of that, when they get on a ferry, we see lots of luggage, probably from them, probably also in the trunk of the little Ford! <br /> <br /> And throughout the whole movie, we never see a gas station, or anywhere it looks like it really would have a place to buy gasoline. Most of them travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So, where did they get fuel? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian movies, good or bad, but there are many that are better than this, and very few that are worse. Leave this on the shelf.
