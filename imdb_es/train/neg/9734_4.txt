A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power to ... burn down! <br /> <br /> I was really ready for this movie, with the direction of the great Toby Hooper and the wildcard Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average movie of individuals with violent powers. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. However, the special effects are not bad and they help to bring the film to the end. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, it's not classic, but it's not the worst of its kind either. <br /> <br /> ** outside of ****
