Collusion Course is even worse than the typical movie of the week of the "evil male corporate corporate capitalist". This movie is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underestimated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives a performance consistent with the demands of his character. This movie is so bad that the character of Leno, a jester of sanctification, is less annoying than the character of Morita, a sanctifying fool.
