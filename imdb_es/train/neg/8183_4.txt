This is a pretty soft piece about the World War II codes that are broken, stolen, etc. The performance is about what I expected from this MGM cast of "B" actors. <br /> <br /> A great warning. Jean Rogers, who did a great job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two series of Flash Gordon, is horrible in this movie. Your character is extremely annoying. She never stops doing it with her overacting. We are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility, he would be allowed to enter and leave any office of his choice even if he does not have an official function. From that point of view, I regret having seen this movie. My perception of Mrs. Rogers has always changed. Talentwise, she is an extremely light weight. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is your usual personality, which means it's just right. <br /> <br />
