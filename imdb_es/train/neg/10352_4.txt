I recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a Disney television movie and ordered the DVD. The book was one of my favorites as a child and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Although some of the children's actors do not look like the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well chosen. with a nice Meg (though too pretty) in the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job to establish the relationships between the main characters and to set the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to fall apart and once the children leave the earth, everything collapses. Alfre Woodward looks too young and too regal like the eccentric Mrs. Whatsit (think instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan's face is such a deadpan mask that she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in the last years. For some reason, they turn her into Mrs. That looks like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz, when she should have looked like an evil wicked witch from the west. <br /> <br /> In the end, what disappoints most is the terrible special. Effects and direction of art. I understand that this is a television movie, but the CGI seemed like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. The incarnation of Mrs. Whatsits centaurs is a disaster, as is the Chewbacca costume for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety and elegant creature instead of the nasty Big Foot like the one shown here. I could go on and on, almost all artistic choices are a disaster, presumably because there was not a big enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> This really would have needed the sense of wonder that Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting the literary fantasy series for children, nobody has thought about adapting A Wrinkle in Time and its sequels to the big screen, giving it the reach it deserves.
