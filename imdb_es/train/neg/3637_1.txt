I am surprised by the positive reviews of this uninspiring film. <br /> <br /> Often, with foreign films, I get criticized for complaining about the slow pace and the apparent "lack of action", as many of the best international films do not. Be up to the Hollywood storytelling model of West Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the frequent ingenuity and the lack of clich√© in the field of foreign cinema. I enjoy that many foreign films do not tie things in a nice and nice little tie. <br /> <br /> That said, this particular movie offered no redemption value for the time I lost watching it. There is no significant development of characters, there is no attractive story arc, there is no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A group of prejudiced emotionally immature and mistreated colonial abusers mistreat their slaves, and a small girl is hurt by her only friend when the "boy of the house" finally tires and teases him . . <br /> <br /> While the previous paragraph is moving and dramatic, this movie will bore you while you play the stage. I was so uncommitted that it took me three sessions to finish it, and I would not even have done it if it had not been for the positive grades. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period, I suggest you avoid this one.
