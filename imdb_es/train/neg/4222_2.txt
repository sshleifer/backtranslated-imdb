For those of us who live during those weeks of filming in the city and around the Valley, do not forget the tedious days of road closures and the "cinema". As a reminder to those who live here, the locals include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was the BC fire station; the chase scenes included Moon Drive on Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above all of us, even back then. In regards to the movie, a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding the acting and the plot, but who cares at this level. A good time capsule for those who enjoy our coastal and valley landscape. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the movie), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw: the Old Erba parking lot was the town square, the backyard footage of Grove Street in Boulder Creek; Turn off the thought cap and see some actors in their early days.
