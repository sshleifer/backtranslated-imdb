We saw this on the shelf of the local video store, we saw "Coppola" in the credits and we got excited. That was the only time this movie aroused any interest. I could never understand if it was an attempt at a humorous film that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly amateurish. The sound in particular was absolutely terrible, especially in the scenes taken at the little bar; The dialogue was so cheesy in some parts that it was amazing. Very disappointing.
