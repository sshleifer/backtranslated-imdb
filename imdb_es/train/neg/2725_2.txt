Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a "border policeman" of the United States and Mexico. He serves as the father figure of young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man in his impending wedding. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) can be tougher. Duro is what you need to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Su√°rez). Partnerships may be changing. <br /> <br /> If you find the possibility of listening to "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" saying that the expletives are repulsive, you should stay away from "The Border". If not, you may not have a stomach for the "realistic" culling scene. Although not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
