Belmondo is a tough cop. Chase a great drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a great villain, see "The Sharky Machine", but here he is clearly nicknamed, and therefore lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the most embarrassing places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, hits some people, gets names, goes to more shameful places, asks for more names, hits more people, etc. The whole movie is blow after blow. after punch It seems that the people who did it had no more ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 years old here, performs some good acrobatics at the beginning; Apart from those, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, trite, superficial and forgettable police film. (* 1/2)
