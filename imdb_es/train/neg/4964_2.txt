This movie is a farce! The names are rudely mispronounced and the plot is twisted and twisted into something that no literary enthusiast can recognize. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous crossbow weapon. Beowulf does not need a weapon like that! In the poem, he tears off Grendel's arm with his own hands! And I can not believe that the writers have done such a thing. However, the way in which Grendel is portrayed is impressive. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go crazy if she saw this abomination. Unless you're a fan of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid this movie at all costs. And even then, I would not recommend it.
