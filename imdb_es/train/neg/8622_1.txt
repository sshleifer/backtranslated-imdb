Since the appearance of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, there has been much talk about the recovery of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not Believe It The people who now make movies in HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of the drawing, here, but he spends most of the movie with just an idiot smile and throwing a coin. He flips the coin over and over and over and over again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman chasing the handsome boy who throws coins. But once again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress in the female head who runs some kind of company and has to pay a ransom or something, but mostly it seems that I would rather be in a spa or mall than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
