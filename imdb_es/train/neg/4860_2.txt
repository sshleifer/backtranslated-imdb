Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program surpasses me. It really sucks! Of course, I'm talking about the stations after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if he were talking exclusively about those seasons, this show would have obtained eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appear after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast is good. They were, and they are, horrible. The comedy is not funny at all. ABSOLUTELY!!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was full of very talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever it's called), all of whom should have got better deals after they left MAD TV. This program is highly overrated and less worthy of its channel browsing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible program. Leave on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV wither and die, as it deserves.
