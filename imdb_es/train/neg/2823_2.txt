Well, TiVo recorded this thanks to Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of overexpression, even from Angelina. She is about 20 years old and is playing a 16 year old girl. There are three characters who are supposed to be Italians. Everyone else is Italian, American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young male protagonist is cute, says my wife. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was chosen as a Dr. Randy, that was a bad sign. The two couples who persecute their children are like the four Italian crackpots. <br /> <br /> My wife did not release the remote control. Hopefully she was not taking makeup, clothes or decorating tips. It was a sickly, twisted combination of horrible and shrill. It was delicate. <br /> <br /> Cutting my left ventricle was not enough to distract me from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and put your head on the TV screen. You'll be glad you did it. The only movie I've seen that was worse than this was "Hamburger: The Movie." Or maybe "mortal friend".
