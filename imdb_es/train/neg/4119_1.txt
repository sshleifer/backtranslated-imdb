I thank God for not having gone to the movies for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe what I saw. I wonder if any movie could be worse than this one. They spent millions of dollars on this movie for nothing. Horrible performance and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man who works in that film company;) It's a big fiasco! In the year 2000 can you still laugh at this kind of movie? embarrassing
