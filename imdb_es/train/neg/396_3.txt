I saw this when I was in the theater, it started so strong that in 1980 it was a daring movie and the special effects were excellent AT THE MOMENT. Now it would have had to have spent at least 30 years approximately in 1980 to really understand this point because the study of the film historically loses the mentality established at the time of expectations and other related psychological factors. Now, as I said, the film was entertaining and very entertaining. It accumulates to an excellent climax then. It ends, I mean the person who described it as having a water balloon in his hand before launching it, as well as being a very poetic description. In my experience, I simply was not strong enough. My wife and I were fine ... how can I say this? We were upset, I mean we paid money, we invested the time to see the movie that was excellent. "We both felt that we were robbed with an end that convinced the production company so much that we ran out of money and could not raise enough to finish it properly." In fact, my wife said it better, she did not finish, ONLY SHOULD STOP!
