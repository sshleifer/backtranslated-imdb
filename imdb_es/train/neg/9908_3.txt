I gave this 3 stars a maximum of 10, since the stories are open and left unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely unpleasant way, plus the scenes of a decomposing corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above had to be displayed in such a graphic way. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, refers to three loosely interconnected stories, none of which concludes satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects the three cartoons. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, who looks very good, like a wanted criminal who is fleeing to Mexico to escape the law and the bounty hunter, when he crosses a border city and sees a parlor girl of sad face played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of the Hemingway girls. , I'm not sure which, to play a western wife on the lonely border who goes to see a neighbor, an attractive redhead, who soon we realize that she has been too long in the badlands. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the movie that is completely beyond rational understanding.
