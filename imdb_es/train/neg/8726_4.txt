First of all I want to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars that I qualified. I gave her four stars because for me, this 86-minute movie always seems like 2 hours and a half and is not attractive enough to see everything. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title in which my DVD calls it) is better than the average nature movie counterattacks. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungle of Southeast Asia has just opened and employs the natives Trying to manipulate the wildlife that surrounds it. Mother nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant crocodile. But the creature is not the only thing that the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the staff of the resort) have to worry about, the natives also rub themselves incorrectly. <br /> <br /> This movie is an adventure story / horror quite well done with a good score and musical direction. But the crocodile itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously false. Some of the close-ups of their jaws are good, but that should be all we need to see. Some of the distant shots underwater make it painfully obvious that what we're really dealing with is an alligator toy that you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are credible, if they are not authentic. <br /> <br /> It's probably not the movie that will give you non-stop emotions, if any, but they were shot and produced well enough to give them a good mention. And like many creature films, it ends with an extremely high body count. It also has a lot of good jungle scenery. However, acting is below average, but who expected it to be better, huh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than its recent US counterpart "Primeival", but nothing to compare with "Jaws". But remember that it may not be attractive at some points.
