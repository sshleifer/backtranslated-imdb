I do not even know where to start with this. "It's about the family." That must be the worst line of dialogue that has been heard in a "horror" movie, although this could not be a horror movie, even if it tried! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. You must stop playing the type of token that dies in each action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore." He has some talent. In addition, Lily Taylor should stick to independent films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no place in the legitimate performance for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
