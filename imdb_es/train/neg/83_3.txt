Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive and pleasant woman, dominated by an intelligent teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a small husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of whom were tediously self-centered and obnoxious. <br /> <br /> This was advertised as a troubled family harassed by a crazed killer during a relentless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not happen until about the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it's nothing to send anyone to the storm's hold. <br /> <br /> Stalking also does not become intense until near the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spent listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, argued until I just wanted to slap the daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she's committed to Zack, a questionable guy, and they're constantly kissing each other; in fact, Jill returns home and finds them in Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband, Sean, complaining about her or criticizing her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive, since his face is so covered in freckles that you could play connecting the dots. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the notification to Jill of an outstanding bill on her credit card for a hotel she has never been in, and that she thought Sean had never been in either. <br /> <br /> Jill leaves. to the hotel where he meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice man, elderly and divorced, who sympathizes with her. In fact, when she sees her husband there again, she phones Jill and drives her away. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel and sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, she leaves without Sean seeing her and doing absolutely nothing. In fact, she does not even say anything to Sean when he gets home. This did not make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill has given Richard his business card, so he calls her and it seems that she is in real estate. She shows him a condo. Then, they drink a drink and things get comfortable between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill are putting it, hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to retire. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about their trap. Sean complains about how Jill has let him down since his father died. Apparently, his lack of morals is her fault. Finally, Jill confesses to Sean his own lack of morals and almost adultery, and of course that is also his fault, as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The small family decides to go camping. -which means more whining and complaining among them, especially of the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was encouraging the stalker for everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
