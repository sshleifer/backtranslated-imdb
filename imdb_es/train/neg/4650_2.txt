With a cast of British actors and a nice picture of Britain in the 1950s, I expected and hoped the movie would entertain me more. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck to him for the wrong reasons; I could not believe how horrible it was. I must have seen thousands of old movies and I am always willing to make concessions for being products of their time, but this was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, a major problem is that it does not. It seems he does not know what he wants to be: a soft romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a little stunned when Jeannie Carson suddenly started singing in about 15 minutes! It is not credible at any level, neither the story itself nor the fact that Daisy never seems to have an ounce of threat at any time. Other aspects that challenged credibility included the cast of suave Donald Sinden as a composer (a songwriter for God's sake!), The fact that he has Diana Dors as a fianc√©e and does not seem to have the slightest interest in her (ie, Diana). Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in the office of a song editor. Everything is silly in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be at the beginning with that wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson. After that, everything went downhill on a big road.
