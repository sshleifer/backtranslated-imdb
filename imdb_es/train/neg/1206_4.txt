This long lost thought, sometimes, is available on the web. So I bought a copy. Well, of course, the acting is terrible and the line of the story is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who searched for this also know their background story. It was made by a grindhouse movie owner for an extremely low budget. But for me it surely did not spoil the money in accessories but in the makeup. Makeup is for that kind of well made film. The zombies are visible and the blood is intact. The only problem with this type of movie is the quality of the film. It's terrible, fortunately there are no whistles in the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see the gore. In a fun way they tried to sell this as not really for the squeamish. A voice-over tells him at the beginning of the film to be careful with a sign and a man who appears with green flashes, who tells him there is blood on the road. Of course that does not work, it made me think of Cannibal Girls, I had that annoying bell when the red things started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go for the story, go for the zombies and observe a continuity error. When the girl and the boy make love first, she takes off her bra, then they make love and suddenly she puts on her underwear again ... try to do that, or I'm disconnecting a bit, ... eat it, ugly corpses
