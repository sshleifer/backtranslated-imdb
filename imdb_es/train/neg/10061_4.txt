'The Curse of Frankenstein' sticks faithfully to the story of Mary Shelley for a word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were good at all. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed Frankenstein's family has been completely eliminated and replaced by ... nothing. The heart and the moral center of the story are gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a deceitful and tortuous murderer; He deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a superficial checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even if it is taken on its own terms, this is garbage: a soft and rambling movie that features a trite-looking creature with a haircut in a pudding bowl. As it is the first film of terror of Hammer, directed by Terence Fisher and carried out by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in the history of the horror is sure. But it's crap.
