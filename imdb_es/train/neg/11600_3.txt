After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural movement. However, they should have stopped him before he started. Alice, who survived Part 4, is pregnant and it seems that Freddy is using his unborn child to reach his victims, who of course are Alice's friends. Strange nightmare film, very loaded with religious images and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
