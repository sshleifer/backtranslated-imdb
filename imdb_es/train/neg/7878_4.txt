I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is just bad. First, he had trouble deciding whether it was a boy or an adult, which caused a strange mix of an adult story and some rather violent scenes with a silly duckling that at first gives "funny" moments. <br /> <br /> But that's not important, the movie is just boring, immobile and is not true to the original story. It simply does not transfer to the image all the points that Orwell tried to make in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Have not they learned something? Who will be the next Napoleon then? Benjamin?!!
