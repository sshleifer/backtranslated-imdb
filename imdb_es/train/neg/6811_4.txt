When I saw this movie for the first time in the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think that directing and cinematography are excellent, as is music. But it is really the script that over time began to bother me more and more. I find the writing of Emma Thompson self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a secondary character, a second violin for her Elinor, too old and too severe; She is given many kinds of "focus moments" in the movie, and often seems to be there only to show off to Thompson herself. <br /> <br /> I understand that she has cut several characters from the book, but omit the only scene in which Willoughby is redeemed in the book? For someone who blushed and loved the book long before the movie, those are always difficult things to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. He is not given the best script in the world to work, but he still does it with grace, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but he plays the role perfectly. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she's absolutely fantastic as always.
