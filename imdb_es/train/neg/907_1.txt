I wrote a review of this movie below after buying it on DVD and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to see it again after reading some of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar budget films (that is, without a budget, filmed on a digital camera), I keep my original comments. This is a project for students without a budget (and it's not particularly good), released on video / dvd to look like an award-winning film (if you read the cover). So trick the audience into thinking that it is something that it is not. I want to recover my money according to the law of operations description! Complete the garbage!
