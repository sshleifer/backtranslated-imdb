There are not many good things to say about Underneath, Soderbergh's false effort towards the neo-noir. Soderbergh faithfully remakes the noir Criss-Cross by Robert Siodmak, without greatly altering the plot, however, the adaptation takes away every ounce of its avant-garde noir cinema atmosphere, giving it the same story set in the same less attractive places, styles of life and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later make wonderful movies about crimes such as the Out of sight and Ocean series with great style and ambience, takes the dangerously obvious path towards modernization by renovating history with the ugliest, most boring and flattest fashion of the decade. the nineties. The nightclubs have terrible garage bands and disgusting clothing, the uninteresting version of Peter Gallagher of the anti-hero of Burt Lancaster is left by his girlfriend femme fatale for the compulsive purchase of modern lifeless appliances such as stereos, televisions and other modern equipment that stinks the reaction. out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been more entertaining and less boring to have had some thanks as a good score, more carnal for your characters, more than just William Fichtner, who offers performances that are not 'T of wood, a rhythm sharper. Unfortunately, Bottom does not have any of these things. Soderbergh, a good director, does not use this dry separation for the benefit of his film this time. That arrangement works wonders when he's directing a crime movie with more tongue on the cheek like the George Clooney images mentioned above, or a social drama or characters like Traffic or sex, mint and video. With a film like Under, intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer.
