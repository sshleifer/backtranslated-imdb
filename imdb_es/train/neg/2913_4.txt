Of course, it is very nice to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, however, I would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting with the script, which I think was not a wise script as some may think. especially the cheesy dialogues, which placed the audience in a position that, as if not intelligent enough to understand situations, which, in most cases, makes the film unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; You can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. The weakest part of the scenario is that it is impossible for patients with serious mental illness to behave like normal people, as professionals immediately. Have you ever looked for the possibility that patients who undergo heavy medical exams will act as professionals and use all medical terms that even normal people can not use ????? !!!!!! also in the scene where the staff was looking for the most dangerous patient, without any weapon to protect themselves, was another strange point of the film. And that scene was so suitable for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! Those are not the only weak parts of the movie. There were also many beautiful things in the movie. The most dangerous patient's description was an exact copy of Hannibal, also the appearance of Togan in the end is obviously the worst mistake he could have made in his first film! the uproar over the greatness of the film and the interviews the actor gave only made people curious and forced them to see it. Gen is a total disappointment. I would have asked, if Sahan were not so famous, could Togan film this movie, with this amount of budget? I hope that Togan realizes that it is not fashionable to play a role as a director, as he said in an interview. It was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! He must be aware of the fact that he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan! Hoping you will be more careful and creative next time in this great industry!
