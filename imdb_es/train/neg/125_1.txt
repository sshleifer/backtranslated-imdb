I hope to avoid doing this type of movies in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment, but it does not tell a compelling story. <br /> <br /> One can feel virtuous by sitting through it because it touches many IMPORTANT subjects, but it does so without any discernible motive. The viewer is left with no new perspectives (unless one comes up while the mind wanders, as will invariably occur during this meaningless movie). <br /> <br /> One could spend time looking out the window. A tree that grows <br /> <br />
