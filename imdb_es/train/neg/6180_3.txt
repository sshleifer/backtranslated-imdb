Last night I attended one of the premieres and I have the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. The fact that you have directed a lot of music videos does NOT qualify you to make movies. The film had an overabundance of prolonged shots that made no sense, horrible angles and terrible lighting. The editing did not help this mess at all. When "Dixie" is late for the memorial service, her mother comments on her hand, but it is never clear what the hell she is talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promising, but the script was thin and full of holes the size of a Ford truck. We never understand what drives the characters, what is behind the conflicts they have with each other or how they resolve them exactly. Sixteen years away are eliminated in 4 days, apparently by magic. The deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés. (In fact, the whole city was a great cliché of southern life). Half of the audience complained when Toby said "You already have my blood running through your veins, gurl" ... and we were treated that insipid line not once, but TWICE! The revelations induced yawning and the dramatic confessions boiled down to "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The performance was good considering the shock of a script with which they had to work. Toby was dark and meditating on most of the movie, but when he smiled and lit up he was charming. It's a pity that I did not have more screen time like that. Kelly Preston's performance chops are quite rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun has talent and it's certainly not her fault that the writers have made her character so unpleasant at first that you do not blame her father for not coming for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie, but they seemed more or less lost. (And, in fact, his characters get lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a Toby fan, you'll love the songs. But often the film felt like a forced scene just so they could present one of their songs, or the artists on their record label. For example, the official love song of the movie is "Crash Here Tonight." You would think he would play in a tender love scene, but no ... we listen for about 45 seconds while he goes to a memorial service. It was as if they said "well, we have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is disturbing and the best that comes out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In short ... a promising plot never fully unfolds and the film is horribly uneven as it tries to be a vehicle for the placement of music and the product of Toby Keith for Ford Trucks. It goes from being people who are rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music, but the story is told so badly that both points are lost in this great music video. I like Toby and he really wanted me to like the "Broken Bridges", but the people he told to make this movie disappointed him and he deserved one of his famous boots, you know where.
