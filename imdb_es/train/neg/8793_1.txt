For those who decide if they want to see this movie or not and are reading these comments for information, first I offer these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was filmed reluctantly, it was slapped quickly and it seems that it was conceived in its entirety by someone from the line of a Burger King of Hong Kong. I can not remember seeing a movie with a variety of one-dimensional characters trying to make their way through such a mundane script! It is an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man enters his flooded apartment and offers the surprising revelation that "tears can be dried with a handkerchief, but the water takes time to cleanse"). The same character is also seen maintaining a deep and meaningful relationship with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty clothes, etc. The trembling and errant camera work was another annoying characteristic that I could have done without him. And if that is not enough to make you vomit in your popcorn, we hear the old ode of the 60 "California Dreaming" of Mamas and Papas sounding the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to the United States through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I can not, for my life, find out why a man with his talent would be upset. It is known that he commented: "I am happy to love a movie so much". However, many of us expect you to focus on making your audiences happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
