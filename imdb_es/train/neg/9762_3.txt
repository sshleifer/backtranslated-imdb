Alan Alda plays real-life writer "Sports Illustrated" George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. More pale, an incomparable drama curiously tempered with fantasy. The director Alex March adopts an interesting aspect about this material, he records it in an almost documentary way (with macho comments) and, nevertheless, he gives the story a capricious whimsical touch; even so, by highlighting the cinematic brightness in this configuration, it turns the main narrative into a jumble. Alda's smug and uncharismatic performance is another disadvantage, although the supporting cast is full of professional real-life athletes (and the dazzling Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend, how is that for a fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
