This movie is a horrible and forgettable vehicle by Sean Connery. The performances are generally bad, especially by Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris, generally solid. Connery looks like a disaster like a Harvard academic. The movie gets worse as it goes on. It is a third-class mystery that becomes extremely artificial when it unravels. The movie wasted an excellent cast. George Plimpton also appears in a minor role to add some seriousness to Connery while debating the death penalty. Violence and the atmosphere are a mystery / thriller of third category that is manipulated to the maximum. The scripts and the address are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the only virtue of the film. Manipulator, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
