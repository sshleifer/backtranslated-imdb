** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A guy with a silly looking Kong costume (the same one that was used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) offers much of the laffs in this very mocking movie of monsters. Kong has been resurrected on Mondo Island and this time helps the lunkhead hero and other good ones. The vampire-like villain is called Dr. Who? Funny, he does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally duplicates it with the pride and joy of Who, a giant ape robot that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's films, this may have had some merit before American audiences tried and added new images. The animation company Rankin / Bass had a hand in this mess. They should have joined top child programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
