I feel much less generous with this movie than others of its kind. The representation of the insane in this century is always done with them so extravagant as to be a different species. Their antics are so scandalous as to be totally fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or have a fascination for chickens. They are in the making or hitting each other. It is as if the scriptwriter said: what can I do to do it, without having an idea of ​​what is madness or even mental illness? Look at the wonderful human representation in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where diseases are credible and real. Once I worked in a state mental hospital. I did not see any of these guys. They are too intelligent and calculating to come alive.
