As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find that this series is a gross representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very handsome and he looks much older than what is described in the book. I discovered that they have already made the wonderful and colorful characters seem very vulgar. One of the things that I loved about books is that, despite all the crap that is going on, Sookie is always a lady and yet, in the television series it does not seem to be that way. Not only that, but the prejudices shown in the television series are not so widespread in the books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected the feeling that they would be used for the series.
