I thought the movie was a poor documentary. No substance was discussed. It seemed to cheapen ideas and did not bring anything new. The film lacked awe or romance or something that really led to science. Most scientists seemed "stereotyped" and, at times, strange. One woman said that her prizes did not matter much, only the children who received help. She said after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her prizes. Playing "humble scientist", are we? "I have equations dancing in my head," said another. I do not see how that explains anything to us. It has not covered the significant effects of science in our culture. The politics of science was hardly touched. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad movie for children from 10 to 14 years old. Apart from that, I felt it was boring and not very revealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
