In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. Next, I'll elaborate and tell you why, in my humble opinion, it ruins this movie. <br /> <br /> Gere and the Danes are doing their job, and while it's not their best job, it's pretty good. The rest of the cast, however, is doing a really poor job. Of course, this is not entirely the fault of the actor. The problem is that Gere and the Danes are the only ones who have characters that have the slightest space in the film to give depth. All the other characters have too little space in the film to create depth, or the character is such a clich√© that it does not matter how hard the actors work. <br /> <br /> The director has a little bit of skill. It's complex, but just looking at the address, I think it does a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all it is a bad movie script. The characters are superficial (except those of Gere and Danes), the villains are cliches and the actions of the characters are totally incredible. In addition to this, writers must have an agenda in which they want to recover our points of view and our ethics one hundred years. It's the kind of movie that says that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they paid the price society gave them. It is also the kind of film that says, although only between the lines, that all forms of sexual deviation must be punished without trial, judge or jury. And, of course, according to the movie, all that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So, if you're going to film school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you're writing scripts yourself and you want an ego boost. Look at it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
