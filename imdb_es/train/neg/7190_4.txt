The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE involves college students playing a cruel phone game that unexpectedly (for them, if not horror fans) puts them over their heads. The 7EVENTY 5IVE HISTORY, on the other hand, is that of a horror movie that had a bit of promise, sadly surpassed by a very bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun, if The silly, old-fashioned story has been derailed from the beginning by the wrong belief of its filmmakers that the audience would enjoy watching a group of noisy children and rich complaining to each other during most of the movie's execution time. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer, (in a minor role that is primarily designed to add the only star power of the film) each character on the screen is a different race of young A-hole. <br /> <br /> Men and women, black and white, heterosexual and homosexual, a complete set of shallow and strident college students carries most of the narrative of the film. Worse yet, since the story is about a PARTY game that went wrong, most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b ***** ds. Because of this, there are few breaks for the viewer, which must endure the angry sniper of the thin protagonists. Although at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all the characters interact in a very hostile way, long before a genuine conflict has actually arisen. This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher movie: the audience, which had the intention of worrying about potential customers, instead not only encourages the anonymous killer, but wants it to have come to start eliminating the empty brats long before. <Br /> <br /> The real shame of this poor characterization is that, otherwise, 7EVENTY 5IVE really has some potential. Visually it's fine. First-time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to create a suspenseful environment. They also manage to deliver some competent moments, although scarce, of classic 80s-style blood. Surprisingly, the distribution of the production is also quite capable. It is not that the actors are not capable of expressing realistic human emotions; it is simply that the script (co-written by the newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who was much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) is short of those moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE is difficult to recommend, as its family premise and few emotions can not overcome the bad taste left by a story driven by a herd of unpleasant characters. In this warm mourning, the real mystery is why someone should care about a group of young people that you can not even like.
