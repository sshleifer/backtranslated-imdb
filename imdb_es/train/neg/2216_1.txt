I'm a lover of B films, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in heaven. These movies are good to stop you from thinking about everything that happens in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I'll still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so horrible that I had to register in IMDb to be able to warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark man, which the movie barely touched. In order to keep viewers interested, they made sure there was blood every few minutes. During an attack scene, the camera moved out of the attack, but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood thrown by a member of the stage to warn you that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects) . Back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were kept naked and that the test equipment required that they be monitored through the breast tissue. Anyway, this film had a poor development of the plot, a terrible story, and I regret to say that it acted very badly. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this situation.
