I never thought that a movie could be so atrocious, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible performance, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was horrible and, as for the stupid killing / sex scene, all in one, it was a bad decision. It was really shocking and that's not a compliment! How can someone make this movie, see it again and say "Yes, that's a good movie. If you have not seen it, I beg you do not do it :-(
