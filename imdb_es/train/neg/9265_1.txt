After having listened to and enjoyed the comment of Harvey Bernhard Omen II, I was surprised to discover that he was also behind this absolute rubbish. It's like a really bad TV movie that you can see in the middle of the day when you have the flu and you're too sick to reach the remote control. I think that the moment Michael Lerner confronts what I can only describe as the cast of Les Miserables in high school, my mouth opened in disbelief. And then my mouth went up and down because I was laughing a lot. Terrible. I do not know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I have made my point succinctly, there is nothing smart in all this modern wordiness.
