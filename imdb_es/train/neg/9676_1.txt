The movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has done it twice, so it actually took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. Women spoke firmly and men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to find out why Emmenthal's men were sexually involved with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a difficult choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? Or two? <br /> <br /> The movies have slept me before, but no movie has done it twice, so it actually took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad.
