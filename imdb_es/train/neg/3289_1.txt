I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be good to ruin one of the best shows on television. Do we really need a big screen again? Did you ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a new version of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, they took out all the music and turned it into a drama. Do you think they would like that? This movie does not have the same feeling as the original. Of course the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always good, got into trouble because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main goal was to help people who passed through the city. None of that mattered to the people who made this movie, they may have never seen the original program completely. My big question is, what will they ruin later?
