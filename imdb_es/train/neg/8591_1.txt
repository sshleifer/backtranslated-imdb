I'm trying to decide if jumping on a wooden chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. It ends the destruction of what was once a pair of classic movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas's career. Do you want us to take the Annakin is a nonsense of Vader? I never believed it to be true. This movie claims those feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and each new movie was piled up until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new rocks are to throw. Do you want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are not related. Vader is NOT his father. Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good for anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke during the first two movies. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and he lied to his mother about putting him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. All this mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be attributed to that stupidity of Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had had a brain, he would not have come a year from Annie, but he had told her to do what George Lucas wrote for her. What a fool!
