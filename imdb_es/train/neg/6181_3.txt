If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and did not even know about The existence of this film until the day before its release, when the advertising company panicked and covered Music Row with dozens of flyers and billboards. Anyway, it hardly lasted two weeks in theaters. <br /> <br /> The bad performance, the bad writing and the bad production only begin to describe this shame of a movie. For starters, the names are a bit too big: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh <br /> <br /> The awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the signal cards out of the camera. Angel's character quickly transforms from his more polished city ways to a cowgirl, and slips into southern lingo after two days at the ranch. His wardrobe goes from the chic version to a feminine version of Toby; in fact, in the final scene, their costumes are identical, so one wonders if the wardrobe attendant is sick. <br /> <br /> The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most notable example is when Toby decides to go swimming and his voice suddenly sounds like he's screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on the screen. Overexploitation, exasperation, grimaces and bad humor better describe the interpretation and direction of the terrible script by the actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic drinks and in the company of your most ingenious friends. But that does not say much.
