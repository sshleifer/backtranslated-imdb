Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an elderly player, wins the young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (beautiful, but has no talent, Brooke Shields) in a game of poker. Together, the unlikely couple (of course) embarks on a quest for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> That's the story and there really is no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It just is not there. The performance is also very weak, which was a big surprise, given that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful landscape. and some good looks from a young Brooke Shields. However, his character is so irritating (especially at the beginning) and silly, that he never looks so sexy or attractive. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt that more of this can be done. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this movie. He must have even convinced his father (Henry Fonda) in a cameo (useless) in this ridiculous disaster. Unfortunately, this was their only movie together. Could not Henry be in EASY RIDER, for example? 3/10
