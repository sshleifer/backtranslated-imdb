Yuk. I found it odd that your old book on curses was made using a common writing source instead of being written by hand. The acting is so apathetic at times and so dramatic at other times. Why would a "demon" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the fun of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle when she is somewhere? We understand! You spent a little money to rent a third-class crotch rocket. It does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith" lair looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed for no apparent reason. Everyone is a disposable character. The forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived films I've seen coming out of the SciFi channel. Stay away unless you're in bad movies.
