I have not seen anything so bad since I left the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through all of this alone by Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing I could do to save this beast. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film failed miserably in all aspects of film making. The characters were cardboard and could not evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was totally incredible. The performance was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what is the point? <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a problem, but most likely she will now regret it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or your time in this trap. There is nothing worth seeing here.
