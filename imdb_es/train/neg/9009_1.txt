What a terrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of dirty, dirty, miserable and misanthropes living inside. These people who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects do not seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: an extra nasty scientist whose main acting ability is "leering" and "the sinister look" has cloned a Dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on these kinds of things, the other scientists were surprised, because apparently they were very behind in their experiments and were caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted and killed while trying to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most CGI cheap special effects. It hardly looks better than a caricature, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting detail in the body of the Dragon. All it looks like is a gray spot. The acting is less than horrible. These scientists act as a group of children who can not agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the unknown actors in the world. this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast. This movie is really, very atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is silent. The CGI is very very cheap and amateur. There is nothing commendable in this movie, it is not even good to take a look when it comes to doing homework or other work.
