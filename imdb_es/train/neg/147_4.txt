"Valentine" is another horror movie that is added to the list of stalking and bar films (think of "Halloween", "Friday the 13th," "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). Certainly, it's not as good as the movies I mentioned, but it's better than most of the scams that occurred after the first movie "Friday the 13th." One of those films was the 1981 Canadian movie "My Bloody Valentine," which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than that, but it does not say much. The plot: a young nerd is mocked and joked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then, the film moves years later, when all the classmates have grown up, and then they are eliminated one by one. The murderer is supposed to be the young man who now grew up seeking revenge. But is it him? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a mediocre script does not do them justice. However, there are some moments of fear in everything. <br /> <br /> ** (of four)
