Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this film, Howard offers us a Whoville full of greedy, manipulative and egocentric. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the script is the most unpleasant person you can imagine, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is a magic movie. Like Danny Devito's penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so disgusting that any comedy that can be drawn from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon showed a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car, muttering to himself or cheating small children in the supermarket with his cane This Grinch is totally devoid of any degree of humanity, humor or perception, and his redemption at the end of the film sounds false. The whole movie sounds fake: there's a stupid Christmas illumination contest, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why the Grinch is so stupid to dig in his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery of why some of the Whos have that strange spread of lips and other of them no. Contrary to the caricature of 1966, I imagine that children will find this film boring, irritating and full of contradictory messages. Do we really need to see Slutty Smurf, also known as Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Add the necessary butt jokes, jokes about farts, jokes about sex and other obligatory jokes of humor, and have a movie that is so far from the 1966 cartoon (or the book that inspired it) as that of George W. Bush. Rational thinking, lucid. Thumb down on this great fat turkey.
