<br /> <br /> It must be taken into account if an accusation was intended. If in the year 2000 there were still divergences of feelings between Caucasians and African-Americans in Georgia, as shown in this film, obviously there is still a somewhat backward mentality among many people. It is rather hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone loves Halle Berry, Whoopie Goldberg, Beyonc√©, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, et. to the. while in the back there are manifest racial divisions. <br /> <br /> The white grandmother is suddenly pushed by her black granddaughter, only to meet a black grandfather in a very white social backwater. The story is sweet, it does not lack tragic connotations and is eminently predictable as in most of this type of television films, although the final scene has it guessing ... will it? Will not it be him .......? <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere interpretation, and Louis Gossett is a good match for her; Little Penny Bae, fortunately, does not steal the program. <br /> <br /> A nice way to relax after Sunday lunch without having to strain your mind too much, although you may have a little nap in the middle of that
