I am a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I will go to any movie to see it, which led me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many other people who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. Because the whole movie seems to have been shot with a handheld camera, significant parts of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and what there is does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people who stop to smoke cigarettes or sit in a room looking at each other without talking. The way the movie's time changes is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even having read several reviews in advance and having a general idea of ​​what the film was about, I still had trouble understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film was not remotely similar to the previous films starring Ziyi Zhang, but I expected to see it in something different, but unfortunately, in the end I was disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, although most of the time she has nothing to smile about. I could have dispensed with the sex scenes, as they were almost sexless and without any obvious feeling among the participants as you might expect to find.
