Basically, the Hunter sisters, Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome to participate in a summer internship program, but not long after they start their work they are immediately fired for a series of setbacks. But the man who owns the company they are working on, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their work, and they, little by little, become useful assets and talented (fashionable) artists, and help to prevent a bad man from taking over. the company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. It can be said that this movie was made to go directly to the video, the work of the camera is totally different and does not help when you want to admire the views of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to see, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities, I knew that before they were not going to interest me in any way (they are not even so pretty), this is horrible movie gush of garbage. Pretty poor
