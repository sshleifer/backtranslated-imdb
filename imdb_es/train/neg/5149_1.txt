This film is about a rape victim / comic book writer from New York who decides to get away from all that frightful glamor of the big city and move to a dirty and rundown little city where she finds shelter in a trailer of a single width on a land . Lot mid 12 and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, but she is also mentally ill for inviting crazy men to her trailer. Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to put herself in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was the best high school. He is one of those pretty cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the race has not been kind and Mother Nature has been correct. For the previous commentator who says that the performance was "so real", well, I agree. Actually I was not acting. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this movie is a shit like no other, the rent to laugh at it. The real crime scene? The atrocious wooden panels in the trailer, enough for me to commit murder. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-wide trailer and more than a sun-yellow Chevy Chevette for God's sake!
