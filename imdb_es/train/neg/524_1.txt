"The 40-year-old Virgin" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world in which an employee of an electronics store can tell his boss to "fuck off" and that he releases videos of his naked ass throughout the store and does not rebuke them. A world in which it is really fun to go drunk driving and crash into other people's cars. A world where it seems correct that a boss sexually harasses his subordinates. A world full of furious and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I am absolutely surprised by the apparent chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought that each scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch; To begin with, it was not very funny and it extended beyond all rational thinking. The waxing scene lasted FOREVER. <br /> <br /> The characters, apart from Carell, were a single note. And the romantic elements were completely devised, in particular the scene in which Keener finds pornography in Carell's apartment. That was just lame. <br /> <br /> And I also found the sequence "Aquarius" totally annoying and excessive. I hated hating I hated this movie!
