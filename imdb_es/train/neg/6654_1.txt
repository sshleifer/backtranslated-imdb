In general, I do not think Hollywood productions are apt to be called a movie, that's why I call them "movies." But this piece of elephant dung is not even worthy of being called a film, hence the citations in the title. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of the geriatric casting, surely that is the epitome of it. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone LESS than half her age, she's supposed to play an 18-year-old boy, and HAVE IT when she's forty! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid senseless portrait of Paris and France, where we see clich√© characters like: the friendly owner of a bad-tempered shop, the evil queen of models, the fairy god mother former queen of the models, etc. This film only exceeds in this respect for the Da Vinci Code, (which the reviewers correctly determined was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is extremely ridiculous not to have nudity in a movie about a time and place where nudity was such a commonplace, especially if the whole focus is on that <br /> <br / > 4. The horrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The music elevator of Nana Mouskouri! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think this is enough. And I was able to make these observations after seeing this shit for only half an hour, WHILE surfing the Internet and talking with my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
