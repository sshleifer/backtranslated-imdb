I'm a big fan of movies. I like movies of all kinds. You could say that this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I understand that it follows the book closely, which raises the fact that not everything should turn into a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not extravagant, they are mentally ill. Things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considering that they are supposed to be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another film I hated, just Running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I will never return those hours again. I wanted to wash my brain after looking.
