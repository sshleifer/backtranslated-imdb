Hit!!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to discover that she was in two short scenes towards the end. Apart from that, I was basically pressing the fast forward button all the time. Some teenager goes to Romania with his dad and is bitten by a wolf and becomes a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years ago, but he does not age a little and enrolls in a high school. There she meets a shy teacher who ends up biting and then has children with her. This movie sucks and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one !!
