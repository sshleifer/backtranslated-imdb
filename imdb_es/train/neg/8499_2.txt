This is the kind of thing that only now thrills the eggheads of the movie. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that Real Men sees nothing of Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It could have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say, here. The reason for the camera as a voyeur was nothing new. Have we all forgotten the "bicycle thief" of De Sica? Or something from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is the extended metaphor of the young man like Truffaut, who spends all his free time 'ruining his eyes' in the cinema, who ruins school discipline, is accused of plagiarism (the many small robberies), and ultimately, escapes to the social confines to make "his own movie". I'm sorry ... I've been there, done that many times to make this matter.
