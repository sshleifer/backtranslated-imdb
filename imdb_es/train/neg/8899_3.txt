Where is it written that the sequels must stink? Scream 2 did not do it! Others not! But this sure yes ... the problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could act in the whole movie), bad writing (you will never understand what is happening and I have even investigated the idea of ​​Nephilim before), and just horrible options for the casting Eric Roberts is the most stupid Archangel Michael I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague unless you're desperate to see Christopher Walken. In that case, simply advance to the parts where it is in the film and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
