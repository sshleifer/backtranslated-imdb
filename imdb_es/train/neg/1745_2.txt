The first half hour of the film had a constant rhythm and introduced the characters. however, suddenly, everything happened too fast, a boring reason for Akshey Kumar to go out with 3 girls, very loud about the performance of Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. In general, this movie was the biggest disappointment that the movie does not do justice to his trailer. save money and do not watch this movie, look at Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> summarizing it: a cheap stage show and an appearance for the film without history or substance, the plot was extraordinarily no- Feel the good music of Preetam, the man who bought us Dhoom! Keep going! The film was filmed in a single room, the new participants (female cast) were fine, since it was their first film, but established actors like Akshey and John completely disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan who gives his worst movie!
