Really bad shooting in the video "movie" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video creators. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least throw some blood, blood and blood. nakedness. There is some blood provided by the arm cut latex accessories bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and whores but not naked or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects: fades, cleans, etc. Occasionally a little black appears to separate the scenes. <Br /> <br /> Terrible music from bad heavy metal bands whose websites occupy most of the final credits. Werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached only to the face of the "actors". They did not even bother applying brown makeup on their neck, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10 year old boy with a video camera could put together a better movie. There is no reason to buy, rent or watch this movie, except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.
