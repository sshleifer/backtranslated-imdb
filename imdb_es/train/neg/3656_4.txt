I must admit that I've been a fool for Samurai movies since I can remember. I used to see something indiscriminate, be it "elitist" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic book variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked the American / Japanese "Crossovers" like The Bushido Blade. And, of course, everything that contains Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've virtually seen all the Samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993 I saw Kabuto on video for the first time, that even Samurai movies can be boring. At first I expected Mayeda to arrive in Europe and the confrontations that would arise from that, but when he arrived in Spain, I did not care much about the film. <br /> <br /> It would not do the movie justice to call it "bad". Technically it is a clean entry in the genre. But there is simply never enough silence. Sho Kosugi has limited abilities as a director and actor and has only a fraction of the charisma of the aforementioned Japanese actors. And speaking of Sho Kosugis's son, Kane, who appears in almost all of Sho Kosugi's films as Shos's son: he has not inherited his father's limited acting abilities. Adding to the negative points is the absence of blood and blood that until then was a trademark of all Samurai movies. Obviously, this was intended for a younger audience in the United States and Europe. <br /> <br /> Let's say it's a regular movie for the historical action adventure fan, but a bore for Samurai movie fans. Fans of the genre "Samurai meet ???" they should go see Red Sun (1971), presenting Charles Bronson as a cowboy who has to team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from the evil Alan Delon. . More or less how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> Therefore, although the movie is only 100 minutes, it seems like a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why I gave this honorable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kosugi can really be understood. I must admit that his 'Engrish' is sometimes funny, but he gets tired after about 30 minutes.
