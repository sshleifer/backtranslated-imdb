... but I regret having seen it. Given that the IMDb ratings are relatively high (and must also have been relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a soft comedy from the UK, a category that has produced many movies that I liked. . immensely. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of comedies without laughter, usually populated by Hollywood films produced and directed by people without talent. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress, and I've liked her in other films. The concept: a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome the hardship that confronts himself after the death of her husband, does not offend me. Despite the energetic efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on its face (falling flat could have been funnier) as far as me and my wife are concerned. Be forewarned, oh gentle reader, not all unsuccessful British comedies succeed. This is a failure.
