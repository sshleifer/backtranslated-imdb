A man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just left an institution and is also VERY rich! Suddenly, he begins to hear noises and to see skulls all over the place. Is she going crazy again or does the first wife come back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You've probably guessed the end, so I will not explain it. I saw him many times on Saturday afternoon on television when I was a kid. Back then, I liked it but I was young. Seeing it now I realize how bad it is. She is horribly acted, badly written, very boring (even at an hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one of them is the director)! He still has some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is a little spooky and the atmosphere itself with the huge empty house and the nearby pond is very nice. There are also some moments of fear (I jumped a little when he saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. In short, it is NOT a good movie ... but it is not a total disaster either. He has a small cult. I give it a 2. <br /> <br /> I also try to avoid the edition of Elite DVD Drive-in (it's paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is in TERRIBLE form with jumps and scratches everywhere. He did not even look so bad on TV!
