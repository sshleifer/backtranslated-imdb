['I have to say that I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in that. About half an hour of boring conversation, sorry for all who really care about the plot, I started to move to the scenes of Gerry. I really do not know the end, I was so bored with that. If Gerry was not in it, I probably did one of two things: I fell asleep or turned it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as it is in most of his previous films. If you&#39;re a Gerry fan, do not worry, it&#39;s as lovely and lovely as it always is, but if you really want to see the movie for the plot, good luck because you&#39;ll need it, that or many things. Coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /><br /> 4/10 ... and that&#39;s just because the casting director had the sense of putting Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to spell his name!']
