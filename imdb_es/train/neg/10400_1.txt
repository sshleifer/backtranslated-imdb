It's enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making films based on a concept that has died a long time ago. The first Tremors movie was great. The second was ridiculous. The third was nauseating. The television series was depressingly horrible. And this movie simply deepens the bet. <br /> <br /> Basically, another excuse for computer effects and cheap puppets, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in the nineteenth century, and fight against the graboids. Like a rehash of the first, they have to learn to beat them again. A little entertaining, I suppose. Otherwise, this direct release to the video, like Tremors 2 and 3, is going too far. Oh, and I keep wondering how there's never a record of these events ... Did they just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be making history, so our friends in the first film would not be so ill prepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this that ruin the original drive me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
