Clean premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that rushing madly out of control to go to the weekend booth may not be the best idea after all. I loved the way Bill gets out of the car and downhill without suffering any injury! Unfortunately, you can not say the same for your girl. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the accident. <br /> <br /> Many scenes dragging, including a simple stripper (still have nightmares of that scene). Poor assistant and his useless hand. I admit that I was intrigued to see what mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HAHAHA!! The girl really seemed sadistically angry at being revived. Personally, I would really like a new body after an unbearable experience like that!
