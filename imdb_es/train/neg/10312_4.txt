As an impressionable child of 10 years, I liked the philosophy of "love conquers everything" of the comedy of the 70s "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy, which referred to the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and a teacher at the Irish Catholic school (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the interreligious marriage of the young couple. <br /> <br /> Looking at the program now with years of personal life experiences, I am surprised that the program was even a success for one, albeit, highly rated season. Created by the veteran television writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the cancellation of the program would write the successful play "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own weight. br /> <br /> There was no denying the chemistry of real life between Birney and Baxter. But, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his brief role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here, they were trying to breathe life into a program that needed a great comedic advantage, which could have given more complications to a very controversial issue. <br /> <br /> The program aired on Saturday nights between two CBS powers. : "Everyone in the family" and "Mary Tyler Moore." Both shows were smart, funny and had enough advantage (more than the first one in the second) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and just had some occasional laughs. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a program that really was not as good as I remembered it.
