The woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) pursues the Man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) for the father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants the man to invest some of the money of the deceased mother in the father's business venture; but, the father is notorious for losing money on crazy plans. Someone knows it, but the true evil ones are man's best friends to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> The production seems attractive, but the story does not compromise. The players do not play well drunk. Remarkable as the first appearance of Broderick Crawford - as gopher "Hunk"; Aside from running errands, Mr. Crawford is trapped on the floor by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Woman chases man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
