This goes back to the days of the matinee, when the children who had nowhere to go to hang out took the dates to the balcony after leaving their younger brothers below. It did not matter what was on the screen: little children sat through it and the big kids ignored it. Adults, of course, would never see it. <br /> <br /> But they put it on video, anyway, along with most of the other horror films "B" of the Golden Age ... of television. The inherent and unintentional humor of this film derives from the stale ideology (the "bad girls" harvested to replace the crushed body of poor Jan: they had it in their hands), an overused plot (a mad scientist, trying to interpret God), a violent but conscientious monster (whose presence in the rural laboratory of scientists of normal appearance until now is never completely explained), and the action that polarizes in wood or on top. <br /> <br /> This is a great party movie, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialogs and comments to abominable cinematic feats. In fact, if you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this film is also available in video in its treatment "Mystery Science Theater 3000", in which the host and the puppets of the cult television series make the necessary additions for you.
