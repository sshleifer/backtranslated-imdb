Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of clich√©s, highly predictable, unrealistic and, sometimes, even stupid. However, if you have nothing better to do, it offers 40 minutes of simple and unpretentious entertainment, a host of excellent male and female muscles and an excellent picture of the spectacular Hawaiian landscape. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than that, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked at a hotel or know anything about how to manage one, you have two options : 1. You will feel sick every two minutes for the stupidity and stupidity of how the program presents Hotel Business or, 2. Look at it as a sci-fi comedy like I did, lie down, relax and laugh. that!
