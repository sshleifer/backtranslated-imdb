Tatie Danielle has to do with a frightful old witch who torments her loving and unconscious family out of sheer rancor. There is a bit of subtext that could be related to France's colonial past, but mostly only Danielle is doing the kind of thing (like deliberately leaving a small child in a park) that would soon have a man who would pull out his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, that does not happen here. It looks good and the acting is fine and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it is so INTEGRATING. God, this movie loves itself. Too bad it is not as smart or funny as it seems. The only impetus in the program, I'm sorry, the movie, comes from Danielle becoming increasingly unpleasant, and the only surprise comes from seeing the increasingly unlikely ways of doing it. That's right: as in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the additional 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a runtime of 110 minutes.
