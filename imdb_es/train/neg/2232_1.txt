I saw this ... let me rephrase ... I suffered this because I'm Eva's fan. I do not think this is a movie that she puts on the back of her head and takes pictures. I like the gangsta flix, but this was not even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on the catering service. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before he had the opportunity to worry about that. she or not. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to say who did what and how, because it's not worth the effort. I'm just glad that, because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store, I did not have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> OH! Before you turn me on, I love movies, I thought a lot of things were good that some of you are stuck, so for me, this tells me everything you need to know.
