The only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your average high school writer look good, and acting that is almost as good, gets my score lower. one of Tom Hanks, very early films in which obviously he did not have the pleasure of being really demanding. The best special effect of the film consists of a guy dressed in an incredibly fake rubber monster.
