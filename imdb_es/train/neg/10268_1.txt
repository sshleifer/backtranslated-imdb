Without a doubt, this is one of the worst movies in which I have wasted money! The plot is, erm sorry, did I say there was a plot? The most frightening moment was when ... No, I can not think of one! The best special effect that made me hide under the sheets was ... I can not think of one for that either. You knew who the murderer was from the beginning. There was nothing scary in the whole movie, in fact, the only two vaguely interesting fragments were when you saw little sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw nurse Toppan take off the lid. This movie should only be seen to get an idea of ​​how NOT to make a horror movie!
