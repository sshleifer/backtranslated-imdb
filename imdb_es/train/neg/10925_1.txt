I am in this moment debating if I should finish seeing this "poppycock" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the movie set buried, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is a buried set, a wolf-headed monster running mad, an amulet and a group of bad actors attacked by the masked wolf, whatever it may be. What I would have missed, if I had the wisdom to expel this nonsense is a buggy chase, something really bad in C.G.I., an incredibly stupid dialogue, more badly in C.G.I., and the hero who fights paper cutbacks. Apart from the original idea, this film has zero redeeming qualities. My mistake to keep watching. - MERK
