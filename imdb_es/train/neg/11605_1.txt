At first sight of the slogan of the plot, I thought it could have been a decent movie. Could I have been more wrong? The beginning of the movie makes it look like a bunch of monsters came together and decided to make a low budget movie. During the first 10 minutes, you do not notice the cheesy performance, the horrible sound and the frightening special effects, but then it gets worse. In just 20 minutes he asked me: "What was the plot again?" I could only ask that question when they did not laugh at me because of the absolute lameness of this movie. The main actor has a stage for emotions and he keeps it throughout the whole movie, even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything that was in between. The flashback scene almost made me throw up because it made me relive an extra minute of images from before in the movie. Now we get to the middle of the movie where they are obviously trying to cheat Morpheus from "The Matrix", even though he is doing a horrible job. The actor who talks about "Star Wars" and the phrases of the fortune cookie is almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie because you really think that the plot is finally unfolding. The character "Morpheus" dies, the ONLY good thing in the movie. He pronounces a couple of words and the credits roll. What is this? No plot, bad performance, all corny, could not be worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE!
