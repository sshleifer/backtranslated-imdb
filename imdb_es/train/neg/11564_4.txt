Italian horror movie / suspense about a rich English gentleman who crosses pubs and taverns for red haired girls like his wife Evelyn, recently deceased. You know that he really must have loved his wife, because he takes them to his house, a huge castle in decomposition, and he makes them loose and then tortures them, whips them and kills them. The strangest aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the end of the movie, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the movie HERO. Anyway, soon, under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you're still curious. In addition, family and friends begin to die in the most brutal way. Poor Aunt Agatha (it looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) confronts her fate in a cunning way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And, of course, there is a full explanation of why / how Evelyn did what she did. The director Emilio Miraglia does some things quite well: the adjustments of the film are very suitable for this film, although trying to make us believe that it is England is, at best, ridiculous. None of the actors seems English. Many of them had dark black hair and Mediterranean complexion and dressed an Englishman who would not be caught. Cars drive on the wrong side of the road. But in spite of everything, the scene of the crypt was actually filmed and I also liked the cheesy resolution. And, of course, any movie with the sensual and red-haired Erika Blanc is always an advantage. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however, what I found somewhat frightening with the idea that torturing women was good enough and healthy to relieve one of their mental demons. Let's go.
