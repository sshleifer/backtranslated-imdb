The original Japanese film "Gamera" of 1965 http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of the Gojira (Godzilla) darker and less child-oriented for the sensibilities of the sixties. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying turtle and flamethrower that literally consumes energy, not as big as some versions of Godzilla, but in general it is similar in many ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and cropped by the famous Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" gets more than just the wrong spelling. The American scenes are not as ridiculous or as annoying as those that were added to the great Gojira, but they do not add much to the story because there is little follow-up on them. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with promises, there are some scenes that are worth the development of the character and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside the main plot. However, once Gamera appears, the movie begins to descend towards a fairly common kaiju movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is good enough, even American accessories are fine. The direction is pretty good for this period and genre, and special effects are not bad for their time (all thumbnails). Some of the sets and backgrounds are really good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little or nothing original in this movie. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in her latest films, most of which are worth seeing if you are a kaiju fan.
