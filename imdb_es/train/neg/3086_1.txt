Once I thought "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie that had ever been made ... I was wrong. The "Hobgoblins" surpassed it in all the aspects that I could imagine and some I could not. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in the creation of this atrocity. I will not include a teaser in this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not subject innocent people like you to such torment. In fact, any discussion of the plot related to this film is senseless and demeaning. The words I would use to describe this movie are the following: insipid, stupid and naive. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, PLEASE, do not watch this movie. I beg of you, from one lover of the movie to another ... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE. For the sake of your own sanity and intellect, DO NOT LOOK AT IT. Destroy any copy you find.
