Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's movies, obviously his late 70s masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his dramas from the late '80s and early' 90s ( Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands and Wives) In fact, I even liked some of their most recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks) but this was abysmal, although it could not be worse than last year's Match Point, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was lazily drawn - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes removed - Woody seems to be on the way out as well, dragging most of his phrases and phrases 'hilarious', I mean that with all due respect ...' over and over again until the softness of all this becomes too bare. <br /> <br /> I know most actors are in line. to work with him, but at least they should read the script first (Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this) and Woody should really take a role more behind that of the camera in the future, if he has a sense at about 30 kilometers behind. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so many Woody movies to play. compare this with, but it is clear that his best days have been left behind and, judging by this effort, Woody should call him a day before becoming an industry joke. <br /> <br /> Shamefully wrong.
