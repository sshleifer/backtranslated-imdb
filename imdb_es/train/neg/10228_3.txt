To be honest, I had heard that this was bad enough before deciding to see it, but I am never able to let others influence my vision, in fact, I am more likely to see something out of challenge. Bullwhip had one thing in my favor before the visualization anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were interested interested me immediately. The image is not very good and, in fact, it is morally doubtful, all the characters are corrupt and cunning in one way or one way, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, all this is fine if the film around you can do it. Do justice to a group of despicable people and create a tense image of shuddering climax. Unfortunately it's not like that, and while the end fills your eyes with sugar, you can not stop screaming that you've been tricked into seeing a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast comes out with credit, with leader Guy Madison painfully hard on the end. <br /> <br /> Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
