OSCILLATION! It is an important film because it is one of the remaining films produced and performed in black from the thirties. Many of these movies have simply deteriorated so much that you can not see them, but this one is in pretty good shape. It is also a good opportunity to see many of the talented black artists of the period just after the heyday of the former Cotton Club, a moment almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film is of historical importance and has some lovely performances, it is also a disaster. The main plot is very similar to that of the Hollywood musicals of the time, including a prima donna that will ruin the show and the unknown surprise that appears nowhere to save the day. However, the writing is sometimes horrible and a bit trashy at times, and projects images of Black America that some may find a bit degrading. This is because before the plot really gets going, he is treated to a bum without an account who lives off his wife who works hard (a popular stereotype of the time) and when they catch him with a asshole (who, by the way, this role is totally overplayed), they have a fight that looks like a WWE Smackdown scene! And, the only lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor, a really bad scene! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband hits her in the face and everyone applauds him. It seems that the film, sometimes, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the M√ÅS audience that can not even do it well, with some of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. <Br /> <br /> Even so, if you can see beyond a lousy production in almost every aspect (with grumpy characters, bad acting and direction and bad writing), this could be worth a look so you can see excellent songs and dance tapping - as well as to take a look at the forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about the performance, it's very, very bad!
