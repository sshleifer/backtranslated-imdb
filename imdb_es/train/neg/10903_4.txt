Rob Schneider is a famous comic cause of his movements, facials and "non-human" performances. This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser who tries to be a hero and one day, nobody receives a call from a man who is attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the scene of the crime, he crashes with his car and it gets very bad. He does not remember what happens and, the next day, his life is not the same when he discovers that he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our female that our main character is trying to reach, but her attempts are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is destiny if you could use this metaphor. Marvin should discover how to return to being a normal human being. By the way, his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is regular. The movie is so unreal that it becomes stupid at times, but it's one of those movies, called nonsense fun, as I've written before. So look at it for the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies in history or one of the best movies in which Schneider appears. He is a great comedian, but this is not his best movie.
