Incredibly confused, unpleasant and, ultimately, ridiculous ("the horses, oh my God, the horses!"). It's scary at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. Soft performances by the protagonists, one typically eccentric by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hacking job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even harder to understand. 0 out of 4 stars
