The only reason I saw the movie until the end was the "hope" to see something interesting. The movie is really bad and the performance of the girl is very, very bad, honestly, I am not a film critic or an expert, but you just need common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started talking was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he agreed to help her with the script and appear in her film since she is the brilliant director " .. surprise, surprise, the next day, after watching the movie, I discovered on the Internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. A horrible story and terrible performance.
