Wow, I finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this horrible movie of God, only to discover that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a direct video sequel this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the films reviewed by MST3K - and they really dig from the bottom of the barrel, projecting the 'Hands', 'Werewolf', 'The incredibly strange', and the lesser known, such as 'Laserblast' ',' Zombie Nightmare ',' and 'Time Chasers', this definitely has to be the biggest garbage pile they've ever seen (which makes it perfect for riffing). Very simple, the film is about a group of Munchies gremlins in freedom, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, dexterity and, of course, sex in ways that end up killing people. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who fight in the garden with garden tools), the writing is so forced (as the one often described). scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of a girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so. .. rarely paid attention (hence the MST3K riff on a "law in the future in which filmmakers must make films), which really encourages furry puppets to kill everyone on the screen. Worst movie ... ever.
