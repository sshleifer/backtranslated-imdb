Who in their right mind does something as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> Accidental killing of a security guard ... characters that are so two-dimensional that a two-year-old could have painted ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red toolbox of death? Please ... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /> <br /> Acting from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically this film switches between comedy for teenagers, the thriller, voyeurism and ... feminine ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and it's an insult to anyone who thinks. Do not look, get away, it's more horrible than you imagine ... <br /> <br /> And on top of everything, it's trying to be modern because it's too graphic in its violence ... <br /> <Br /> Mrs. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
