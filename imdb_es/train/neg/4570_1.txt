Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha Lighting School. If you're wondering who the * bleep is * Ramtha: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old spiritual warrior who appeared in JZ Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. Ramtha's copyright and directs sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks the Hollywood version of Elizabethan Hollywood English with a throaty, throaty voice.He has thousands of followers and has won millions of dollars acting as Ramtha in seminars ($ 1,000 per party) and in its Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and the sales of tapes, books and accessories (Clark and Gallo, 1993) .He must have hypnotic powers.Search for personal fulfillment, otherwise, normal people obey their order of spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy labyrinth, without doors. " John Wheeler, one of the best theoretical physicists in the United States, would roll his eyes on this film. In the recent past he has criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. <br /> <br /> There is a great review of this movie in Skeptico. I recommend to anyone who considers watching this movie, read it first before contributing to the chests of a cult. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed a critic here at IMDb says to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to go through the garbage thought of this movie.
