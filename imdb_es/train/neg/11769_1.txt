Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do it. And I'm going to start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee movie, Hulk, because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even premium cable channels rarely seemed to show it. I finally decided to see him yesterday on the EE network. UU And, wow ... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /> <br /> It was boring! I almost could not survive Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was left speechless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was nasty (and that's not fun, he's usually a great character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his indescribable face was the easiest to imitate with computer graphics, and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk should look like Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When the Hulk fought a mutant poodle, he was ready to recognize the Hulk as the worst superhero movie. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. Approximately 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a really exciting extended action scene and, dare I say it, reasonably convincing, that starts when the Hulk comes out of a containment chamber on a military base, fighting against M1 tanks and Comanche. Helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor in the stratosphere, only to be captured in the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say that the CGI was pretty good. That does not mean that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it did not require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in many action movies that are not superheroes. And that is quite a feat. <br /> <br /> Of course, the ending became really stupid with Bruce Banner's father becoming a kind of shape-shifting villain, but the long sequence of previous action put to shame any of the brief acts heroic heroes of Iron Man. And in general, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really seemed that the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that it was real and that it really interacted with its surroundings. It was certainly better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Good, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It's boring too! It has only a few Hulk appearances and here's the thing: the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version seemed fake at times and cartoony in others, but it also had its convincing moments. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. He had a skin tone and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer generated texture. It was really absurd. The lighting, the environment and the facial effects did not seem 5 years newer than those of Ang Lee, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We are really living in an era in which computer programmers can ruin a movie as well as any director, actor or cinematographer could. <br /> <br /> Worse, the writer and director of this film learned almost nothing from Ang Lee's "failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems more false than Hulk. The love interest is not convincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are pretty easy to see). Tim Blake Nelson exaggerates almost as much as Nick Nolte, although he is only in the film for a few minutes. Hulk really does not do much in this movie, certainly not more than in the Ang Lee version. The Incredible Hulk was a little faster, but since nothing really happens, it's not worth much. Oh yes, the villain is as fake as the Hulk. Actually, it is much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can definitely say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the opportunity to see the Ang Lee version again, I could sit down to watch the good action sequences, or Another thing is to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (most likely I will just get ahead of the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of the stack of superhero movies. The CGI cartoon is an insult to the audience, at least in Ang Lee's version, it seems that they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> It's absolutely mental. It's amazing how the filmmakers tried to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by doing almost exactly the same movie. <br /> <br /> It's for Edward Norton's credit that he seems to have distanced himself from this movie.
