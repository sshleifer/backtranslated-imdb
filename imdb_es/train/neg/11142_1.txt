This is the worst piece of shit I've had to see, in fact, it was so bad that I HAD TO LOOK AT IT :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is so bad it's fun! It's not even close to the crap CGI animations in Spawn, that's how bad it is, har har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the fact that some distribution company has actually put money to liberate. this on DVD, but I think they will get more money that way, since the cost of doing so could not have been more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that a kindergarten class could have done it. <br /> <br /> See it and laugh!
