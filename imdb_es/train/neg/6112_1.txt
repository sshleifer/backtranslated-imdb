I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York had 16 points in Germany, I entered the film as an alternative. It was so boring. Then I realized that this was crap where a husband exhibits his wife. I mean that today you do it through the Internet and pay for instant access. More than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry about wasting time with this movie. This is a soft-porn for school children. Undress Bo Derek and paint her with color - pretty. But then they should name the movie Undressing Bo and paint it.
