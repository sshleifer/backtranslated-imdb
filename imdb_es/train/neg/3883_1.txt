No just kidding. It was frightening. <br /> <br /> Last night I was watching my local science fiction station, which plays movies every night within a monthly theme. This month is "Space turkeys, or: how I learned to stop worrying and love bombs". Films so bad that they should never have been made. This was a good selection. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is completely horrible, with two exceptions, gore makeup (which showed potential) and editing (which came out slightly from the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible). The acting is horrible everywhere, the dialogue is horrible, the script, the direction. It is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and space filing material. I will focus on the gore. Upon seeing this film, I thought: "What was the motivation behind the making of this movie?" People like to do things, of course, but I hesitated to think that something good could have worked for anyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the Demo Reel of Make-up Effects. He (Rick Baker) actually had a very good career, worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), plus a series of other notable films . Apart from that, I can not say that I have ever SEEN a true fusion man live, incredible or otherwise, but I have to say that this seems to be a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of a bad edition, I usually think of a scene where someone is talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps on his shoulder, or something like that. This movie really serves to highlight the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, scenes that are too long and absolutely useless. Almost all the scenes went on longer than they should have, from a bit of dead air to that crazy screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And that head cut in the river, the head is thrown into a river (in slow motion), the film continues for a couple of minutes, and then we cut off the floating head and see it fall down a waterfall. Although I'm sure everyone was very proud of his severed head, what the hell? <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll mention the fat lady / slow motion scene almost at the beginning. The abrupt slow motion tells me that originally they did not shoot the scene in slow motion, but later they decided that "it was not working like that" and then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any case, if you ever see another movie in which a fat, hysterical woman runs down a hallway and then directly through a closed glass door, all in slow motion, remember, remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, because * this * is where everything started. <br /> <br /> Movies like this one look better at home with a group of friends. This is a bit slow most of the time, but that's all the time to create your own phrases. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty bad.
