This was not really a very good movie. There were many improbable and predictable things that happened during the course of the film ... but I think that most critics lack the point of why a large audience should enjoy this movie. THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not that enough to inspire us all to see this movie? A movie produced by a former NBA star does not appear every day, you know? Wonderfully stupid children in a big house who are hit by an ax with a psychopath. Each clich√© trotted for us to moan. Adolescent sex And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Drug use in adolescents! Hijinx school! And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
