The movie is a bit tedious. It is mainly a silent film, with the bulk of the story provided through a series of voice-overs. Although making a silent movie like this is not a bad idea, this is one of those movies where the lack of dialogue and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious. You do not understand the reason for tedium until you get into the image, and by then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the film are something like a slow part of soft Mexican pornography, and soft pornography without imagination in that sense. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes starts to make sense, but it is too late, because by then the audience is lost. There are some good shooting locations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wonder why more films are not filmed there. The campus is built on the edge of the lava fields that give the campus a sense of another world. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without considering how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
