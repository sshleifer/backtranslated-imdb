Formula flick of a boy who wants a girl, a boy who will lie to be next to a girl, a boy who will get a best friend to help in an outrageous way (comedus reliefus, right?) To help deceive a girl, etc. and with the rare exception of some exits classified by z, it has been done better. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the argument, the contacts are attractive and there are a couple of good times. Jonathon Schaech has done better, and his performance here was close to being telephoned. It is not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this timid affair.
