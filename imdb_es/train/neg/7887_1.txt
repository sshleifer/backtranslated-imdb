... then they will have a suitable place to file this shit. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is mumbo-jumbo religious. I kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" they promised me, but the "bad" in this movie would only be unimaginable for a five-year-old with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Actually, I managed to find some actors from bigger names willing to get involved in this shame. Unfortunately, my opinion about them has always changed, and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I am also a bit annoyed because now I have a writer's name and a director's name to memorize, since from now on I will avoid everything they do like the plague. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics who post here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. They will get their comments posted first. This could lead to more people being tricked, as I was doing, into believing that this movie was more than a religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's time for the video store to return the money for false advertising. Too bad they can not give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was really a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
