Being a fan of movies like "Fire Sale", "Where's Poppa", "Airplane", I saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of comedies and real satires like those mentioned above. Well, INCORRECT CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> Not only is this not funny, it also makes you angry because it is not bad in a nasty and pleasant way, but in a really bad way. It's bad-bad The script does not contain a single funny line, which is rather a bit when you try to entertain the audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin's speech impediment is probably the most annoying thing about this movie. Even so, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being presumptuous throughout the film and it is very difficult for him not to look at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits very well with the constant errors of continuity and the whirlwind of history, if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon: I had to think of Jay Leno, another person who talked late at night. , who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen some Leno movies and it's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines that he has given him. I'm not easily scared by bad comedies, so I kept looking and looking for all the jokes every 5 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> The film becomes a kind of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over. - Literally he does: from the 75 minutes of the movie, he is in every scene. But it's too little, too late. <br /> <br /> When the films try to trick you into believing that their lack of professionalism is the reason why they are supposed to love you, because they have the right intentions, they remind me of students who have not been prepared for an exam In those cases you have to stay strict and the grade must be an 'F'. (But, please, do not assume that I am a teacher.) That is a profession with respect between the politician and the child molester.) <br /> <br /> If you are really looking for a horror / science fiction movie that is enjoyable to watch and contains jokes, try "Man with the Screaming Brain" by Bruce Campbell. Or look Sunshine / Core if you prefer a shallow and noisy SciFi Schlock. Those are equally funny, though involuntarily.
