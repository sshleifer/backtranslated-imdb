The horror images of Poverty Row of the 1930s and 40s depress me a lot. God knows I have nothing against low budget movies, but those produced in that period have such a sad and miserable appearance, and, ultimately, are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than dreck at the bottom of the barrel like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, beyond his heyday "Dracula", plays another crazy doctor; The unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a young doubtful reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also available, which could please fans of the films of the 30s and 40s.
