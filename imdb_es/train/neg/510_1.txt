This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made and released by an important Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialogue is written in clich√©s; You can complete a lot of sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron's. The "choreography" is silly and totally non-erotic. One can only sympathize with the critic who saw the 23-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexual; It is merely a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is especially ridiculous. If you like bad movies and you enjoy laughing at some of the Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colored version on VHS, making the movie worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. And she is the best part of this movie. What a way to launch a career.
