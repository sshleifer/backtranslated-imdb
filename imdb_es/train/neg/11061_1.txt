Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing part of this movie is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons that only they know, the creators of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? Man gave a new meaning to the term "licking his fingers"! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forward, I had trouble following the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's performance was not so bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T.", in which he plays a disgruntled former policeman. Anyway, I would rate this as a 1/10. He only got a 1 due to Renner's regular performance. There are a lot of books and television documentaries that do a better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one
