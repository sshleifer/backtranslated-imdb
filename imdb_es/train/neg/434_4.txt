Already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. <br /> <br /> When a rejection by the Jehovah's Witness gets its own documentary about films? or anything for that matter, it's time for anyone to get theirs. Although much, much smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, it's not too hard) Zizek's mouth throws as much nonsense as hers, a different kind. It combines the worst of its two professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are known for conveniently offering the expert b * lls *** osopher a lot of room for maneuver to create non-demonstrable theories, to rant without a beginning or an end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process, making misuse of the English language when creating a semantic. Revolutionary only a mother can love. Example: There are three main Marx brothers, so it is a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the superego. I am surprised that he has not reproduced a "Snowhite" clip and that he makes an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (the Muslim hell). It's like the premise of "The Number 23" by Schumacher: play with the numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of Cockamamie theory you want, even linking the ancient Greeks to the death of Princess Di. <br /> <br />, there is an element of entertainment for TPGTC: to observe a lunatic sweat like a pig while they pronounce masked delirious songs, since the intellectual analysis can be quite funny. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other crazy drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a funny train crash. It is true that he is almost funny once or twice. <br /> <br /> I have always been surprised by people who are desperately trying to turn the making of films into an exalted intellectual social science. When thinking about idiotic movies like "Aves" so much, hence his merit, his creator probably laughs in his grave. The truth is that the vast majority of movies have a null intellectual value, and the few that do have some intelligence do not require that a philosopher become a philosopher draw a map to understand them. Unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs should be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the orifice of the bathtub in the shower scene "Psycho", I thought he was going to say something about the galactic black holes; how it drains the life of the stars just when the orifice of the bathtub sucks the blood of Janet Leigh. Or maybe he could have said that the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing towards her instead of going out (as in menstruation), which represents some kind of "intelligent irony (zizekiana)". Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really thought so much about each scene (and the script), his films would not have been the illogical and exaggerated shit they often are. The purpose of these cockpit orifice analogies was to show how easy it is to improvise on "deep and hidden meanings." And when he adds Zizek's fantastic terminology to philosophy and psychology, superimposing these terms on these analogies as wedding cake decorations, he gets a jumble that can instantly impress those without education, that is, they are easily impressionable and credulous <br /> Zizek says several funny things (unintentionally) here, one of the most absurd ideas is when he associates Anthony Perkins' cleanliness of the bloody bathroom with "the satisfaction of work, of a job well done". Do not laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of "Psycho" could have even thought vaguely of the idea that Perkins could be enjoying a job well done: cleaning a toilet stained with blood, while they conceived / they directed that. scene. Talk about putting the words in your mouth (dead), but in the context of a misinterpretation of what the director had to "say". <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's fantastic "Solaris", but then he has to spoil a rare good impression by dragging "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog towards its plastic bone. "I just want to play with him all day!" Logic has its rules, and it is not supposed to be violated, at least not publicly, by people like him. He seems to consider logic, proof, common sense and reason as enemies or mere disposable toys; Concepts that should be avoided, twisted to fit the final objective or simply annihilated. Zizek is the hippie with LSD shot, and all his favorite movies are his own "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses too much on two of the most over-rated directors, and whose films often Lack of intelligence, in any case, like Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility I was surprised that De Palma did not have a more prominent role; that is another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with the incomprehensible "Lost Highway" by Lynch. There are as many interpretations of that film as people who saw it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer easily accepts the "innovative" physical configuration of von Trier in "Dogville" made me laugh <br /> <br /> However, Zizek not only invents things as it progresses, it also takes pleasure in the "obvious hemorrhage". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he wraps his "observations" very trite in joints (if they are full of spitting) and, sometimes, complex of language. After all, sociology works in exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we are listening to something new when in reality it is what we all know, but said in an eloquent way, what deceives the most attentive listeners. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the men in white suits would suddenly appear out of nowhere and tie him in a loonie suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: as soon as a stalker in a park childish near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
