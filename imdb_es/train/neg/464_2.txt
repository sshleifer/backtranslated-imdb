This movie is not, in any way, fun, but it tries to be funny with its bad mood, which is so dry and boring that the movie is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the whole movie, I thought of one thing: "when will this end?" One thing you have to do is that they have very few fun moments, and that's why I also gave you a total of 2 stars. It is unoriginal and consumes almost all the old blonde jokes in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. Basically it is a movie to belittle the blondes and record the whole repertoire of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is in a blonde mood and it's not worth paying any money for Mira, it's so bad.
