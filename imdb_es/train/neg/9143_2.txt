As an actor, I like independent films very much, but this is, at best, amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a civil service, but when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree, did the directors know that Las Palmeras is not in Vermont? Pines yes - no palms. And the same for the wedding service: again, a nice grove of palm trees. <br /> <br /> When the guys leave VT, apparently they could not get a ticket on any of the major airlines since the plane that was filmed is Federal Express. Did they send themselves overnight in a box? Come on, guys, little details like this separate an indi movie from a totally amateur person. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much happier than Arthur with his bleached hair and the tattoo of a tribal band. The two should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> The minor characters are ridiculous and exaggerate something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applaud the directors for making a gay movie but pay attention to their locations and casting next time
