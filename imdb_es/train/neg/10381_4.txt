The defiant thriller of a haunted house finds an American family moving into a 200-year-old house in Japan where a violent suicide triangle of love took place. <br /> <br /> The configuration of the novel is the only element of interest in this very slow horror movie by the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leaders anywhere in general. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male leader visits a temple after realizing that his house is obsessed as the monk had previously warned. The monk tells the story of the house (with which the viewer is already familiar in the opening sequence) and then the movie simply cuts to something else. Previously, the monk had offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention is made of the monk until near the end, when he reappears to do what he should have done an hour earlier: try to drive to the spirits. outside the house, although at this point it is difficult for the spectators to worry. <br /> <br /> There are some (probably) unintentional campies that laugh when they see that the American actors in the end are possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly I start doing bad martial arts, I say this probably because the scene remembers more than a small duel of the chainsaw duel of the Motel Hell of the same director, which was obviously meant to be fun, but in general this is a mistake that can not be forgotten.
