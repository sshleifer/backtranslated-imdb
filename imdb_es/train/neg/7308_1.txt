Liongate has yet to prove his worth. Each lionsgate movie has been abysmal. I have tried to give them more opportunities and they just slap me again and again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie, it was very frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Guy cuts dead dog for some reason. It is infected with a random virus, it is transferred to the children in a camp, the children begin to become infected and die, the city discovers it and, instead of helping them, it kills them. Then the water becomes infected and everyone dies. the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely retarded, you do not care about any of them, and the only child should have gotten stuck. with boy knows world. My friend and I discovered that talking about how fat and malicious it was that our only classmate was much more pleasant than paying attention to this movie. We managed to get to the end while shouting bulls $ @ t, because this movie will make you do that. <br /> <br /> and I am still confused by the random movements of slow-motion karate from the only random child and how apparently everyone in the country is completely retarded and crazed. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why did children who tried to kill sit in a chair waiting to be killed? Was that part of their plan? Wow. The best plan of all. I can not believe that this movie has a theatrical premiere. I could barely stand the DVD, let alone sit in a theater without moving for an hour and a half. It was not scary, or fun, or great, or anything. It's just a 90-minute waste that I could be using to ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. It's more productive than this piece of garbage. The acting, the special effects, and the script are a joke. Never pick this up <br /> <br /> The cabin fever has an unpleasant leg-shaving scene of 10
