From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a stink in your hands! This movie had potential. Underneath all the mud are the remains of what could have become a decent movie, if not an interesting one. However, the final product is a real disaster. Apart from the free nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II ends up being a ridiculous excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him some credibility, but even he can not raise it above the level of shit. <br /> <br /> As you have never seen any of the other movies in this series, this reviewer will be forced to accept in person. We appreciate that this is a genuine continuation of the events in the first part. We started at a funeral for one of the characters of the original, and in the first ten minutes we were in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight against a group of werewolves. The pace of the movie is pretty good, and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; It just is not filmed well. A bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Although his song is played quite often, it is quite catchy. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie are very numerous. First, the performance is worse than regrettable. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. The two main tracks, Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe, lack almost everything that is desired for such characters. Writing is miserable, redundant editing and amateur management. There are a couple of good special effects tricks, but those of cheese weigh a lot in number. Sybil Danning is nice to watch, but her acting as an actress is not satisfactory. Judd Omen looks at the role he plays, but his voice and his acting are not convincing to say the least. Much of the dialogue is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea of ​​the story. I always enjoy the stories of true believers to fight against seemingly invincible forces of evil. A scene in which a small group of good guys is walking through a dark forest and knocking down a group of werewolves is even something exciting. More or less. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the movie a bit more convincing. 3 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Side note: At the time of writing this article, the youtube.com censors have not yet eliminated the final credits with Sybil Danning. From its top several times, while the song of Babel sounds! Catch it while you can!
