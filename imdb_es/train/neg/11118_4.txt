This was a popular movie, probably due to the humor in it, the rapidly moving story, a character who does not remember and who keeps silent about all the noise, etc. The funny thing is that you probably can not make a movie with this title if you substitute someone. but "white" like anything else would be considered racist by the PC police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson as the white man who turns out to be as good or no better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting just like his main counterpart, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had many funny phrases, which provided a lot of humor. The bad part of the film, which does not bother many people, is the extreme blasphemy that is here and the laziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are not really clean and nice people in this movie. For that reason, I honestly can not recommend the movie, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lot of bad words.
