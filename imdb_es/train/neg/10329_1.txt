I'm trying to imagine the pitch of Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of the Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, I'm thinking of that girl who plays Faith in Angel, dressed in shiny black leather - or a girl like her, leave that with us, just get this! plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just a few strong punches and a hot girl in shiny black leather astride a great throbbing bike.The fanboys choose strong punches and hot girls in shiny black leather astride big throbbing bicycles, Right? "<br /> <br /> Striking, superficial, dismal, formulated, dispassionate, tedious, dull, dumb, humorless, unpleasant, barely competent. Live anime action without any action, nor life. SF the way Joe Fanboy likes, in fact. :(
