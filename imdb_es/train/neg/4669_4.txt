It is interesting that a novel without an argument has become the basis of two films. While The Heiress was a good adaptation, if not quite accurate, Washington Square is a tough hand and bad performance, except for the part of Dr. Sloper, a movie that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I really shuddered. It has nothing of the simple and sober beauty that a movie without an argument can have, like Onegin. I agree with other comments about Leigh's description of Catherine as an idiot, rather than naive and timid; It made me despise her for not feeling her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childhood confidence to adult cynicism, the whole point of history, was internalized, just as it was in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a movie! I think someone skipped the adaptation class at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to make a touching and beautiful film from a difficult text, but it just did not work.
