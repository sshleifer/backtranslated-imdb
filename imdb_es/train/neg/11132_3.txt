A documentary maker, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe completely fails in this effort, gathering uninspired fragments of Chomsky's wisdom on a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is filmed in an amateur and video format. The only effort of Pascoe to unite the fragments into a whole is to periodically throw a vague title on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth". <br /> <br /> Lick. <br /> Compare this with documentaries like "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" that create a narrative drawing material from interviews, footage and footage. In the end, each one delivers a moving and intelligent message with dexterity and intelligence. <br /> <br /> The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky's insinuations of historical dogmas, and the fact that the execution time is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's account of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more compliant with dissenting views, while the liberal dogma of NPR lashes out at his interviewees and dramatically limits his permissible messages. Another means of communication to be skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is only for the finalists of Noam Chomsky.
