I picked it up for 50 cents at the flea market, I was pretty excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then just repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It's a good view Mick and the gang at their best, I wish there was not so much dialogue dubbing to be able to hear what they say and play. <br /> <br /> The parodies are politically outdated and incredibly naive and simple. of poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at the latest versions of the '60s in England, rather than what was really going on in the stupid sketches. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times really change, and what was important quickly becomes simple. silly. Good song, but now it has been played to death by this DVD.
