This is one of the worst movies in history. I like corny movies, but this is just horrible. Where are the images in the movie that are in the box? I think more money was spent on the illustrations in the DVD box than in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so deceptive? I feel like an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I explored IMDb, I should have researched a little and made a list before visiting my local video rental store. I do not have anyone to blame, except myself. I want my money and time ago. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, put cocktail umbrellas in your eyes. It will be much more pleasant. You have been warned!
