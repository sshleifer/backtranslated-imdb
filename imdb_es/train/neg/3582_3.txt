No, it's not the horror movie ... This is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman who stands between them. He loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion arrives, that is. Even though she marries One Round, she starts flirting openly with the champion until the final boxing match between One Round and the champion. She returns to the corner of One Round, just when things look bleaker, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and get his wife back. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career. but the limitations of time must not have made him make a lasting film. Although there are special tricks for the film, and some relief with the comedy, this film is not compatible with any of his later works. However, it must have been extremely risky during the period of time, with the shameless adulterous wife. That may have been the draw in 1927. While I watch all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could remake themselves on today's screen and really disappear. Maybe I should be the only one ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you're planning to see all of Hitchcock's films. You could fall asleep in the middle.
