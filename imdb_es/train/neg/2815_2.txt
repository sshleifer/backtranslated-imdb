Poor Robert Englund makes another failure and, at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes pretty good horror films, but he failed a lot in this one. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, who in the seventeenth century was imprisoned for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of bringing pain on himself, as well as seeing others also feel pain. The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and I got confused with what was happening and what was the purpose of this film. All I saw was a young woman who was trapped by a strange lesbian who wanted to keep her quiet and the young woman was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and discovers that he wants to kill her and then Englund approaches. from one century to the next, it is said that he is a descendant of De Sade and tries to kill her because it reminded him of Madam Momoselle (spelled badly) or whoever was in the picture on the wall of De Sades. The movie was terrible, I'm surprised that Hooper hired Englund in this movie and that the special effects were so false and ridiculous, especially the part of the eyes. Englund tries to make a reappearance of his movement "Nightmare on Elm St." Using these syringes to get people's eyes out and out. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
