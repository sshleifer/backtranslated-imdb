Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy film that uses around 1979 ideas of what constitutes an illicit affair for 13-year-old girls. The script, the rhythm and the direction are uniformly horrible. The action sequences challenge the belief. The characters speak with the simplified diction that is generally found in movies directed to children under 10, but also includes multiple sexual references that include the character of Shields, as well as graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy on some level, but it's never fun, an image of adventure but the plot and the action are insipid, and a movie for children, but it presents pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. He also wants to be a friend's photo, an image of coming of age, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travel notebook and a western. The general effect is massive stupidity with an unpleasant turn. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see many incredible photos of the Grand Canyon. That he manages to do well.
