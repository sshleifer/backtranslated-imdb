Seeing "Speak easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director and trick under this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a falling fabric, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed in Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is misinterpreted as Professor Post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him from saying: "Tell me about rabbits, George." (Post would have said something like: "Please inform me about the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, which I think is mainly treated with the epithet" George ".") When Keaton created His own characters, they could be carefree but they were not stupid. They were quick studies and they became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops tripping and stumbling and who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat on the Titanic. And while the original characters of Keaton had a charming naivety and innocence, Post presents itself as a deep sexual delay that, if ever physically aroused, puts a bag of ice on the swelling and seeks medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of small redeeming moments, like Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampire Thema Todd or his suggestion about the proper attire for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth it to endure the entire film for see them. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak easily" with your friends, at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But aside from that, stay with the silences. That is 100% of what is remembered Buster Keaton.
