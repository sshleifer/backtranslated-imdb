Some may make fun, but in reality there is a real art with making particularly bad films. This is lost on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A group of young people, women with bulging breasts and wet shirts continuously, of course, go to film "blood surf" and end up crashing with a crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only the crocodile is obviously false, but some of the accessories [notice that the boat that hits the reef in particular] seems to have come from the thunder birds! <br /> <br /> It's not good, from start to finish. Do not see it!
