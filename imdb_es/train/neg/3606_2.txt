This movie is the worst, but for me it is very high. This is how a slasher movie should be. It takes place in a university where there only seems to be a handful of students. The teachers are stupider than a bag of hammers. It is filled with a good Catholic priest, humor sexually repressed. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√© that it is hard to believe that I could predict lines in quotation marks. The cuts have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitals. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and the characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie to have a fun time. Get a cheap beer box and some friends, watch them and laugh.
