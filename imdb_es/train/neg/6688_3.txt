This movie is pretty horrible, but I have interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good portion of the extras in the film are NAU drama students. I was a freshman that year, studying theater, but for some reason I did not get involved with the production. However, I met several people who did and can provide this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this film in which two of the directors, as part of their hazing ritual, have to Run naked towards the forest. They look from behind in the movie, doing just that. The point is that these are not the actors, but two guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "subsequent tricks" will remain anonymous, at least on this website, unless they decide, um, to "reveal" themselves.
