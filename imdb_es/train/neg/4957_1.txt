I can not believe that some people like this. However, they still call themselves Batman fans even going so far as to say that it is better than BTAS. Which is not It should be plagiarism for them to use the Batman name for this shit. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the series is "if you can not beat someone, get a bigger gun to help you". Batman is not all about weapons. He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile, that's all. He can not think of a clever new technology every time he can not beat someone. I do not know where the hell they had the idea of ​​a Batbot. or whatever. They have ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze has gone from being a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell into a state of bewilderment. Catwoman is now a woman of 40 or 50 years old with a silly costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a top hat 50 feet tall. The ventriloquist is now called Scarface and turns the mannequin into the central piece of the character. They even had a silly idea of ​​turning him into a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are Joker and Riddler. They have changed Riddler to a gothic / retro teen freak. and The Joker to an acrobat with dreadlocks. He looks like an impersonator of Bob Marley. They completely and completely ruined Batman, even more than BR! I wish I could meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show to be able to hit them in the head with a metal baseball bat.
