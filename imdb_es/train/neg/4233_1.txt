I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore. The dubbing was worse than any I experienced. It seems that it was filmed with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've seen, but I have to recognize the abundant blood that was not as unpleasant as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and incredible.
