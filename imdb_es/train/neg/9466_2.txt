This movie was physically painful to sit on, maybe because (like many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books: fun, smart, capricious and subversive at the same time. "The cat in the hat" stinks all the interest and the spark of the story, and the performance of Mike Myer as the cat is disconcerting. Why the accent of the Borscht belt, the graceless pattern, the inappropriate jokes, the outfit without charm? I had to go back and reread the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and it's too long. <br /> <br /> All children's films are not expected to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this brand sets a new minimum. How could Mike Myers need the money?
