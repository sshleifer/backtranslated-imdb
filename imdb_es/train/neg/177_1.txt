['If you plan to watch this movie, reconsider. I usually do not post my comments about something I&#39;ve seen on TV, but this was a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Criticizing this movie would take too much time, since there are so many things that are wrong. I&#39;ll just say, please, never watch this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it WILL be a waste of yours. Anyone who has written a positive review of this movie is one of two things; completely inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you&#39;ll regret watching this movie!']
