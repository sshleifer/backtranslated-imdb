This movie was just bad. I love war movies and I can usually get away from most movies and find something that I liked, but this was not one of them. This film lacked substance and intensity. Well, I understand, the Finns did a great fight and that's great, but the story is badly told. You have no real connection to any of the characters and there is no real story to follow. Only one random scene is passed on to another, nothing flows to form the story that is intended to be transmitted. If you want a war movie that will keep you fascinated, and surprisingly without battle scenes, I would suggest "Downfall" (German film of World War II). Or if you prefer a great story and a lot of action, then I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two films will not disappoint you as Winter War will.
