In short, I do not like westerns. And since I never sat through one from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and watch it all the time, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was unbearable as expected. I thought the performance was ridiculous, that the landscape (its standard dessert, horses and cowboys) was boring and that the music and its rhythm wobbled on the verge of pain. However, after mentally encouraging me to keep fighting, after the first 20 minutes, it began to be a little easier for me to endure. Focusing on cinematography, and how John Ford managed to make even the most boring situations (boring in my opinion) look pretty impressive at times, it made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie at the end of it. However, it was good enough for me to sit down to the end, and that in itself impresses me.
