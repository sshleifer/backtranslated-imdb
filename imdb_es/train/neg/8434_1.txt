This film shows more racial hatred against Jews by David Mamet than I found <br /> <br /> in an American movie. The stereotypes are so exaggerated that my ability to keep seeing died. I was very disappointed that Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna called a group of men, sat in a Jewish center in New York cleaning weapons, the heroes prevailed common sense and I stopped. I am deeply concerned about the concept that Jews are not Americans and are "different." I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hate, not a healer of it.
