This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the disguise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually clean by the burial / burning flames of the horse, which of course is still dead, after being tortured to death. This is one of the sickest and thinnest films I've ever had the displeasure to see. When Gene Hackman and James Coburn approach the goal of their DYING animals, we are supposed to admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put the producers and the director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they finish, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
