I may not have the ability to pay more attention, but this is the second movie I have refused to see in its entirety, and I even bought it on DVD due to its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. Rather, the writing was ridiculously amateur, the film went on and felt disconnected, as if someone cut a television series at the height of the film. The Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this film for no less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie that I have refused to watch all the time. The first was "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
