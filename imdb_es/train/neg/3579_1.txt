Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and I decided that he defined absolute zero on the scale of the movie. There was nothing in the movie that could have been made worse than it was. To this day we continue to rate the films, even the very bad ones, because they are much better than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the scripts. for, among other things, "Last Summer" and "The Diary of an Angry Housewife", and told that he had been asked to write a script for Harold Robbins' book "The Lonely Lady". She said she sent a treatment and was rejected because they did not believe she understood the difficulties of a screenwriter in Hollywood. Then he said: "I think they got someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I bet that the first thing she did when she got to heaven was personally thank God for saving her from getting involved in the result.
