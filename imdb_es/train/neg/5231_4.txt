One of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market in the mid-1980s. The routine plot has echoes of "The Magnificent Seven" (believe it or not), the action scenes are handled unconvincingly and the special effects are not exist. YOU COULD DO SOMETHING WORSE ... but the movie is just a waste of time. (* 1/2)
