The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the chair. It's definitely not one of John's best movies. Do not get me wrong, with any movement of John Wayne there are always some good places. And this has its fair share. But in general, the image moves slowly and does not meet the aspirations that could have had. Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The children in the movie were normal, but they could have been better chosen. This would be a good movie for viewers from eight to fifteen years old. <br /> <br /> This would be a good family play to see with your children. Keep in mind that there are a couple of scenes you may want to take a look at before letting young people see you. But most children I know who have seen the movie like it. Maybe it's because they see children their age doing all the adult work.
