The biggest internal joke in the world. The largest and most exclusive internal joke in the world. <br /> <br /> Emulating the cheeky and "all-man" humor of office space, this film drives the appeal of this movie to the ground, making humor so unique. Appropriately appreciated by legal secretaries who write books. The audience is asked to assume the unknown role of a legal secretary, and then empathizes with the insensibly foolish protagonist. <br /> <br /> The whole film focuses on the legal secretary who seeks free time, listens to music and writes a novel while working. These are your goals. You can not imagine the slap in the face that is for the public when (approximately half) they discover that they have had a job that meets all three criteria, but then they leave it! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely eliminate the motivation of the audience to feel empathy or even find entertained a protagonist who previously dismissed what he complained about his lack. <br /> <br /> Apart from that A major obstacle, the internal humor of the legal secretariat fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen. Without these aspects, the public would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it does not need to be explained in detail to the audience, which is fun.
