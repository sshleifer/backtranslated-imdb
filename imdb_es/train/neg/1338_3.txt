I saw changing objectives ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins making the same movie ... they like to play different sports and then they fall in love with the boys ... Talk now about the movie .... first of all, all the little boys and girls do not play with such big goals ... 2. The ball does not play in the dead times ... 3. If the game is at the end, the referee gives some extra hours (one minute or more) ... and the end is so predicted ... I think this film is bad because of the lack of knowledge about football ... if it were made by European producers, it would be better. .. and Also, the actors of the mane are not the best option ... they suffer the lack of authenticity ... OK, they played some seasons in the full house, but that does not make them big stars ... you have to show your talent ... and that's what's missing from the Olsen twins
