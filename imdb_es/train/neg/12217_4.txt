As the low budget indies leave, you will generally find that you get what you pay for, and let me say that I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writer / Director: David R. Williams It brings the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a murdered serial killer. It is not a bad premise, but it runs with a group of low budget errors. The work of the camera tries to be too cutting for its audience, constantly using quick and shaky cuts to cover the fact that they really do not have anything bloody or scary to show us. This is evident from the beginning, as we are presented to the would-be murderer, and soon we realize that (the performance) is the most frightening thing that happens ... After a painfully long sequence of titles, we return to the times modern, but the performance remains the same. "Frightworld" generates a quite unique cinematography by showing landscapes from inside the house of fun, but with an extremely long execution time, it can not save the film because it is below average in hell. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of mediocre nudity, but not much to gore, which is usually the salvation for this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> B-Movies really bad fans can find something of interest here, otherwise, do not spend a lot of money.
