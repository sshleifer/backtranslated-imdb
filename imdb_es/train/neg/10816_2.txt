Oh, just what I needed, another film about the 19th century in England. What looks a lot like normal England, only the vandalizing football stadiums. In this picturesque setting of gentlemen, ladies and other titles chosen at random, Charlotte Gainsbourg walks aimlessly like Jane Eyre, of that novel that nobody has read willingly. in the crib of Mr. Rochester, where he tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty blackboard all the time. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) returns to fall in love with Jane and all that, but there is still the matter of his fruit cake wife who is locked in the attic. Wow, that was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some were carefully extended (they probably rented the set), the film finally comes to an end. Everything seemed really authentic, that's something I suppose. But, again, nah.
