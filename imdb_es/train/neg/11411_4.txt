The story line has been repeated several times; "A breath of life in the retirement home." Several plays, films, novels, stories, poems and news articles have passed the subject until the end, but it is still an excellent platform for character studies. <br /> <br /> If 'Gideon' was created with more enthusiasm, I could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with clich√©s (including the subtitle and summary of the "simple wisdom" of Gideon almost make me laugh at his inefficiency). For the most part, indifferent acting is the last straw of this weak film, but the rest is soft enough to make the lack of focus of the actors almost irrelevant.
