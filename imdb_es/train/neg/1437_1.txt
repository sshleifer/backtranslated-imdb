I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie, but I do not think that having seen it from the beginning would have made any difference. I found the film extremely boring and I was disappointed with the performance. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in outstanding roles, but everyone is disappointed here because of a very weak script. "Kind Salomon Mines" ... the very short part of the film within "mines" was as exciting as watching the paint dry and I doubt even a preschooler would have been delighted to see the warriors fight " The whole movie remembered a series of American television produced at low cost: Give me Indiana Jones any day!
