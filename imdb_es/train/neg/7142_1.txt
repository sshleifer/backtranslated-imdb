This is by far the worst movie I've seen. I was expecting a corny movie, but at least with some great car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so economical that it accelerated them to make it look like the cars "go faster." In one scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from more than 200 to 0 in about 4 seconds, simply by turning in circles. It is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, watch the series fast and furious. They can be a bit corny, but 100 times better than this movie could be. Better yet, just look at Mischief 3000, I think it's the best car movie ever made.
