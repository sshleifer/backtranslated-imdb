This show was ridiculously bad. The writing sucked, the dialogue sucked. The guy Craig played could not get out of a paper bag. Being that it was Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Good music, bad acting, bad writing, everything came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a dramatic / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue around them, which was terrible. I mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that happened in the present were absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> Then, let's review. Everything that happens in the present time stinks. The flashback scenes, only the writing, the dialogue and the performance of Craig, were spoiled. Music ruled however.
