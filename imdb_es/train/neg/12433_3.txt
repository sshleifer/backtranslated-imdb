I like to keep my comments short and simple, but this sums it up pretty well. You can not beat the two originals for several reasons, one of which includes the talent of Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This movie had a terrible direction covered by an even more terrible performance. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> It is painful to sit and look. The story was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists in a thorough search to recover it. Horrible, rent one of the original trailers and have fun! <br /> <br /> The movie was not even put on Christmas like the original. Only at home went from an excellent Christmas family comedy movie to a joke without morals or plot!
