This 'movie' has to be the biggest pile of smoky C * ^ p I've seen <br /> <br />, what else can I say that BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to keep this 'movie' and I pray that they will NEVER talk about making a sequel. If you are thinking about seeing this, you should know that the plot is that two garbage men are dragged to save the earth. Movies like Men in Black have been smashed and rebuilt to make this 'Comedy', but they have failed TOTALLY. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
