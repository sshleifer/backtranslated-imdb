I bought this movie in a boot sale, so I did not expect it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I thought it would still be nice to watch. However, it was shown that it was not entirely pleasant, but that the performance and the film in general were simulable, such as the ways in which the "invisible murderer" murders his victims and how all the murdered people are blond youngsters. woman. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this because of the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women in danger, most are killed. 2) One survives by crawling in the dark while being pursued by the murderer. 3) Surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> By using three simple points, I've saved you two extra hours by summarizing this poor excuse of a horror movie, so now you're lucky enough not to have to see it.
