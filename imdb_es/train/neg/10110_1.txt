This movie was, by far, the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. It was badly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It seemed like a movie that my friends and I could have made together. The case in which the film entered is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the box. It seems that the director or makeup artist just put the black eyeliner under someone's eyes and called them zombie. The credits at the beginning of the film occupy almost 20 minutes of the film. That seeing the credits was the best part of the movie. Honestly, this was a horrible movie and I could not believe how bad it was put together. The scenes jumped from one thing to the other and, sometimes, one said "what's going on?" The audio was horrible and the action shots looked like a joke from a couple of teenagers making a fake-fight scene. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this movie, I would advise you to at least look at the trailer. It's because it shows how horrible it really is. I wish I had seen it before renting it.
