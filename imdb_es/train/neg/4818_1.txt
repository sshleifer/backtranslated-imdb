I was around 7 years old when this song from a movie premiered. In the United Kingdom it was announced on television in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were a highly successful film. Actually, it was the first movie I saw in a movie theater and they delayed me for many years. The following week I was invited to go see the new movie "Star Wars" and I rejected it. To this day I've never seen him, in protest of having to see Sasquatch. Seriously, even at the age of 7 I realized that I was seeing garbage. It's so bad, it's almost incredible. Nonsense nonsense that NEVER should have come to the movies. However, I had fun reading all these years after the director never directed again, as well as I do. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
