I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps in a strange way (since I heard that the movie is missing a section), and the characters appear and disappear with sudden irritation. Some of the intertitles are too explanatory (eg, "Why, you are not a child anymore!") Go back to the picture for a long, slow time, "you are a woman!", Yes, we have it. first time) but there are some conversation sequences that ask for explanations that never appear. (Listen to the argument of Luigi and his blonde girlfriend, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was difficult to observe. For writer's credit, this problem was treated as a problem, and a May-to-December match does not present itself as the inevitability of the right and good of some Mary Pickford films (for example, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). ). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think it has been better directed in the past; He did it in excess several times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the clown sequences, and I was very impressed by the tricks. Loretta Young was charming, but surprisingly young. The movie has its moments, but so far, it's my least favorite Chaney picture.
