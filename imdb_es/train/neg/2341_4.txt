Well ... it seems that until now, only the fans of Barman have commented on this film, it is time for a counterpoint. Beware, this article is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (mostly non-Belgian): Tom Barman, director of this film, is the leader of dEUS, one of the best known rock bands of the late 90s here in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to national fame. Then, the egos began to hurt and the band basically collapsed, with Barman and a couple of people remaining to continue making albums under the dick-monicker. As always in these cases, the dEUS after the break was much more discreet and less interesting than the original. They tried to obtain an international breakthrough with their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, presenting a very diluted form of their previous style of composition. They did not achieve it at all. However, the egos were still quite large, it seems: big enough for Barman to consider himself as an artist enough to try movies. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this kind of thing is a VERY important mistake, and this movie does not make the exception. And Barman clearly was by * art * in this, another big mistake. On the one hand, he is a musician, not a film director. On the other hand, dEUS at its best was fun and provoked music, but never anything like what I would consider * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> So, what is this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a group of completely disinterested people, doing equally disinterested things along a totally uninterested Friday in Antwerp, as more disinterested things happen to them in the act of not being interesting. The characters are shallow, the plot is totally useless and the film simply has no other redeeming quality to compensate for these deficiencies. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single laugh of 5 seconds (not very loud). Mood? The movie just does not seem to show any emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) the idea of ​​the "man of the wind", which inspires the name of the film, is as fascinating as a banana and pepper pizza, not very, and has been done a thousand times before (everyone remembers Johny Destiny - One of the worst appearances of Tarantino in the movie to date (* END MINOR SPOILER *) .And well, it's * artistic *, so do not expect any kind of real action to make up for all of the above. , except for the few smiles, I got bored with my shorts. <br /> <br /> So, what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it has some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately. First, it makes the film look like nothing more than a commercial for the CD Secondly, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and the lack of emotional content in the film behind the quality of the content of the films. songs, that just does not work. it makes the movie look like nothing more than an illustration of the songs. And, unfortunately, it is the contribution of Barmans to the soundtrack that receives the most attention, although it is the weakest part of the entire soundtrack as far as I am concerned. In short, it's just to show that Barman knows more about music than about movies. Working with the camera is also good, although it is not something that makes you scream with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this movie that kept me looking was the eye factor. Since my origin in Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of "guess the location" game. However, I would hardly consider this as a quality. <br /> <br /> In short, another lost opportunity for the flamenco film. I keep noticing that lately, the best Belgian films have come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because, at least, they have something to tell and they manage to say it as sharply as emotionally (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Maybe Flemish art filmmakers should also try.
