The wealthy widower Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and murders them. The stripper in black boots Erika Blanc (as Susie) moves away, temporarily. Mr. Steffen is persecuted by his wife "Evelyn", who died in childbirth. As a therapy, he decides to get married again, after meeting the pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). By the end of the movie, they will have had to dig a few more tombs. "The night that Evelyn came out of the grave" is a great title, at least. <br /> <br /> ** The note that Evelyn usc√¨ dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
