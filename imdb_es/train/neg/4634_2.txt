Obviously she has a bit of talent attached, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a waste of lugubrious time, presenting each character as someone to hate and exploit so that someone can make a film of an "interesting" story. Well, I hope you got it out of your systems. unfortunately for the audience, there is no perception, sensitivity, context and, in reality, there is no humanity. Everything would be fine, except that he has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story he is trying to tell. Bad things happen, you sit and you see, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. This means that the director and the screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard somewhere, so they simply throw them on the screen and hope that the "true" nature of the story makes the audience feel something without them filmmakers have to do nothing. from work. I hope you have had a great time making this movie. It stinks on the ice.
