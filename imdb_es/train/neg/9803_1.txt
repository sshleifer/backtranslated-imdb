The Power Rangers are definitely the worst TV show and a completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely horrible TV show. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, wearing spandex outfits of various colors that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this program should feel ashamed of themselves, since there is no redemptive value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's children should try to see better shows like Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
