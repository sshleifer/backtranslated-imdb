Wow ... pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> Turning a thriller / suspense / horror into comedy. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I never laughed so much about a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that developed in an insane way, whether they were not written in depth or with too much depth. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an absolutely written horror movie with a stupid dialogue, a disorderly plot, useless scenes, characters wasted, bad sound and bad development in general, then this is the one to see. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay focused on the classic "food processor" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing, and sitting through it throughout the duration makes you stupid, daring or brave.
