['What was I thinking? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays a policeman in the future who joins a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. The direct rarity to the tape is shameful and ridiculous, a high concept in search of itself. Apparently this was a work of love for his writer and director, Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); Unfortunately, the final results are anemic, to be charitable. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen can often elicit good will and laughter, no matter how poor the script is, but here he is drowning and you can see the unfortunate results. NO STARS OF ****']
