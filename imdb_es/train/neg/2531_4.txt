The title song for this movie ........... is the best free-spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in 1978-79, when I subscribed to cable for the first time. In 1979, cable began to become commonplace in homes. (or at least when it was becoming common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This could be the first movie I saw on the paid channel called "The Movie Channel", which was called "The Star Channel" at the time, they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" to early 80's. I received a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the films that was in a large rotation on that network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie at the time, and thinking that it was a typical teen movie (in the same vein as other films for medium-budget teenagers) ... those in which the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this movie existed until recently I saw it again after not having seen it. decades ago (I found a copy on DVD for sale in a cheap wastebasket) I recognized it and bought it for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> It seems I remembered that this movie was much better than it was (is). However, seeing him back then was a different experience than seeing him now (more than 30 years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to see the children enrolled in rock n roll music, smoking grass and having sex in the back. a luxury van (often all at the same time). This is what should be a good party movie for teenagers. <br /> <br /> There is no other plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his great rival, the girlfriend of good looks ... he knocks down all the money from the college savings to buy a Dodge Van (with carpeted walls, a ceiling with mirrors and a water bed) to get his attention, and eventually he will have sex with her. But his archrival discovers him and comes to look for him (so that the two can resolve their differences by dragging their vans) ... he and his archrival end up destroying his two trucks, and instead of stealing his girlfriend, who rivals the arch, he wins the heart of a preppy girl (less attractive) with which half / ass goes through most of the movie and decides that she is happier / better and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has its funny moments. But seeing this film more than 30 years later, it becomes more of a trip down the path of memory. Because I can still remember the pizza lounges, the pinball game rooms, it also brought back memories of walking around a small town while we smoked marijuana, like we were screaming at pretty girls and hoping to get laid (sometimes I was lucky and I got something decent). looking for a girl to share a link with me and we screwed in the back seat shifts, I also remember many of the songs in this movement (when they were new) ... this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that. It was in those aspects (I recovered many memories) <br /> <br /> the only thing that is described in this film that, honestly, I can not remember is ... I never remember a time when full-size vans were as popular as this movie he describes them as if they were. I remember that was very good, and not the young people who are out there wanting to have a truck. Instead, I remember the young people in the 70s (auto included) who want a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van. This movie makes it seem that the vans were the most popular element on the march and that each young man wanted one (which was not true at that time)
