Of Jess Franco's three titles to find his way onto DPP's list of official unpleasant videos (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least worthy of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle in the fanned jungle very little for a little inept gore, a scene of gratuitous violation and a lot of nakedness. <br /> <br /> The beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a wild tribe that worships the "god of the devil" "that hides in the jungle (a big native, naked and with bulging eyes who likes to eat the hearts of Nubile women sacrifices). <br /> <br /> Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his veteran friend from Vietnam travel to the island, but encounter problems when the bad guys try a double cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the natives of the island, who offer it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco runs his usual awkward style and carries this ridiculous effort with his usual frightening brands: gorillas, dark cinematography, fast approaches, numerous crotch shots, out of focus images, frightening sound effects and punched editions. The result is a disaster that is a real struggle to sit from start to finish (it took me a couple of sessions to finish the thing), and even the sight of the delicious Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough to make me review this film to hastily.
