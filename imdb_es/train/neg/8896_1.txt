Last night I saw Brigadoon on television (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and I've been watching movies since I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon is alone, like the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the customers who had the misfortune to see them. It is to be expected that the stars of this film have been hidden thick enough to protect them from the shame they must have suffered when watching this movie. The owners of this gut must perform a great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
