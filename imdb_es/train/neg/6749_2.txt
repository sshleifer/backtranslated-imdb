This mess is so bad that it does not even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted in this movie. She is not even the villain. The rest of the actors resemble the aspiring porn and the argument is so scanty that I will not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and jump to the final credits to listen to the next band TwoMarlowe play "Better Than Sex" is the total song of the Disco 80s candy. Pleasant tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. Much more entertaining than "Bleed". Put it this way, when you have the equipment to copy videos, but you decide to just record the song at the end of the movie, you have a really "BAD" movie.
