I rarely move to make a comment online about a movie. But I can not understand how this was done. Who did it? How could they have thought they were capable of making a movie? Did they take a weekend course at a film school, got a big check from Dad and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to participate? Or was it by chance that an old friend of the family / distant relationship did this out of pure and strange kindness? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he is completely ashamed to be there, muttering his lines and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP must have been in charge of Neighbors, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction and the editing were abysmal, and frankly the apathy that overwhelms me at this moment means that I can not bother doing it . I spend more of my life thinking about this movie.
