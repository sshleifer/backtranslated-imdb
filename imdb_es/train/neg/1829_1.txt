Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben anymore. How this man can make movies still surpasses me. I can not understand how this happens if I acted at work in the same way that I act in a movie that I am fired and I am the owner of the company ... I would have to say goodbye myself. GOD! This movie was just a simple, smoky, stinky pile of OOP, that needs to be vaporized if that were possible. Something else I have to say that the guideline on 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying some things about a movie? I will never understand why the sites will require a short novel written when, sometimes, all that is needed is a brief comment.
