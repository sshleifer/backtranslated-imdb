Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this movie was not about anything, or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another police movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some aspects. city, all supported in secret by the business of the spine and in the city, under the watchful eye of a hot-shot politician. The all-powerful organization and above the law is called FRAT and guess what? They have a crazy cop who shoots and hits at will - suspects, girlfriends, whatever. The police of FRAT are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are discovered by a young and talented journalist (!!!). An hour later, after a series of incredibly poor shooting scenes and more lines of stereotypes, everything ends happily and we receive the last line: you can not beat the system. Bah! I do not see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes in total!
