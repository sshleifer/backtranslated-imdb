** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The topless heroine owner rescues another beautiful baby and her father (an eccentric teacher whose helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next) from a moth eaten , shop mummy ten cents and nasty Nazis for - what else? - Build a Fourth Reich. Misty's disguise, like that of some other men, becomes scarcer as the movie progresses. The last part of the film is dedicated to prolonged lesbian action; This recording becomes really boring, really fast, which says more about the creatures behind the camera than the curvy creatures that are in front of it. MISTY gets her nominal plot of the road first and fast, then pays undivided attention to nudity and soft sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this work of wonder had been launched four decades ago, I would have played for years on 42nd Street, along with WHAM BAM, THANKS, SPACE and BETTER KISS. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to the home video. Take yours, quick, before it runs out.
