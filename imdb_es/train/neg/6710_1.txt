I have seen more than 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. It's a shame they had to associate this garbage with the 1963 Angels song, "My Boyfriend's Back." If you have to choose between watching this movie and the painful dental work, I would suggest the dental work.
