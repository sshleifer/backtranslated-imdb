This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I've seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite scams. Face it, people who have already mastered silly humor. Do something new for once. All these new comedies are just horrible. And coming out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role yet. I hope he can recover from this horrible movie. And the character of Will Arnetts is simply bad. Hey Will, did you read the script? The plot is truly the worst written. Now tell me if this is weird. (This is the movie) Rod Kimble's stepfather, Frank, is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod is planning this big leap to raise money for Frank. Just so Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manhood. Yes, that's the movie, you tell me, you would spend $ 7.00 to see that garbage! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just horrible <br /> <br /> -adam
