Based on one of Gabriel MÃ¡rquez's books and it could be brilliant literature, this film adaptation really sucks, since it is more like fighting against sleep instead of enjoying some cinematic delights. The story is about an elderly couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and in which the main character is a rooster who, hopefully, will one day bring money for a next cockfight. I'm not in the mood to spill more words in this useless and pretentious piece, only maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sit 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? No thanks.....
