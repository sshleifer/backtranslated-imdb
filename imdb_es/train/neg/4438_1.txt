I borrowed this movie from the library and I think it could be a delight. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She's a pretty girl, but in this movie, she's not alluring, but I'll have to witness her uncomfortable attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It is so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so pretentious, and lacks the humorous fact that makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Totally failed.
