"I went to the movies, to see 'Beat Street' / it was not bad, it was a bit 'clean' / 'Krush Groove' was a movie that did not matter to me / but when it came to 'Rappin', I drew the line." Notify your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> That's just a small sample of the rupa style of stupa-fly on display in this movie waste and location permissions. This movie is seriously crazy (that's 80s-speak for just f * cking horrible). As a master of ceremonies, Mario Van Peebles is an actor's hell. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a great bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Any movie that calls itself "Rappin '" should be delivered to the highest level of that genre at the time. So, why did the 6-year-olds roll down the aisles, even in those days when the standards were so low to "Webster"? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will play it with a 10-foot string of gold rope. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "ecstasy" is definitely poetry along with this piece of Dr. Suess on the hood. So do not be a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
