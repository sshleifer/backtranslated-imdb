It's 1978, and yes, obviously, there are too many black players on the teams! The fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, but less happy that there are so many black players on the field! This fact for the TV movie Super Bowl is visible. It's not much more, but it's really amazing the cast of talented actors who make an appearance (for the time being), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any kindness that Selleck brings to the screen is quickly overtaken by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story about Super Bowl betting. PJ Jackson is accused by "New York" (Mafia reading) for ensuring that the game ends in his favor, in this case a bet of $ 10,000,000. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a bit of control when buying some people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspected Lainie, takes charge. For a while, the mystery of the murders is not known with certainty, but it is revealed quite clearly in the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's visible. The acting is decent, and the filming is fine. At least there was no typical persecution of the 70s (they have their place, simply not here). Just keep an open mind about the stereotypes of the past and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
