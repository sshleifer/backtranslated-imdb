This movie shows a clip of the mutilation of live animals of an animal that is cut by a machete and that rip off the skin. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I'm watching movies based on the fact that what I'm seeing is not really happening on the screen. These live animal clips are not meant to be recorded in movies, they are designed to show people belonging to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans do to make other species. <br /> <br /> This must be prohibited and destroyed. I've also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate and get this movie out of the market! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
