- A Mexican priest becomes a fighter to save an orphanage or something. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was wrestling without WWF and I thought it could be fun. It was not unbearable to see him. Embarrassing. Any opportunity for comedy is wasted mercilessly. <br /> <br /> I admit that I do not like Jack Black anyway. After this, I have been tormenting my brain to think of a good role that it has played. The only thing I can think of is where was o.k. It was as a necessary complement to the character of John Cusack in "High Fidelity". Jack Black is one of those tremendously implacable and disoriented guys who have nothing (like the fat little Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being too stupid is not the same as being funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even slapstick. It's just irritating. It's not even stupid, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if this is something to go through, I will not rush to look for it on DVD.
