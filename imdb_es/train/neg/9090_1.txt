A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you expected an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply an anti-Zionist, there is nothing wrong with defending the destruction of a country, right?) Or uncritically in support of Palestinian objectives (for example, mass murder, destruction of Israel), this is the documentary for you. It should be an entertaining night on university campuses across the United Kingdom and the United States. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be scandalized by the large amount of lies presented in this video. I just hope that those who are not really aware of the situation will not be corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth.
