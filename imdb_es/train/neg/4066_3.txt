In director Eric Stanze's 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men are subjected to torture by a woman who has all been sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat her own shit, before being killed. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first man's body. But it is the third man who receives the worst: he has to see Emily Haack, naked and tattooed, undressing and masturbating with the handle of a broom (oh, she also puts the handle in her behind!). <Br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, we too (we can watch her masturbate, that is, not get a broom to take care of our buttocks!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a hard viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, who is obviously under the mistaken idea that she has the body of a goddess ( in opposition to that of a roadie for Metallica) he constantly gets money for the camera. It is not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the nonstop nudity of an inked Haack, viewers can also see the terrible direction of Stanze (who thinks the interminable shots of tombstones and trees). it is something entertaining), some act very badly and the penis of a fat man. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. That is a point for the disordered attack of the ax (which, being a gore-hound, I really enjoyed); a point for the bit in which the fat man puts his face in a chocolate mousse disguised as feces (hilarious); and a point for the impudence that suggests that this film could be in some way a sequel to Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave.
