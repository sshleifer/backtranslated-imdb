Have you heard about a Taiwanese horror movie? Or some Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This was really boring, although it has black magic that includes bodies of withered babies and people that explode from the inside with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading the thoughts of other people, I expected some violence. And gore, but there's not much at all. Some chups of blood and other boring things, if you're expecting graphic gore or some frightening effect, you'll be disappointed. They clearly did not use the eel explosion and other things at their maximum power. <br /> <br /> Almost nothing good about this movie; a single character that was not completely bland and a few spells of black magic, like that of the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (it's not really terrifying). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've seen in my life.
