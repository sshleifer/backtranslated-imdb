Disappointing movie The performance of the actors is weak. The sets are fine, they could have been better. History is also weak. The battle sequences are horrible. The sounds and quality of the movie are garbage. The history of the Kazakhs was very bad. This film should have included more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And it should also have been in the Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hern√°ndez are Hispanic origins. I do not understand it Since when Hispanics play Turkish-Mongolian. This movie is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. The director of Czekh is excused, since he is not of nomadic origin, he can not know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
