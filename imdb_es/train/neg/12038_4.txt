Is there anything at all in this movie? There are only strange and strange scenes in which I did not know what the hell was going on, so that does not count. This movie is so boring that it hurts, and this comes from a person who likes it when movies try to make movies. Confused? Well, I was after seeing this shit. What was Donald Sutherland, because he missed it with this completely. And what about the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the movie. You can put anyone to sleep! 4/10
