For the most part, this movie feels like an effort "made for TV". The direction is heavy-handed, the performance (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overloaded and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, offers her lines as if she were cold when reading them from a reference card. Only one thing makes it worthwhile to watch this movie, and that is once Gage returns from the "Semetario". There is something disturbing about watching a young child murder someone, and this movie may be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely chilling. This movie only does one thing well, but it makes that thing come out of the park. It's worth seeing only for the last 10 minutes or so.
