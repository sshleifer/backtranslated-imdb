A doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of a transplant is secretly experiencing the corpses of the hospital with different successes. His best final chance is when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket while rescuing her from a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this premise I thought I had found it. It has everything bad movie hunters are looking for: chest and brain surgery with surgeons leaving with pristine white coats, unique camera angles (I always love seeing the wheels of cars on the passenger's rear wheels), music from cheesy clarinet stripper and one of the longest scenes of death in the history of cinema. But, unfortunately, these bad times that are good can not overcome the too bad stretches that stink. <br /> <br /> Jan at the Pan bothered me, with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper, something less than evil laughter, and the fact that they kept her alive with some Colombian homemade coffee and 2 DD batteries . <br /> <br /> I could not even entertain myself with Dr. Bill's horrible exaggeration and morals. . Usually, this type of ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion, in this case I got bored. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the 1960 version of "body shopping" and I even found my head off during that time. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on this, there are better bad movies to entertain your bad sense of humor.
