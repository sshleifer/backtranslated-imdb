This is the first movie of The Horrorfest I've seen and after I almost believe that I do not need to see any of the others. They told me it was a "horror movie for thinking men" and I have to say that if this was supposed to make me think I was going to think about what the blood-spattered films would look like in the collection. Do not get me wrong, even the gore in this movie is worth sitting on. <br /> <br /> The plot is very shattered with too much art for art. The effects of the camera and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least. Several characters and scenes seem to have no value at the end when they begin to reveal some of the "The Hamiltons" hooks. I realized who Lenny was in about half an hour when I discovered the movie. I was so visually low and overwhelmed and confused by Lenny's revelation that I felt completely cheated. I expected what I got but they could have gone much further, in fact, all the gore falls completely flat. With films like "Hostel" and "Saw", it is necessary that you come a little better for a movie that is "considered graphic or too disturbing for the general public".
