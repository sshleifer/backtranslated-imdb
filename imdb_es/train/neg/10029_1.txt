I had no idea what the movie was about before I saw it because Tashan only had trailers while promoting it. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said "it's the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 and 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son, Ibrahim, makes his debut in the film by playing it like a child in his flashback. " <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I understood that there was not a suitable trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was extremely silly and even a 10 year old can have a better story. There was almost no action and the camera shook in all possible angles and it is difficult to realize who is killing whom. Also the action was silly and unrealistic, for example. 1 man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> While I was watching Tashan, he reminded me of 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: the terrible English of Anil Kapoor as Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even so funny. <br /> <I also heard that the budget is 40 million rupees, which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2, there is absolutely no chance that you like Tashan. The race was hot on his heels and that's a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya and both songs are recorded in Greece in good places, but what is the use of this in a junk movie? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible Englishman could not save this bewilderment.
