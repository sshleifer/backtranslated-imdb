Do not listen to the deceitful title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well known for emphasizing sex and nudity about real fears in their horror films, but this is too much here. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a sleazy sex scene and the title character is going crazy and brutally killing his partner. Have fun the first few times, but one hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. She is not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The movie can not even decide its tone, since the first ten minutes (a flashback) are a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I expected a trash classic after these) to a rather poor study of the woman who was abused and tortured repeatedly to a thriller of revenge. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. If it is okay. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some entertaining aspects of production. The title of werewolf woman is a spectator and there are some nice effects and nude scenes. However, these become quite monotonous quickly. In addition, the doubled dialogue is quite hilarious in the manner of a camp, especially the most active doctor in the world (baby at work). Unfortunately, the movie becomes quite irritating quickly. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a shame, because when I read a description I felt that the film had real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is too long, slow, and a little too useless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)
