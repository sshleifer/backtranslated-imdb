All the ingredients of cult movies from low-brow films. Topless girls (and bottomless), Kung Fu cooks, slave traders, evil Germans with mustaches, Cameron Mitchell and zombies wielding swords. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the breasts of Camille Keaton, which is the best known. The exhibition takes place in the classic of the feminist exploitation I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention the hooters of the jewel Shepard, who play a prostitute in the recent movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Much blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts between topless dancers in a bar, in a whores, and on a boat full of martial artists heading to a zombie island where bad artists martial are going to die or something like that. <br /> <br /> Tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently, as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the owner of the boat. <br /> <br /> Then a disaster happens when their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where the monks but sacrifice the young women to the dead martial artists to give them back their lives. <br /> <br /> Just when you thought you had everything, there are piranhas in the water. Yum Yum A big and fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Just what you need for your next zombie festival.
