Gadar is an example of one of the most overrated films in Bollywood. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make films related to the period, gives a garbage movie. The songs were boring and it's not the kind of song you want to hear in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making stupid movies, where she hits 100 bad guys on her own. He even kicks a metal prison door (Indian) and kicks a car moving far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of shameful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know it. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same kind of role. A guy who claims to be fighting for the piece of his country, using violence. Amisha Patel is undoubtedly sexy with an incredible body that I would love to debone. But even she could not stop the movie from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like he usually does, in this movie he does not. Maybe because she was playing a Muslim, but she does not behave like one of the movies. In general, this is a bad show, I'm sure it will attract some people who love to see how the Bollywood actor hits 100 men. Give me a break.
