This really should deserve an "O" rating, or even a negative rating of ten. I watched this program for years, and the show jumped to the shark in series 7. This episode, however, is proof that the program has jumped the shark. His writing is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even worthy of garbage like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It's quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun: Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy, The Count of Monte Cristo: all the "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there are such ridiculous things as in "this is the worst I've seen". And, in fact, this is the worst Stargate episode I've seen. It is absolutely terrible, and this comes from someone with a stellar portal in his basement. <br /> <br /> It makes me want to sell all my Stargate accessories, very seriously.
