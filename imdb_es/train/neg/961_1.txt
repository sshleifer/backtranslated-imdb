Silly, simplistic and brief, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN OF NOW) is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short story (just over sixty minutes) is not as inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a scam by Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DAD (his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns) introduced in a contemporary environment. In QUICK & DEAD, the character of Sharon Stone seeks revenge against the evil sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when he was no more than a hedgehog, put in his hands the fate of his father (a brief cameo by Gary Sinise); She accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by agile Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the evil Mr. Tojo (played with a minimalist appeal of Shingo Tsurumi), who, when he was nothing more than a hedgehog, put the fate of his father in his hands; she let her foot slide off the clutch, and my father was drawn and separated by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the configurations, is the fact that Tojo sadistically paralyzes Saki with ?? Well, I will not ruin it for you in case you decide to see it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki? A pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's 'Nameless Man'? walks in the city? Basically, there's a car workshop and a tavern next to a US military base, so I guess that's enough for a city. Corrupted by Tojo, the lord of the local crime with a ridiculously high price in his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing his true self as a bounty hunter, Saki confronts gunmen in gunfights whose choreography shows more than a fleeting similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the movie, Saki has endured her many tortures at the hands of the bad guys, but she is up to the task. on your knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending? and defeat all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where the rocket launcher is from. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The image quality is average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality in several sequences, but in general, this is not a bad transfer. The quality of the sound leaves a little to the imagination sometimes, but, again, it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> Rather, it's a bad movie.
