Contrary to another critic, I think this is well written, especially the more fictional it is, because it would require a greater imagination; and he acted well, because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these well-made monologues of more than twelve minutes. But those solemn and pious memories do not entertain me. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. We all have problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten stories and not very atypical problems, which exemplify how someone's life (or part of it) is the forage for the cinema. On the other hand, I also think badly about TV reality shows. So, if that's your bag, you might like this. It's the kind of thing they would do for a good gossip by phone and / or internet; but absolutely without action other than verbal. And, although each of the speakers is female, I'm going to leave the genre out of this.
