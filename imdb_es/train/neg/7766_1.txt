<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes of this series made for television that spans the many adventures of the sea legend, the human infallibility of Horatio Hornblower ruins any possibility of suspense. As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves all situations. Each and every intelligent solution comes inevitably from the mouth of Horatio Hornblower. Immensely superior, Hornblower's main problem in this series of films seems to be to tolerate the many characters full of errors above and below him in the chain of command. A perfect being does to tell boring stories. Our hero is so superior, that even those who try to help him are unable to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control each of his movements. <br /> <br /> What is the point of telling a story about any one person who can not do evil and will repeatedly win everything at all times? What is the point of seeing such a story?
