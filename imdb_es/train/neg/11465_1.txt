Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst pictures I really paid money to see: the kind of movie you choose out of desperation in the movie theater of the mall during the Christmas holidays, when you've missed the start times for something good but you're still dead. To see a movie! And that's exactly how I came to see this stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> In the distance of most of the three decades, I can still smell the rotten fish that makes up this story. The incredible plot, that a killer whale holds a grudge against an individual that is not from the sea, is ridiculous. And that's it, except for a completely misplaced "love theme" that is played at the end of a movie without a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is charming (on a two-dimensional paper), but Richard Harris just scratches the stage. It was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not "Jaws". Fortunately, I have forgotten most of the time and, when I find it on television, I move immediately. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See the current t.v A commercial that shows a husband and wife watching whales ("Orca - I love Orca ..."), at least it ends in sixty seconds. This movie represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never return.
