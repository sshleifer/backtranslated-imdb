It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it happened with another classic of the 80 Wargames ... :( Why, oh, why, oh, you will never learn Hollywood? They can not be remade ... They stink ... We all hate them ...! <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, rent it / buy it now ... !! The hardware may seem old-fashioned, the special effects are not a new millennium, but it still outweighs this garbage ... <br /> <br /> For those of us who live in the 80s when piracy was sexy, the Internet was somewhat mysterious and their discs had a variety of 8 "floppy, now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie as a Thermonuclear War! <br /> <br /> It has never seemed like "a good game of chess" the best option ...
