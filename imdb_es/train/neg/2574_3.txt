I know that movies do not necessarily have to reflect reality, but it made me nervous. Perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mom" thing has been done too many times before (and it usually gets better) and much of the rest of the plot is also unlikely. The performance was not horrible, but it was not at all delirious. <br /> <br /> A highlight: I'm a big fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH regulator, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can ignore the fake psychoanalytic part of it, in the same way that a person should suspend reality / judgment when watching many movies, then this movie can be tolerable . If you have nothing better to do and pretty low standards. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I spent my time watching it.
