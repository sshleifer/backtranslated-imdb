Horrible performance, horrible cast and cheap props. It would have been much better if it had been established as an action parody movie. What a waste. From the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" Nominating it "Action Movie" would have improved it. (Contributing to the parody effect). The police, who looked like a player of 60 years, the blonde always had the same boring blank look at all times. Towards the end of the film, he and she are working together to get rid of the bad guys and every time they exchange words, they feel like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
