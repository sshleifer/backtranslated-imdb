This movie just followed the storyline of the movie. All the fascinating points in the book did not even exist in the movie. They ended up turning it into a story of "Disney movie" in love "with Meg" between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that it should have been Hillary Duff playing the role, or one of her tastes. This movie was no more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney could get away with such a cheap and basic interpretation. If you have ever read the book, I think you would agree that it could easily become an equivalency film of "The Lord of the Rings." This movie should never have been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Badly done
