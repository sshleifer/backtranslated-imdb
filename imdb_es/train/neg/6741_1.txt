Seriously, I love romantic comedies and they'll let me catch Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It does not make any sense! And I'm not even talking about the voluntary suspension of disbelief of not making sense. Why does your family live in England? Or, at least, why does not he have a British accent? She is sure she is comfortable with her father and he, surprisingly, forgives her that she has not been around for the past two years. (On that subject, nobody makes a great deal about his absence for so long). And what about the ridiculous costumes at the bachelorette party? I will not even go into the fact that the escort for which he paid falls in love with her, which could have been overcome with a better movie making. I'm just saying that the characters, the stage and the plot are not developed enough to make a story even a bit cohesive. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's systematic use of the less flattering angles in Deborah Messing's nose. I would have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace watching, I have not realized how incredibly strange your nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This movie, like my other less favorite film, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This allows me to easily vote as one of the worst movies I've wasted my time. I'm glad that a friend lent me his DVD, so all I wasted was time. If there was a way to do this ZERO star review, I would.
