SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams' life, I mean it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think the Secret Service members are everyday people, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now his motivations are clear, well known. But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you, because the old but used turns, the average performance, are just things in this movie, just to keep you waiting for the end. Clark Johnson as the director of SWAT I did a much better job like this one, and I still wonder how the producers (for example, Michael Douglas) left this movie for the theaters.
