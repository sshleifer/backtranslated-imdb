At first, I was convinced that this was a movie made for television that was not worthy of being the prime time. But after a few minutes of astonishment, I realized that there was at least a comic value in the acrobatics and the c-movie performance. This movie would have got a 1 if my wife and I had not laughed so much when we saw her with astonishment that the actors could be sincere. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with an even worse performance. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, and not Jim, after all the hugs and good wishes. A little rum and cokes will definitely help you get off more easily.
