I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all of which are in this story! Add Gary Cooper to the mix as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes later, bored to death. The character of Jean Arthur was somewhat annoying and James Ellison did not look or act like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was not at his best either, it sounded too much wood. This was several years before he reached his best moment as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, your targets of the west shot. Direct the step and look at another oater because most of them were much better than this one.
