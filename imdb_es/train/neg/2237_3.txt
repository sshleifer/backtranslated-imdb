I received this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that probably will continue ...) Even the cover of the DVD seems cheap, like the whole movie. Shots and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple argument, made me laugh, until my stomach hurts! With very few financial resources, I must admit that it looked quite professional. Seen as a movie, it was one of 13 in a dozen aspiring gangsta films that no one is waiting for. So: if you're tired and you want to laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
