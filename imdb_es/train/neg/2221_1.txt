I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just does not hold up. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene in which Michael kills his sister, Judith, with her Halloween mask. The most surprising moment of the whole movie is when his parents take off their mask to see their son killing his daughter. The movie goes downhill from there and does not continue until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, the audience has lost all interest in the story. There is hardly any development of characters, and people always go crazy over the fact that Laurie is such an exceptional heroine, when in reality there is not much for her. I regret not agreeing with everyone who is terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie, go see The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert has given him four stars, because there is no way that this film could deserve such a high rating.
