Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... "protector" of the treasure, whatever it may be) who descends from a long list of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of an enormous treasure that our Founding Fathers, most if not all Freemasons, had decided to hide because they simply did not want to finance their Independence so badly. <br /> <br /> The first clue turns out to be on a lost ship long ago hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), the movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and a pair of faceless footmen, enter the cargo hold of the ship. Immediately they poured tons of gunpowder all over the floor, not that this is significant in any way. Finally, they find the clue (a skeleton is floating above it) and it turns out to be a pipe with writing ... in it. A kind of Do not ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> It's a riddle and, despite the fact that his expedition is clearly offended by not finding the real treasure, Gates gropes about the meaning of the riddle. in this frozen cargo hold, while the crew simply stands with their mouths open. Well then. Someone should have been a bit vocal in his disappointment of reaching the damned Arctic and not finding anything interesting, but they stay there when Gates enters his own world, solving the riddle. <br /> <br /> The next clue turns out to be in the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is dismayed. Several characters deliver an obvious grid exposure (get used to it). All this leads Ian's lackey to throw a gun at Gates, and the gunpowder is fired in a huge explosion. (Oh, that's why they spilled all the gunpowder!) Ian and his henchmen escape, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in sub-zero temperatures to an Inuit village to stop them. <br /> <br /> To stop them, Gates concludes that after testing the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley must steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates with an unbearable detail why they can not steal the Declaration, because it is very protected with metal eyes and laser and high-tech security, blah, blah. Gates then tells Riley that there is an opportunity to steal it from the Preservation Room. Does Riley know what the Preservation Room is, asks Gates? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; that's the real line Bartha does not give it as a joke either. So Riley does all this research about the Library of Congress and the Archives and the water and sewage, but he does not know what the Preservation Room is. This indicates to a large extent what level this script is at. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short film, Gates actually competes with the D of I, in a ridiculous theft that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they represent the technology of computer monitors in movies, full of graphics and unlikely and impractical sources). Abigail Chase ends up labeling herself for convenience, and as an obvious angle of "love interest". In a moment, all three, fleeing from the law, discuss all their plans aloud in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father. , played by a skeptic Jon Voight, brings the good guys and bad guys alike to a huge Indiana Jones fun house located below New York City. It's strange that the subway builders have never found this. Gates and Senior Gates took Ian on a wild goose hunt. Ian thinks they're stuck in a dead end and leaves them there. However, after they leave, Riley asks how they are going to get out. Doors ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... press a button and a door opens. No I'm serious. A button, like they might have in a sink with a vacuum cleaner in an office building. Luckily I knew where he was. Anyway, after a couple of more turns, find this huge treasure room (remember, all this is below Manhattan!) Full of all kinds of historical golden things. Riley arrives to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And the FBI official, Harvey Keitel, forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and allows the two tracks without chemicals to get married. <br /> <br /> For any viewer, I think it would be hard to ignore the whole exhibition, the leaps of logic, and stereotyped characters for a long time. Although part of his exposition involves good history lessons inserted into the conversation at random moments. I would like to have more conversations like this in my life.
