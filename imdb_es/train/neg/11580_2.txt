If you want to see a mystery, do not look at this. Although there are elements directly from the territory of Elmore Leonard, this is closer to an episode of "Dynasty", since the filmmaker focuses on the "development of characters", that is, long and boring conversations between stupid characters and without participation. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotic"), but it is not. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
