How many more of those fake "part of life" movies should be made? Hopefully not too many. <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a very shy attempt by director Peter Solett to attract the attention of Hollywood. There is nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this particular film is that it ignores the audience and stacks up on every clich√© in the book of supposedly "avant-garde" independent Hollywood production. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be "real", so the paper should be shaken. "documentary style" of the camera, except that no documentary maker shakes the camera on purpose ... <br /> <br /> It is "avant-garde", so do not waste your time lighting the film. <br /> <br /> It's "hip", so we're going to have kids use bad words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on, and so on. All you have left is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood that will not impress anyone out of the "rarefied" indie crowd that still seems to be acclaimed in all bad movies.
