With that line begins a dull and boring British science fiction movie. The Great Vorelli from the movie "Doll's Wrist" builds a teleportation machine for Blanchard to cut off his funding, a bearded man who cares about neckties and men with big eyebrows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself into Blanchard's house with the help of his laboratory assistant, Sheila. It goes without saying that something goes wrong and ends up looking like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to the good orange-haired doctor who walks through London, surprising people with his mutated hand and a diaper on his face. There are some more murders, some modest paper jobs and, finally, the doctor disappears where the rat-faced doctors go. Fortunately, nobody decided to make a sequel.
