... because if I was, I might have wanted to be crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this film, and I'm being "generous" with which there was even a plot. As mentioned above, it is an inappropriate name on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is really the star. I was just in the movie. And if in fact he was "frustrated", as the back cover indicated that he was, well, it's probably because he said that he was in this disaster of a movie and could not come out of it. The film really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what was supposed to be his role in the film, apart from the extreme approaches, was not as big a mystery as what Gene Barry's role really was, or was not. And speaking of "great" ... who had the brilliant idea of ​​placing Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty outfit, which showed his pants literally lifted up to his chin, should be condemned to hard times by watching this movie drugged. I could go on and on about how horrible this movie was, from the dialogue that does not match the mouth of the "actors" (think of Clutch Cargo), to the erratic leap from scene to scene (again, being generous even calling frames). images) "scenes, to the lack of an argument ... However, if you like the genre of the early 70's and you're in a country house in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of children's photos and cats, Recommend having a good bottle of wine before embarking on this strange journey of a movie because you will be grateful not to remember it the next day!
