If I had not read "Union Street" by Pat Barker before watching this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Actually, it's my kind of movie, it's well made and by no means I mean the opposite, but as an adaptation, it fails from all angles. <br /> <br /> The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a working-class area of ​​northern England grabbed my heart and I refused to let it go for weeks after it was over. They brought me tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that I sometimes felt I could not read anymore, but a novel I simply could not stop reading. Depressing yes, but completely exciting. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh darling. Hollywood took the truth and the reality of Barker and shed a layer of sweet icing sugar on top. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into the character of Fonda, their stories are touched, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's stories are delicate and too horrible to watch in bulk, and that a movie with around 7 main characters is not practical, but content is not my main theme. The essence and the true instinct of the novel are lost: the darkness and the rain, the broken windows covered with cardboard, and the stench of poverty described graphically is replaced by the sunlight, the beautiful houses and William's score. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of "reality", I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like "Schindler's List" ... but without the happy ending.
