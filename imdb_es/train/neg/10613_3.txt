The dance was probably the ONLY observation of this movie, and even that was disappointing compared to other movies. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of film, one that assumes that it is a work of art because it has all the characteristics of the film as art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately it lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film is supposedly surrounded. The tango is a joke, it is hot, it has drama, it is bold, precisely what this film is not.
